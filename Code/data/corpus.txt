Ha-ha-ha. Okay, now make him look angrier! Nope, not funny anymore. Sorry, dude—you ruined it. Yo Finn, did you order a brick? [Reads the floppy disk that is taped to the brick. It says, "Email to Finn + Looks like Ice King's handwriting. Alright, alright, hold on. [ Open video and... Potato trampoline... Then crashment! 47 grapes! [talking to Chocoberry] Okay, shh, you're safe! [Chocoberry's arms and legs fell apart then disappeared.] Aw, man. Okay, here is my dream plan. You were wearin' tights made of green feathers. These tiny green feathers. And I was this wisecracking coelacanth that only ate popcorn. Anyway, we were in this— Hold on, I'm almost done. So we were trapped inside this huge egg, and after a while you started dancing in this kind of sign language. And then Ice King's glitchy stuff started eatin' my dream up. I peed in my pants, but you went up and talked to it. You just... talked to it. Yeah, tell us your feelings! Get deep. "Sllabfoog uoy pleh tnac I..." Slaw frog yokel snacky. Snacky slaw frog yokel. Sea salt yack let a snacky. Yeah, that sounds good! No, wait, dude. I think I cracked the code! AAAAAAH!!! This must be the universal source code! Huh? Okay, enough exploring already. Where is this glitch guy? I'm gonna smash his jimmies. [Looks to the front and cringes in fear] Oh, no, my arm! [grabs arm.] We had so many great times together... Dooby, dooby, dooby, dooby, skeebily, skeebily, dapdy doo... Huh? Who's that? [Sees it was Righty] Awww. [confidently] Let's do this... for Righty! So, hey, Finn, how do you plan on taking this guy out? Okay, I guess it's worth trying. Aah! What we do now? Hey, Finn! Remember that gross video Ice King sent? Let's double team these locks! [Bites Finn's hair and starts swallowing it along with Finn. The glitch gets more glitchy. As the glitch roars and starts coughing, it pukes out all of the things it ate from the universal source code. Weird, random stuff starts to happen, it loads and the land of Ooo starts reloading with the candy people. By a pond, Finn and You should wash your hair! Everything back to normal, huh? Yeah, no big deal. Geez... [PB and Yeah. Where is he? I wanna kick his boingloings, too! Hey, brother. Pass me that jam, won't you? Thanks. Pretty good. Funny, though, I can kind of taste the toast's emotions or something. Getting ground into flour and then made into bread really did a number on this wheat's sense of self. Nope. Same old Where's this coming from Whoops! Tuck‐tuck. See? Same old Whoa. [ Hmm. I think I'm handling these minor changes pretty well. Besides, a lot of people are different these days. Dirt Beer Guy, you're practically a zombie. How are you dealing with it? So you agree Finn is really overreacting? Heck yeah! I'm still the same old You know, I think I figured out why I make people uneasy. They're used to yellow [Laughs] Lady, that tickles. It's okay, lady. Thanks for trying, but I'm fine, really. I love me, too. Jermaine? That's the mountain? Yipe! Dad? This isn't just a dream body, this is what my body looks like when I'm awake. What? Finn, you up? I had a really bad dream last night. So ominous. These images are going to haunt me for, like, forever. It was a weird scene, all right. Chanting ladies, labyrinths, classical sculpture. And Jermaine was there, too. The weird thing was that he was painting abstract art. It's not in his nature. Why would he all of a sudden get into painting meaningless shapes? Just feels so out of character, you know, for Jermaine. Just squiggles. [Looks at a postcard of the mountain Jermaine was painting] I knew I had seen that mountain. [ James, it's me, Okay, but I don't want any beans. [Gasps] Where did you get that painting? You like this? It doesn't look anything like a mountain. Where'd Jermaine go...after? You mean a waterfall? What have you done with my brother? Jermaine. We're practically twins. Hey, Bryce. I'm looking for Jermaine. Is he behind that door marked "private"? Yeah, he used to be. Now you got him painting all this nonsense. What's really going on, Bryce? My dad told me all about your demon tricks. Bro? I'm here to save you. Jermaine, what's wrong with you? Who's taken away your identity as a landscape painter? No, I just look different. No, it doesn't! Nothing's different! I'm the same! Same old This looks bad, but deep down,I'm not different. And you're not different either, right? You'll go back to painting landscapes? 'Cause you like your brothers to be crazy shapes? Huh? I wonder what he meant. Well, do you have any more of these paintings? The shapes are always changing. Changing is their normal state, like us. Even if we're not changing on the outside, we're changing on the inside constantly. There's some stuff about me that I've been ignoring for a long time. I'm afraid of that stuff. But it's part of who I am. As long as I know the shape of my soul, I'll be alright. Oh, I totally don't understand anything. Yeah, I went to see Jermaine. He says hi. Huh? Different, yet the same. I don’t know. I’m the "first come first serve" kinda guy. Get in line, ladies! This Rainicorn thing can’t last forever! [chuckles] [Magic Man peeks out from under a strip of grass, unnoticed by Finn and Well, no. I mean, if you feel something, you feel something! [ What about them? [Looks confused] Whoa! Wait! Did BMO say something to you? Oh, I see. You’re being weird. BMO and Ice King? You’re creepin’ me out. [Gets up] Oh, is that what you’re doing? I’m not! How could you know that? You can? [in a mocking tone] [Pointing to the bag] Hey, what’s that in your pants? Crazy. [Finn opens the bag and reaches in] Careful, dude. What the heck?! Are they alive?! [They are now moving around aimlessly] Maybe it’s black magic. Maybe we shouldn’t mess with them. Yeah, that’s good. How many more thingies are in there? I’ll make a special spagot [spaghetti] with a new sauce. [stirring the noodles] Who’s in the C-list? [Adds something, possibly wine, from a bottle, then dumps some spaghetti onto each plate] That’s not very nice. [Turns off the stove and brings the food to the table] Involved with what? [Sits down and gives Finn his food] [Stretches to get forks. Lady and Princess Bubblegum are having a conversation. It looks as though Princess Bubblegum is asking Lady questions] What are they talkin’ about? Whoa! What kinda narrative are you trying to create here?! Alright, well, what else ya got goin’ on? Ice King? He’s not C-list? [Little Hey, Finn, eat the food before it gets cold. [Pops up from behind Flame Princess and Lumpy Space Princess] I made a new sauce! Umm, earth to Finn, are you okay? [ [Comes back to the table with a drink in a mug] You stay up all night readin’ trash books? [Finn makes a weak “meh” sound.] I told you, man. Those datin’ books. [Sips drink] That stuff is mess you up. [Drinks again] Oh, let me see little me. [Stretches his head to find little [Confused] Wha? [Angry] Who?! [Hears Lady laughing and goes to the source. He finds little Finn in Lady’s lap kissing under a book teepee] Ahhhhhh! [Slams his fists on the table] What the ball, man?! What? What do ya think “what”?! [slowly backs towards the exit] I don’t like where you’re going with this. It ain’t wholesome. I’m gonna go to Lady’s for a few days. To clear my head. [Leaves] I’m back! I got over all that messed up stuff you did. [The tree house is covered in trash and Finn looks awful] Yeesh. You okay, man? What’s little Finn doing? [Looks concerned] He looks sad. What’s he thinking about? Where’s little Rainicorn? Wha? [sees Lady still crying in her teepee] Aww. This is messed up, dude. You’ve crossed the line from weird curiosity to some dark messed up stuff. [Marceline has licked away half of Peppermint Butler] The destruction! [Xergiok looks like he’s in pain and Turtle Princess is furiously spanking him] The depravity! [Choose Goose, Abracadaniel, and Lollipop Girl are all tangled up together] The wrongness of it all! I’m taking that bag back to the cliff where we found it. [Tries to grab them but Finn grabs his arms.] You can’t! Just let them do their own biz, man! How would ya do that? But he can’t hear you. Hmm. Maybe we’re on different dimensional planes and the border between our planes is like a two way mirror. So we can see him, but he can’t see us. Try shakin’ him. Maybe we’re vibrating on different intervals. Try shakin’ him at different speeds and see if he responds. Now go faster! Faster! Go slower, he saw you! Whoa! Neat! Now what? Is that gonna do it? [The little people join the party and start dancing] Get the C-listers out. [They begin dancing as well] Good party. Oh, flip! [BMO and the Ice King are dancing] Look who’s hittin’ it off with the Ice King! [Chuckles] [getting up] Sorry CB, we'll finish this up later. Hey, Lemongrabs! You home? [smacking a Lemon spider off his arm] Kiss it! Hey! Weirdos! [stretches his hand into a slice of cake] Get the birthday cake! What the thing is up with this guy? What? Where should we go? I wonder who put them in there. Oh, cool! [going through hole] Yeah, thanks, man! [turns around] Hmmm. Hmmm. Yech. Um, maybe we should hands... for safety. So, where'd you want to look ne--[looks at what he's holding, which turns out to be a green Lemon creature that starts licking his hand.] Eeeh! [yanks hand away] Uh, Finn?! [closes door] Nope! [running to door] I think this is it. Maybe the kidnapper's in there, too, coercing them. Ah, stop, man! You're just makin' it worse! [makes fist huge] Let's just get this over with. [punches down door] Fix the door? What?! What? Fix the door? Fix--what? What's goin' on here? Fix the door. Finn, what's goin' on? Fix the door. You know there's guys starvin' up there?! You can grow new food now. You really are gonna die. Yeah, but look! [points] He's heading right for the Candy Kingdom! Giant poison candy aspirin! [holds up large pill] I've got this one, but it might be too small. Yeah, but we'll never find it again in time... unless that's it there [points] with the juice coming out. Remember all that juice, from before? [climbing in] Tastes like vitamins. Are you sure this is it? It's not even doing anything. Right. [grows hands and hits the heart hard] But how come we don't just fix their hearts like we did with Lemonjon so they're more selfless and less selfish? [Slurps] I was just sipping my coffee. [Slurps] [Slurp] [Slurp] Oh, yeah? Yeah, are you a spy? You know, 'cause of the overcoat? What are you selling? I'll take it! [He takes the lint.] Can I pay you later? Good attitude, BMO. [Whispering back] I know. Poor little guy. Still wearing out the shoe leather trying to make just one more lousy sale before coming home. Still, it's tough seeing your kid get his heart set on doing something he really sucks at. What the heck did you sell to get this silver goblet? Hey, you know what? We'll just go buy back those little pearly whites. I'm sure whoever bought them is like, "Why did I buy these things?" What possible use could some guy have for a set of human baby teeth? Unless he's an evil sorcerer or a mad scientist... He wasn't a mad scientist, was he? Just don't let them climb into your mouth! Hey, there, bitey boys. Get off of there. [More babies attack Me too! [Smashing babies] These baby-smashing hammers are great. Mmm... Is that special sentient sammich? BMO, you're my little cherub. You know that? You made all this for me, right? Aaahhh. Naaaw. What? No way. Poo deal. I'll do 20 minutes. Okay, fine, fine. Three sammiches for every hour I'm a horse. Deal. Om! Mm. Oh, yeah. It tastes alive. Okay. Om. 'Kay. I did try. Horses are hard. How's that? Wha... So, what's the plan anyway, BMO? Ow. Yow! BMO, that hurt when you dug your boots into my side belly. Are you gonna apologize or... You have 45 minutes left before my next sammich. Hyee! BMO, I'm tired. Oh, that's where you been? Neigh! No. It's been fun, BMO, but it's time to go home because there are no more sandwiches. Which direction is the house? Finn, is that you? Look... It's me-mow, BMO. Whoa, did you have a real gun all this time? Meditating. Wait, dude. I'm connecting to the internet with my mind. Check it out—I downloaded a little dance. [Begins to dance] Look! It's Princess Bubblegum's rainicorn! She looked like she was crying. Yeah! Yeah, let's do it! [Grows huge] Rrrrroar! She's flying into the Ice Kingdom. Seriously... but what are we gonna do? What's up? [Puts on the binoculars] That guy is a total patoot. Whoa! And there's Princess Bubblegum! Yes, please. [Jumps in the air] Howop! [Booties are thrown up into That was totally math! Oh, my goodness! I'm 28! Hey, how's it goin'? My name's [To Lady Rainicorn] Are you kidding? I play the viola too. You are crazy. You are so crazy. Let's go! Hey, sloppy milkshake! Why don't you pick on someone your own size? Whoa, what is going on? Go where, dude? We don't have anything to do. I don't see any adventures going on anywhere. I think we're good to just sit here for a while and just talk about our feelings. What time is it? [Sits next to OK. You seem kind of dump trucks. You know, "in the dumps." [Looking weirdly at No, no, no. Leave it up to your daddy and uncle Finn! [Kisses [Driving a fake bike he made shape-shifting] Ding-ding! [Stops] Scre-e-e-ech! [Walks up to a fake door he made shape-shifting and presses the ring after which a farting sound is heard] [exclaims] You just gotta sign for it, to prove you accepted delivery. [Hands out his clipboard-shaped hand] Yeah, just give it a little jerk. [Closes the suitcase] Hey, sweetie! Sweetie, look! Your time machine's all ready! Aw, anything for my baby pup. [laughing] Time machine! [Presses a button, when suddenly the entire room gets covered in a red light] No way, man. Well, now you know we can't jump off of birds. [The fat Clown Nurse waves a cookie around, mimicking airplane sounds and plops it into I don't know... but I'm feeling better already. Ah. That tickles. No, keep going. [The big Clown Nurse continues smooching Oh, yeah. Huh? Ah, no thanks. I think the kisses work better. [To nurse] Excuse me, don't stop, keep going, please. [The big Clown Nurse resumes smooching Hey! We all have our own ways. [sets table] Finn, lunch is ready! It's good! I learned it from Rainicorn. Dude, this took me, like— Whoa! [grabs a shrimp from his plate before he leaves] Eh. Apples? All of what? [patting the air] No ghost doodies. Oh. Oh, wait. [feeling something invisible] Oh, no. No. Hey, guys, I found something! Look! Oh, the Candy Tavern, man. I used to hang out there back when I used to snatch old ladies' purses. Don't worry, I stopped doing that a long time ago. I didn't know it was wrong. Be cool, man. You're gonna queer the deal. Hold on, we gotta go potty. What just happened? Hey, Finn. [pointing to mark] What's that on your face, buddy? Y'know, I think I seen that symbol somewhere before. Yeah, right next door to where I used to hawk stolen bikes. I didn't know it was wrong. [points to a building with the mark] Yeah, you see? That guy must work here or somethin'. Here. [forms a ring on his finger and shows it to Wormo] Uh, yeah, why? Wait, you mean "apples" as "diamonds"? "Apples" as "apples"? And that's why there weren't any footprints around the tree! As innocent as a baby's butt cheek! Are you up to it, TT? Well, that's normal; people always have weird thoughts around campfires. What?! Nah. [tosses stick into fire] [turns towards Finn] What's wrong with tummy rubs? Alright buddy, [pulls his skin over himself] that's a little too much campfire. Time for bed. [extinguishes the fire with a large hand] [Wakes up] What is it, boyi?! [thumbs up] Let's do it! Eh... It's not really time travel, though. You just, you know, moved their stuff around. You didn't really manipulate time. Ice King's done it better before... with magic. Eh, I guess, but not really. I mean, Ice King did it for real. Guy pulled his fiancée out of time from a thousand years ago using magic. [laughs] BMO? What did you do? Hey, hey. Don't worry buddy. We're Finn and Hello, there. Hey there, DMO. I am JMO. But nothing's moving down there. It's all shut down. What happened to this place? Uh, what question? I'm serious... Hurry, Finn. I think he's calling the police or somethin'! Ah, we gotta hustle! Dang, man, how deep does this place go? Cram your tram! [ Finn, how are we getting to BMO's driver port?! My bod! Wait, what's up? Dude, how old are you?! [ Wait, did you say you built a million robots? Hey, what kind of coffee do you want? That's terrible. Nooooo! Stop! Yeah. Excuse us for a moment, Strong. [ She's crazy, man. She's a fish person! Dude, she tried to eat Peppermint Butler! She'd probably be worse if she was so scared of everything. Oh, I'm coming with you if only to be disruptive and obnoxious! [Scoffs] Fish people. Fish People! I'll be, um, a dolphin! [Turns his head into a dolphin shape; Hyoomen gasp and Grrr...[Susan squashes him down out of the way.] What? Hey, hey. What? Oooh... I'm on a boat with a couple of wackos. Shakin' my hips, and dippin' my fat toe... In the water! Dippin' in the water! This party's gettin' hotter! It's so hot... it's stupid. So where we headed, Susan? Oh, no. Oh, no. No, no, no! No, Susan, no! Dude, she's crazy. Whatever, man. This is a crazy cruise, and Susan is our crazy captain... and I'm a crazy clam-shell! Woo-ep! [Morphs his head into a clam and starts dancing] Oh, doing the clam! Hey, you hearing that too? [Closes clam head] Huh? Uh-huh. Finn, let's get outta here. You know, I could just stretch us over this thing. She's flippin' crazy! Come on, Finn. Let's bail. That looks like... my father. ...Now I'm crazy! Oh, thank Glob. What's making all that swishing? [Laughs] It's just more pool floaties! Susan! Susan, Lub glubs are just pool toys! [Turns his hand into a pickaxe] Watch, I'm putting an end to all this craziness, with my Pickaxe Hand! [ Ooooh... Bad news, dude. There's only two of us and more than, um, [Looks at his hand and holds out all his fingers] this many of them! Yes! I'm okay with that! I'll do whatever Susan says! [ [Catches it] I gots it! Finn, win aide to fair Susan! [Grunting] Almost... there... [At the top there is a furnace with straw that says "Light Fire Here."] Oh, so I just toss it in here? Pretty straightforward. Okay, well, here I go. [Swinging the lantern] one, two, three... [The giant Lub Glub grabs his arm and roars] [In a trance] That reminds me of... my mother. [ Whoa. It is beautiful. [On the boat with pretzels] C'mon, Finn, let's go! I grabbed, like, 100 soft pretzels! I-I don't know. I think I'm still asleep Then we're sharin' the same dream, dude. [points] Look out your window! Whoaaaaa! [stretches back to Finn] Hey, man, I don't think this is a dream. [digusted] Ughhhh, monster guts. [stepping in something squishy] Bleh. [sliding behind him] Eeeeeeee! Ohhhhh. It's gross! Well... we should go. They're partying! They're fine. Well, it goes into your stomach... ...and then it stays there for a bit, and then it turns into—[gasps] They're all gonna turn into... the stuff! What's goin' on? Bye! You're the chief. Dude, we've been partyin' for hours. Full-blown. It's kinda peaceful. [puts his finger over Finn's mouth] Shh. Seriously? The only foreseeable threat might be all these trees being swallowed, but they're not hurtin' nothin'. Oh, okay. [disgusted] Ehhhhh. You're sick, Party Pat. I'm gonna go watch TV. [walks off] Move the bass down. Be reasonable. Believe! She's like a million years old! And still looking good! Cool. Uh... It kind of sounds like a good idea. Dude. That’s like the 8th time. Why don’t you just get rid of it? It's gross as butts, man. We’re taking care of this right now. See ya larder! [perplexed] Huh. [underwater] Thar! [agreeing] I know. It's in his tone. [ And how ‘bout our treehouse? The house part’s a-gone! I guess we went through some portal to the past or some biz. [looking around, yelling] The sea lard! [ Lard, lard, lard, lard, lard You are crazy. You are so crazy! [smiling] I like it. Yeah, this place ain't safe. [waves] Hi, Purple. I'm Ginn and he's Fake. Hmm.. Thats not right. He's Ginn, and I'm... wait... [To Finn] Weren't we supposed to not do something with the purple things? [pleasantly] Heh! What a great gal. I don't know, man. [Playing in the purple] But I like these things. Uh.. maybe? I'm petting the ground, boy. [wrestling with the sea lard] Am-boosh! [Agreeing] Yeah, I don't think it wants to be a rolling pin. Rolling pin trail has gone cold. I see. A pink pond. The pond has a face and is talking to us. [excited] Yeah, pie! Gross! And then there was like, a PB puddle, a Marceline plant, and a little bee that looked like you, BMO! You know what? We didn't save the sea lard. The sea lard saved us. [Turns around] And there was even a purple lady kind of like you, Ice King! She even sounded just like you. We didn't. Beat it, creep. [curious] In what way, exactly? Man... let's go home. [Sighs] But, Finn, I'm gettin' all cranky around my joke-hole. Oof! Whuzzat? Dude, no!! Don't touch that thing! It's probably got some kind of sacred significance. Finn?! [The light dims down and Finn's face can be seen on the lamb; Finn has disappeared. We'll get through this, my bro. I swear, I'm gonna get you out of that lamb. [Going over rocks as he pulls himself out] Ow. Ow. [Hits the entrance] Ow. [He exits.] Wish I knew how to free you, bro. BMO, stop fake-farting. Hmm... [Normal view] That's it! We'll do all Finn's favorite stuff 'til he comes out! BMO! Play Finn's favorite song! Are you hearing this, buddy? Alright, Finn. This oughta free you from your body prison. Couple-a' rounds of Kompy's Kastle will jog your psychic schnaps. That's what I think. Co-op mode like we always do! Oh, yeah! C'mon, Finn, drop the drawbridge. Kompy's blood lust meter's goin' down. Lemme help ya there. [Pushes the second controller's button; the drawbridge on the screen goes down.] Whuzza!! You love Kompy! [Beat. NO!! [Evades Ice King's attack] Finn's trapped in here!! You donk! I will smash you!! WAAAH!! [Smashes Ice King's armor] [In shock] Whoooo?! Whoa! Finn, is that you?! Finn! Finn! Finn! [The lamb falls and breaks. Ice King and Finn reappear.] Whooooaaaa... [Embraces Finn] That was beautiful! Let's go flush this in the sacred bathroom! Boo! That was pre-written. It's so obvious! Take him out, Finn! Awesome. What's going on here? Who's that? His special Lady? Oh, man, I'm sorry. Well, I hope you guys get back together. Whoo-oop! [leaves] There for you, bro... but Finn, I'm gonna tell you something gently. Get a new sword. Bro, these guys could've hurt you. Bro... It'll be okay. Let's go shopping! Hey! There's Choose Goose! [looks at Finn and runs toward Choose Goose excitedly] Goose! Come on! [realizes that Finn has not moved and runs back to him] Finn? What's wrong? What? But we have history with him—that's important in business. [winces] Ooh. Yeah, okay. I asked around. This is the place to get sa-words. [motions to a grass tipi in front of them] Well, that was easy. Hey, the pillow vendor! Huh? Pizza?! You're getting good with that sword. You were never able to do that with your other swords. Pie! He's gettin' really good. He saved me from pizza. I like it when Tree Trunks gets all serious. Uh, how's that curse doin'? Makin' you want to moidle me? [laughs] Well, okay. [tries taking the tag off his pillow with his teeth] Dang tag. Hmm? [gasps] Hey, quit showin' off, bro! Good idea. [puts the pillow in his bed, gets on top of it, and starts sleeping] What's goin' on? Huh? Oh, snap! Don't worry. I'll handle this. [wraps his apron around the sword's hilt and sheathes it in a baguette] There. Huh. Hey, he's not here. It's the Hooligans Who Love Candles! Dude... [winces] Don't give up, man. Hey, maybe Choose Goose knows where the old man went. Hey, Choogles! We need your help. We gotta find the dude who sold us this cursed sword. You know who he is? What? Come on, Choogie, it was only one time. Awesome. Wizard of Grassy Moun-tayn... Mountain. Yeah, thanks, Choogs. [screams] Now that you've accepted it, you can control it! [laughs] Do it again! [laughs] Why don't we call, like child services? Or an exterminator? Ugh. Uh-huh, uh-huh. [shrieking] It's baloney! It's baloney! It's Starchy's baloney! I just got to think of something wholesome. [Jumps with a lion-shape shield.] Oooooooh! Get him out! Did he get you with his poison stingers? Let me see. Wow, that's a tiny splinter. Oh. [Punches thimble] This dude. [Points at Finn] Say what? Yeah, man, you're gonna do it! [Starts to go and Sir Slicer shows up] Yeah, what a bumbleberry! What's the poem say? [Feels the poem] Hmm... It means that we have to cross that swamp. You don't just read the poetry to understand it. You got to [feels it] feel it. Trust me, dude-- I'm smarter than everyone. Now get in there! No way, man. This armor thing is your deal! [ You okay, man? [feels the poem] Hmm... Ooh! "The meadow weeps as morning sings of milk and honey and things to come." It means we have to silence the echoing in the woods. [they hear echoing and look over a bush to see what it was] All right, I'll handle this one, dude. Then just make her think it's her idea. That's how you make the ladies do what you want. Ha ha ha! She thinks you're her red-faced baby or something. I think she wants ya to nurse, dude! Huh? Yeah! Just you wait, weirdo! [Just then, a shadow cast over Yeah! How? He's already dead. Finn, its so beautiful! [Makes okay sign with fingers] Click-click! Put on the armor! It'll protect you from evil, even ghosts! Hey! Uhh... Yeah! [In a high pitched voice] Listen when your mother is speaking to you! [High pitched voice] You should be ashamed of yourself -- a boy your age sitting in this cave alone for thousands of years. You need to go outside and get some sunlight! [High pitched voice and is pointing] No back talk! Outside! Now! [normal voice] No problem, dude. I couldn't have done it without [pointing up] the power of embarrassment! Good one, Finn. Whatever! [Picks up Finn with his butt and flings him on his back] Come on, dude, let's get out of here. [Flies over Sir Slicer with the armor] Wa-hoo! [Flies over the 3 mountain tops, breaking them] Dude, this armor is totally Click-click! Naw, man, I'm in the kitchen making us breakfast. [Grumbles] Alright, hang on out there I'm comin' [Clatter, grunts, and yells are heard as it sounds like [Noises continue as Hey, a bubble! Pop! [laugh] Oh, it's just BMO, he's pretending to be all messed up because his bubble got popped. [chuckles] What? I don't do that kinda stuff anymore. I don't know... Maybe. No! [Sarcastically] Oh, Finn lost his sock! Everybody stop what you're doing and help Finn find his precious sock! [reopening the cupboard] BMO! Ya see, man? That was really fun. You don't need two socks to have fun. Our chicken's name is Lorraine? No. It was from when BMO was playing dress-up. Do tell. You never talk about your family. [scoffs] Joke's on you, man. We spent all our treasure the other day. Plus, don't even have any wives. Lady's my girlfriend. That was Tree Trunks. Yeah, yes... [panting] I mean, except for this sweet armor, though. This armor is hot like fire. Hey, there's stairs back here. [panting] Wait up. Yeah, why are you singing the money song? He blizzed it all up, man. [gasps] [falling backwards] Woah. [holding on to swan feathers] Ahhhhhhh. I don't think we can. He's a giant. [sigh] This armor is driving me nuts! You don't stretch, man. This thing's cramping my crimps! [grunting while stretching out of the armor] Woo! Eh, garden stuff, I guess. But Neddy's from the same place you're from, and he's a wet hot dog around everyone. Nachos? Naaaaa... chos. Yeah, whatever. Yeah that's great, get it out of here! Move your face, you're messing up the game. Anyway, I don't wanna talk about it, it's personal. Cats know what they did... Eugh... no! I'm pretty dang far from okay! There's a little shard of Tortilla chip caught between my teeth. [tries to use his tongue to get it out] You think I can stretch out of everything? You're so naïve. To live life, you need problems. If you get everything you want the minute you want it, then what's the point of livin'? You forgot the most important part, my impatient little friend. A thorough rinsing! [Puts water in mouth and starts rinsing] [Spits out water] Bleh, nothing. [shakes head] I need, like, a toothpick, or something. Floss is for losers. [walks out of the bathroom, and to his cards on the table] Oh, one of these will do nicely. Just the edge, kid, then I'll work it like a pro. Now, to find the card that best suits my devil-may-care personality. Hey, BMO! Ta-da! Oh, I didn't. It's still there. [reveals teeth] It'll be like a constant reminder of what life's all about. ZIP IT! Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh! [Chuckles] Eh, I'm trying something new. Hey, how's it going, miss...? Whoa. You're a dead ringer for Flame Princess, with a smidge of Princess Bubblegum mixed in. [To Finn] Guess you're still hung up on both of 'em, bro. Naah, [Draws Lady Rainicorn on the dirt] don't let me interrupt you. You two have fun. [Worried] Finn! [Requests] Now do the thing I like. Hehehe, classic. [Stretches out his left hand to Finn] Alright Finn, that's enough. [Pulls Finn out of the water] Woah! Hold on "mama." [Pats the foil] Okay bro, tin foil's on. You can hug now. [Weird smile] Looks like your date went pretty good buddy. Bro, you gotta let things take their natural path. Look, look [Turns right arm to 15 small stairsteps], let me explain some junk about dating. Right now, [Points left finger to first step], you're at Tier 1, which is hugging. But pretty soon, [Points left finger to second step] you'll be at Tier 2, which is smooching. Then down the road [points left finger to fifth step], you'll make it to Tier 5, where she'll let you discover all fifteen feet of her loong, beautiful stomach. Then after awhile, you'll make it to Tier 8 [points left finger to eighth step], where you touch her horn for the very first time. Very special. [Warns Finn while pointing his left finger at him] You stay away from that! Do not do Tier 15! [Undoes the 15 small stairsteps] Don't worry about it dude, just let things naturally move to Tier 2. Oh and um, you need a shower dude. Probably. What are you doing here? Oh. Aah, he's just smelly from a day of running around with his lady-friend. Uh, I shouldn't say. It's his business. That's his personal biz, you gotta respect the man's p-biz. Flame Princess! He's hanging out with Flame Princess! And I don't mean to be telling stories out of school. But pretty soon, [lowers voice] they're gonna be taking it to Tier 2. Oh, it's possible. [Confused] Mmm, weird. [Gasps] President Porpoise! Ok Princess, you need to stop breaking in here. Uh, ok, [lowers voice] Tier 2 baby! What? Where am I? Oh my glosh! [Starts dancing] [Groans for 3 times] [Groans another and regains consciousness] He stepped out. Oh, oh! [Thinking Princess Bubblegum is jealous] I see what's going on here! Oh man, PB is totally jealous of Flame Princess! What's up man? She doesn't want you see Flame Princess anymore. She's crazy jealous! So, you at Tier 2 yet? Nnoope. I know exactly what'll get you Tier 2.... A "sappy poem." [Takes Finn to the bedroom] Say something about her "spectrum." [Snoring while sleeping] [Taps the frying pan] Back off, Bubblegum! That's his "man's biz." [ [Shocked and Gasps] [Panting] Finn! Are you alright? [Difficulty of handling Finn keeps increasing. He slips and covers the entire hole.] [In pain] It's hot! [Still in pain] Geh.. What about Finn? [Coughs] [Weird smile] Jeeeaalous? I keep finding baby shoes! WHAT THE HECK, MAN?! And they're all lefties! Sorry I'm not finding any loot. Aww. Building this gauntlet dock is hard, man. Hard work sucks. Incoming iceberg! I got dibs! Ooo. I hope it's not baby shoes. [Gasps] It's a guy. You know what they remind me of? Well-dressed pickles. Whoa, don't roast 'em, man. You gotta flambé. Ah. Perfecto. Bon appetit. [Knocking on one of their heads] I don't think they made it. What kind of business do you do? Yes! Help us fix that dock. Yeah! Right over there. But they're begging for it, Finn. Just look at 'em. Finn. These poor souls are lost without jobs. We can't ignore their plight. [To the businessmen] Go on guys, fix it up! Of course, man. They said they "love work for you." Told ya so. [Laughing] Yeah! Woo! [Panting] See? If we hire them full time, they'll be back in business and we'll be able to focus on fun stuff. Everybody wins! [To the businessmen] You hear that, guys? Maybe I'm right! Yeah, mans! Relax, man. This is your day off. Uh huh. Cool! [Groan] Me too. These cubes are... frickin' resilient. Hey, business dudes! Hold off these cubes so we can catch our breath? These guys are great, right? That's 'cause you had time to rest your body and refresh your brain. Yeah! Good work. Got 'em! Oh... Lost again! What's that? Oh, wow. Anything going on? Freakin' awesome, man. Takin' care of business. Yeah! Holy moly! Woo! Yes! Yeah. [pushing around Finn's gut] You're gut's so huge and moldable. Hold on a sec! [Impersonating Ice King's voice] I'm the Ice King, and I'll never find a bride because I'm such a tool. [Laughs] That's a- Hey, what'd you say? Man, I am not in the mood for saving Lumpy Space Princess. Right. We'll just save our strength for the big adventures, then. Ahh. Nice call, dude. I'm too tired to imagine stuff, but I bet you're right. Yeah. Let the businessmen handle it. businessmen, dude. [Still lying on the floor] Man, just let the businessmen handle it. [Opens his eyes, surprised] Huh? Finn? Whoa... Crud. I'm comin' buddy! Ahh. I'm so fat, dude; I don't know what to do. What? Why? Ok, Alright. [To businessmen] Hey! You guys are horrible at business! Huh? They're sucking me up, dude! [lifting his head up for a second] Ok! This sucks. Oh no! So, wait... What'd you hire them to do? [Sigh] I'm gonna miss 'em. And I'm gonna miss this gut. [ What business are you into? Talk about it over lunch? Hey! We must. [looks up] Stolen. But all we have to go on is part of a name. Pete something. [ Oop, sorry. [opens mouth so there is a hole where the glass would be if he were really a magnifying glass] Aah! [closes his mouth so he can look at the key] Ooh, turn it around! [opens mouth again.] [pulling out a plastic bag from inside another plastic bag] Got some bags and...wait- [pulls out another plastic bag] more bags. But no leads on Pete something. Hmm. Yeah man, that's definitely blood. [ Hello, citizen. Had anyone in here looking to buy some mini adhesive bandages today? See anyone who might be our guy? I really like turnin' into cop stuff. I literally can't stop turning into cop stuff. [Scene changes into We're not criminals, man! We're working the beat, just like you! Not yet we didn't! [Scene turns to show If we cut through the forest, maybe we can head it off at the pass. [ Ehh, I got this. [ Save it for the candy judge, Pete. You do the crime, you do the time, man! Burgle our friend, it's the end. [morphs his hand into a giant fist] For you! Let's ball. [Finn and We are awesome at being cops! [while eating a donut] No question about that. [ I told you I have a problem. I can't stop! Yeah, good work, BMO! Tomato sauce? But how would pizza sauce end up in a hotel room? [whispering to Finn] Or maybe he's out tying up loose ends! Danger! [Finn and Shh! [morphing into police car] Huh, huh? Come on pal. Turns out the only case here is just another case of LSP being nutty! No. It's nothin'. Ha ha. You're a charmer, Finn Human. No... it's... well... Lady Rainicorn doesn't wanna play the game Card Wars with me. I always beat 'er... so she says, "No more Card Warring." It's a fantasy card game that's super complicated and awesome, but—well... No, it's kinda stupid. Never mind. Really? Well... I thought you'd say it was for nerds who do not know how life is outside of the nerd universe. Thanks, Finn. Oh, hey, BMO. You wanna play, too? Ah, whatever. Let's play the game. How about... the loser... is a dweeb, and the winner is a cool guy? Coffee ground, beetle butter, grape jelly, kimchi, and... this stuff. [It's a bottle of pink liquid that says "HAM CHUNK JUICE."] We drink when the game is over. Now lemme explain the rules. That's basically the basics! So once we have our kingdom set up... [Floops land cards] ...it's time to start to play. FOR THE GLORY! [Finn wakes up with a dazed "Whuh?"] Hey, were you asleep?! I'll have to explain it all over again! But if you don't know the rules then you're gonna lose in the first couple rounds, like Lady always does! And then you'll hate the game, and then you'll hate me, and then... and then... Haha! Bring it! Oh... you, uh, floop your land cards. Keep those honeys hidden, or I'll get a strategic advantage! Okay, I go first. I floop the Silo of Truth! Pfff, you got really lame cards. Hmm. I'll take the Cerebral Bloodstorm, though. Okay, now it's the battle phase. I'm attackin' your schoolhouse with my Husker Knights. [Activates Husker Knights] And I'm castin' Cerebral Bloodstorm! [Does so] So, what'll you use to defend? [Laughs] Of course not! What?! [Laughs] Okay... okay, first of all, you don't floop a creature to make it fight. You activate a creature. [Gasps] No... He's eating all my cornfields! My Husker Knights draw energy from corn! [His knights collapse.] [Big gasp] You just wiped out my entire attack!! CORNFIELDS ARE AWESOME! What makes you think you know so much about Card Wars?! ...Your turn. You're supposed to discard a card and pick up a new one first. Look at you. You're a babe in the woods. Your beginner's luck ends this round! Spirit Tower?! And the Cave of Solitude?! That's it? You're not attacking? HA! Then the seas have aligned and the five winds waft the smell of victory to my palace doors! I cast Field of Nightmares and activate my Legion of Earlings to scare your Pig to death! Um... I cast Teleport—to move your Pig to the empty field so I can attack 'im! You're right. I'm gonna slay that Pig, though! Hmm. [Gasps] You're the cool guy, huh? Well, lemme make it a little hot for you, then. [Flooping Volcano card] Heh heh heh heh... I floop the Volcano! Hmm. Maybe. [Chuckles deviously] The Pig is dead. Now I reconstitute my cornfields using the Reclaim Landscape spell! [Does it] My Husker Knights revive! And I still have my battle phase! Hiding in the Useless Swamp... the Immortal Maize Walker! Cornfields give the Immortal Maize Walker triple damage. I told you cornfields are awesome! Your Ancient Scholar and Cool Dog won't survive this time! So what? NOOOOO! YOU GANKED MY SPIRIT WALKER! AAAAGH!!! [Runs away from the table and angrily mutters incomprehensible words to himself] [Makes a strange, low noise] Your turn. YOU PLAY! YOU PLAY! [Retracts] Play. The. Game. Well... I've still got my Wandering Bald Man. [The Wandering Bald Man gets stuck in Well, that's stupid. Just attack with the Immortal Maize Walker and get the game over with. I... OHHH-HO! Ohhh, oh, yeah! Pigs can't leave mud landscapes once they're on them! Hahaha! The Pig is mine! First, I'll play Reclaim Landscape, then I cast Summon Archer Dan! You have no creatures left. That's the game, boyee!! The five winds blow through cornfields once again! For the glory of Jakoria! [Slams Finn's face on the board] In yo' face! It's time to drink up! It looks like you are the dweeb and I'm the cool guy! [Drinks from the "COOL GUY" cup] [Finn sniffs the "DWEEB" cup and retches. WHAT?! AW, IT'S GROSS! Yo, yo, yo, yo! Bubblegum sent me for the bucket. Merci and adios. It's good, you know? Uh, Marceline's got all her powers back. She's getting ready to give the Vampire King a big, fat whompin', uh, I hope. That would be weird. You're weird. [walks off] [imitating trumpet] It's the herald of a new snack dawn! [pours food out of the bucket] [eating a burger] I love you, Bonnibel. I like this plan! It's got good bones! Oh really! Why don't you step inside for a nice chat? [runs at the VK in the shape of a spike closet with stakes for spikes] Whoops. [shapeshifts back to normal] [to Vampire King] What happened to your pants? Hold that thought! [As Finn is about to land from when he was launched, [turning around] What? [using same code] "What does full blast even mean?" [uses one drawn-out fart to say] "Well, what do you want to eat later?" [waving his arms around] Best makeover ever! [half-asleep, reaching for the bucket] Mm... buckie... That's funny. Hey, man, there's absolutely nothing wrong with you. Yes, you are. Run back and tell her all the stuff you've been telling us. Maybe you could pick up from a place you Haven't been yet. He didn't bite you, did he? Ah, just keep watching. BMO said the second act gets crazy. What the stuff was that?! No. [Holds up rice patties and a dead fish] Hey, y'all ready for some sushi burgers? Uh..Sure. I just sculpted these buns though. [Carrying four bowls of chips and ice cream.] Okay! Food's done. [Finn and BMO cheer] Well, now I'm a guy with these things on my head. I guess I'm just gonna roll with the punches. Maybe if I put a towel over my head they'll go to sleep. [Grabs a towel from the wardrobe.] Heh. Yeah, okay. [Puts the towel over Chips and Ice Cream] [Grumbles and sits up while Chips and Ice Cream continue to talk.] All right, that's enough. They're going outside. [ [Grabbing at some fabric.] I got to get to the farmer's market before all the choice stuff is gone. He is?! Quit clownin' around. So, you want me to pick up any snacks? Okay. [Puts a light blue piece of fabric on his head like a bonnet.] Later, dude. [Looking at two apples.] Hmm.. [Turns to face Morty Rogers.] Oh hey, Morty Rogers. [Continues to spread mayonnaise on his piece of bread.] Listen. Even if I could find Morty Rogers again, I don't know how to get these things to go back to him or even if they want to. [Singing.] I love you, Chips and Ice Cream. I hope you never leave. You're totally slow dude, speed up them gams. Ready to admit it's harder than it looks? Heh heh heh. Actually you did pretty good! Hey check it out! Looks like a giant dead turtle. Yeah, get your glasses on grandma, this kid is pure. In fact he's about to help that little crying kid. [Penny is shown crying.] [stretching his stomach to look like a face] We want to turn your frown all the way around. [twisting the face he made on his stomach] I'll face the other way, but I'm gonna keep doing this. Oh boy. Yeah! We're gonna purify that city! Crud. And then I'm gonna beat your purity outta them. [lightly punches Finn] And then beat a sandwich into them! [grunts while throwing air punches] And then beat them to the punch! And then punch 'em! Okay. You're going down, turtle! Woah! I want jets! Hey! We can steal a new one from that guy! [ [reluctantly] Okay. [tiptoeing towards Baskets & Boots and whispering] Just gotta steal these boots... Huh? It's the city, it's getting to me. Help me, Finn! Thank you Finn, thank you. Uh, what are these? [show bells tied onto his hands] Oh. Hmm. [shakes bells] [sighs] Comin'! [ Huh, what? What boots? [looks down] Oh, no! I stole! The city! It took advantage of me! Yes, I can. [runs up to the barrier and gets knocked back] Oh. [chuckles] She already did, man. You see, if you have too much earwax, you won't be able to hear anymore. Woah, woah, woah. Easy, kid. Hey, that's enough from you, Hag! [puts feet around Hag's face and throws her away] [walks over to Finn] Finn? Come on, Finn, keep it together! I'm not gonna leave you alone in the city. You're my buddy. Besides, I stole these boots. These super-big style boots. So I'm just as dirty as you are, Finn. We gotta walk this filthy path together! Cowabunga! [stretches into a cape for Finn] Hi, Penny. Watch out, Finn! [shoots boots at Penny, making her drop the knife and fall down] Yeah, dude. Nice work, dude. Woah, dude! [rubs Finn, making squeaky sounds] The soap got on us, too! Woah, dude. Why are you naked? [Finn is shown wearing nothing but his pack and underpants.] Let me see! [trying to get the binocular] Come on! Let me- [grunts, sees through binocular] Maja's got smoke coming off her. I don't know, but they're flippin' freakin' me out. [Normal Man, Betty, and Maja disappear.] Guess we better tell PB, huh? Hey man, don't even worry about all this war stuff. I know we'll find a way to fix this thing. Come on! You'll see. [Stretches, taking Finn and heading toward the Candy Kingdom.] We saw Normal Man and Betty flying around with Maja, and they were chanting. [to Finn] What if PB's right about this? Maybe she'll just go whup Gumbald's rear, and then things'll go back to normal. Finn? That's my cue! Hya-pow! [Hops and throw the Nightmare Juice to the ground.] Yeah, man. You can basically do anything in dreams. Oh, this sandwich is way too much for me. Jermaine always liked splitting sandwiches. I want to help you, [suddenly wearing a waiter suit] but I can't lose this job. [Looking Fern trying to fight Finn; sighs] Everybody gets an evil doppelganger but me. Jermaine, you're the best! [Laughs and hugs Jermaine.] Hmm? [Notices a Finn-shaped door appears on the wall] Finn, we'll be right back. Mm, I can't quite picture it. But I'm pretty sure Finn buried it here. Yeah... [confused] Huh? Uh, Lady, where's Jermaine? Aww, sleepy puppies. Yee! [Steps back in horror] And I'm done! What? Oof! [dragged by Lady and falls down; gasps] NOOOOOO!!! [collapses and weeps on the ground, while his body detaches with Lady, with his rear sniffing around, digging into a rug.] Huh? Oh dang! [Finn's vault is found underground.] Is that... Finn's vault? [suddenly, a giant fog of fart erupts from his rear] Aargh! Nightmare fart! Repressed memories! [Brings the vault from the portal. A note on it reads "THIS VAULT BELONGS TO FINN AND FERN"] Proof! [Opens the vault.] Ah, don't worry. It's just a dream! My bad. Yep. Uh... we saved the day. So, maybe that big baby's here to give us presents for doing a good job? [Comes out under Finn's hat] I'm also staying. [Turns into a horse for Finn to ride] H-H-H-Horse! War is the worst, dude! [Finn and Don't worry, guys! [Jumps off] I believe in you, Ice King! [Contains the birds with his body but soon overwhelmed] Aah! I didn't think this through!... [ [Stretches; follows them] Okay, Okay, bud. There's no reason to freak out just because the tree house is [despairing] GONE...! [Pants] Ah! BMO...? Ah no, man! Your little face! [Shushed and picked up by BMO] Jump him! He's gonna wish to be all space villain! He's a big evil alien stuck in a penguin! Oh, never mind, I think he just wished to be Ice King? And for some drums, I guess? Yeah, this is fine. You feel ready? Whoa. Night, PB! Music is powerful, man. It speaks to a primal pit in our brains. It makes anyone wanna get up and get their knees goin', gotta get 'em pumpin' pumpin' pumpin'. Boompa-boompa-boom. Sure! Everything burrito! [Finn gasps and [Sets the burrito down] Ready! So cute! Haha! I can't! I'm paralyzed by the cuteness! [Suddenly worried] Huh? My burrito! No, Finn... They probably poisoned it! They knew my name. They knew about the burrito. [somewhat worried] Oh, nothing much. You know, just... chillin'. [Beat] A little. Yeah. Thanks, buddy. [Finn rests. She always knew just what to say. Goodnight. [Fade to black. Suddenly, I think someone's in the house. [Finn makes a tired groaning noise as he lights a candle.] For real, man! Shh, listen. I swear, man! I really heard something. [Footsteps are heard, and What the—?! That's my sword! [Picks it up] What do they want with my sword, man?! [Finn makes a worried face. There is a sudden noise downstairs.] [Whispering] It came from downstairs. Where are you going? [Beat] ...What?! [He follows.] Oh, no. OH, AWWW, NO! [Drops his sword] Awww, no! It's a dead goat, man! Its guts are all over the place! It's all chopped up and spread around and... [Looks closer] Ah, no, wait, it's just a blanket. I think I left it here this morning. Aaah! Aaah! Shake 'im! Shake 'im around 'til he stops! Okay. Now tell 'im not to talk about our mom! Hold 'im! Well?! Do you believe me now, Finn?! Well, that's close enough. Let's start settin' up some barricades! There's gotta be a thousand of 'em! [Not scared anymore] These guys aren't a threat to anyone. Wanna just smash 'em all? What?! And mess up my stats?! [Reluctantly] Alright. Who're we gonna call? Ketchup is delicious and deceiving! [Falls over and feigns death] I'm dead. BAAAHAHAHAHAHA! Ah, I'm sorry, everybody! Ah, I couldn't keep it in! Hahahaha! [Licks some off his fur] Tastes better than blood. Or does it? Hey, Finn, you think blood tastes better than ketchup? Aw, nuts. [Shrinks down to Cute King's size] We wanna apologize for being fakers. Finn, look! [Pointing upwards] Hey, there's our guy! Woah! [Finn, Nice! Let's go say hi. Don't sweat it, boy! Finn and I got yo' back! Vaguely, yes. You don't remember making that wish! I thought I explained it to you that one time. Oh yeah, I noticed that! [whispering to Finn] His boss! Who's that? What is it? [takes off snow goggles] What's that thing now? Lower it! Wait, wait, wait. I don't think that's what we're supposed to do. Prismo said take care of him. Are you being stupid on purpose? I heard you the first time! Bro, you heard Prismo, we don't have a choice. Alright, you're right. Shut your eyes and cover your ears! [exhales] A man needs a maid [shows Ice Finn]. [Exhales and wipes sweat off his face] A man... needs... a maid. A maaaaan [shows Ice Finn], needs... a... [shows hey, hey! Nah man! Let's just go steal the Enchiridion. Finn, I love you! Just in case we eat it fighting this guy. WAIT! [stretches] Straight up magic! Yeah, check out my amazing wizard bod! [Farmworld/Ice Finn looks at Finn] Hey over here man, look at me! I'm a portal to another world. [shapeshifts into a portal] I'm magic, I can do anything! Don't you believe your own eyes? [Finn is sneaking towards the Enchiridion. Farmworld/Ice Finn is distracted by Why anything? Why's the sky blue, bro? That's right, just keep looking at me! Enter the por- What? Big Destiny? That's my body, dog! Come on, that's the lich! He's evil! And he's not even trying to hide it, bro! We're not a gang! [Farmworld Lich approaches] That's you! [sees Farmworld Lich] AAAHHH! [tries to punch Farmworld Lich by stretching his fist, but Farmworld Lich stretches to catch the fist] [being held by the lich, falls asleep, with green in his eyes] Huh, what the? [black gas goes down his throat] [pushes the Lich's hand off of him and into the portal] Gross! Woah! Mathematical! Hang on Finn! AAAHHHHH! [Farmworld Lich is trying to get out of [Farmworld Lich is struggling to get out of him] It's like the most evil heartburn! You're Welcome! Ha, I don't know what he's saying. Let's bounce. [is sent back to time room] D'aaawwwww! Hey look how dumb I am in that world. Here's me. Woof woof woof! Hahahahaha! I eat stuff off the ground. I don't know, what are dogs even into these days? Yo, man, what's going on? Oo, that's cool, but do you know what's really cool? Tough Guy contest! [flexes bicep] Whoo-hoo! [Does a spin and poses] Tough Boys! That's impossible, Tree Trunks exploded in the scary dark forest after she ate that Crystal Gem Apple, remember? Come on man! Tough Guy contest me! [Flexes his bicep] you got what it takes to rip-it?! Then let's get it on! Hee-yah! [Holding out his arm] Do it, Finn, do it! [clenches fist.] [His face wrinkles up trying to hold back a single tear. The tear is sucked back into his eye and [Quickly grabs for Finn's chest and twist.] I'm gonna break out! [he begins to inflate in size.] [Laughs and continues to inflate] I'm breaking out of my fat! [red and inflated] I win, Finn! Finn? [He finds that Finn is beneath him and quickly deflates] Finn, Finn! Are you okay?! [he rolls Finn over.] [Touches Finn's face] I was just messing with ya, dude. [Still concerned] Are you okay? Oh dangit, We were just playin' and then I got out of control! I'm sorry, dad. [Teary eyed] But I don't want to hurt nobody! [Covering his ears and wails] Noooo! [Snaps out of it and tosses cup] Whatevs', daddy! [Huffs and crosses arms.] [He continues to huff, turn, and then another huff to sit on the couch.] I'm never going to hurt anybody, ever, starting... now! [Sitting on the floor sipping coffee] Finn, you're okay! I was afraid I mashed your potatoes too hard last night. Nope, no more, dude. I never wanna lose control again, man! I'm going totally soft [body becomes blob like.] Mmm hmm. Whoa... [Still sitting with his coffee] Hey, you guys, put my bro down. Finn! [runs to the portal and jumps through.] Hey, man, what happened? Okay, I'll try to do it using 'controlled conversation' [rolls over to prison's door way.] Hey, man, I'm [Purses lips] I wanna know why you took my buddy and I'm not going to use force to get it out of you. Whose orders? Ah, man! Can't we work this out like gents? [Smashes into a crystal and gets a vision with his father speaking to him.] No, dad, I gotta control myself! [His body morphs thin and long as he slithers back over to the doorway] Control, control, control, con-trol. Whoa, okay okay. I'm hatching a controlled plan. Alright, man, move out of the way and let me get my friend. Then I'll have to move you myself, [zoom in of his mouth] with my mind. [Putting his hands to his head he concentrates intensely.] [His face gradually reddens.] [He stops once a fart is let out and breaths heavily.] Finn! [pumps up] Don't hurt my buddy! [gasps] No, No, no punchies! I am in control! [covers his face and cries.] Nobody, man, don't look at me! [runs away crying.] [Punches a crystal and puts his head against it] Stupid-ghost-dad! I'll show him! [calmly] Okay, intimidate them with controlled attack. [Morphed his body into a tall wall like appearance] [speaking a deep voice very slowly] open up! Feel my controlled attack! Whoooomp psssh [lightly punches guardian's face] Whoooomp psssh, Oooo oooh psssh. I'm not hurting you am I? Well, there's a lot more where that came from! So you best tell me why you're turning Finn into a crystal. So, help me I will touch you! Finn, oh no! Nooo! My bud!! [shrinks down.] [Runs over the crystallized Finn] I'm sorry, Finn, I'm super lame and now...you're dead. Oh. That voice. I'll try man, but I'm still figuring out my bizz, [stretches his legs to reach her height] here I come, Tree Trunks! [lightly touches her trunk] Taste my gentle rubs! She's too sassy and powerful! [gets thrown at a crystal.] Jermaine?! Are you dead? Oh, I'm sorry about that time I beat you up. But dad, you said I was going to hurt everybody! I don't know, dad, that doesn't really help me. Oh, well then I'm over it then! Rarr [charges back into battle.] That must be giving her all her powers! [Morphs his foot into a giant boot and kicks Tree Trunks in the stomach.] TT, you're back. Oh shush, Tree Trunks, if I had a penny for every time someone went crazy hopped up on magic energy... I'd be Abraham Lincoln! Alright. Whaddaya wanna see next? Alright, I'll try to turn into a cheetah farting. [Turns into a cheetah and makes a long farting sound while moving his face and tail around his body.] I can't do the spots. Did you squish the sparkles? Oh, snap! [Claps once] Well, plop that cartridge in the slot, playah! What?! Dude, take your hands off your head. Whoa, dang! Whoa!! Uh... [Makes an "I don't know" noise and shrugs] Whoa! Burgers and hotdogs! Yeah, yeah, YEAH! [Runs towards the food] [Stops] But... burgers and hotdogs.. Yeah, so? Mm-hmm, I remember. Aaaahh... But Dad, Finn's already figured that out. He's a good kid with a kind heart. Okay! But— [Putting player in backpack] Finn! Ugh... Let's take the flower path! Because... you're super gross, man. Um... He said he's surprised a whiny baby like you made it this far. Mm... [Frustrated sigh] Because... you cry like a baby... Baby! [Nods] [He turns and notices the fruit witches laughing.] Whoa. [Mocking Finn; feigning crying] Waaaah, I cry when people die. Waaah, I'm Finn. Dude, don't eat that!! Time to go, baby. [ Rrrr... Yah! [Grabs Finn and runs] There's another cartridge. [Finn makes a long, sad fart noise.] Alright, man, Dad told me not to tell you this, but— You're not real. [Turns the imaginary Joshua into an imaginary Lady Rainicorn which kisses [Sighs, grabs Finn and slides down a slanted wall with Finn] On this next holo-message we listen to, when Dad tells you to cover your ears, don't. [Lets go of Finn] Finn! [The monster beats Finn badly.] Dude! Use your karate biz! Dude... Dad loves you! You know I don't think you're a baby, right? That sword is sweet! Yeah. Yo BMO, you done chargin' up that phone or what? [Takes the phone] Thanks, BMO. Alright, man. We're gonna figure this out... right... now! [Flips phone open. The phone loads and the video begins to play.] Yo yo yo yo, check it! This is [Turns camera over to him] Whoo! Yeah, baby! Alright. So, this is the Nightosphere, I guess. [Puts head in front of the camera.] It looks banay-nays. [He turns around] Marceline says they got tons of crazy ways out here. [Moves out of the way and Finn and Marceline are seen inside a cave. Finn is holding a tambourine and Marceline is playing the banjo. [Walks over] What offer, Marceline's dad? Ow, my hippocampus! Well... that explains how we got amnesia-ed. [Pulls out banana] But what about banana? [Raises arm] Whoa, dude! [Points to Finn] She told us never to come back! Mhmm. [Does so. Finn, now, has his outer clothes off. He is now in his tight-whitey underpants. Now, he is putting on his pajamas.] [Does so and growls.] What's your disguise? Nice! It's us! Finn and These guys won't help you. They're all complacent sheeple. [Begins to do a little beatboxing.] [Uncertain] Okay... [Begins to beatbox] Aw, sick! Ahhhh! I'm too freaked out to move, Finn! These demons are nibbling my legs! [Pans down to show many demons biting and crawling on No, Finn! You'll be filled with chaotic evil! Dude... seriously. Yeah. Don't you know about Super Porp Day? Today's the day when Squeez-E-Mart always gets their monthly shipment. [mutters gibberish] Okay, listen. So, okay, we could go track down the mysterious source of Super Porp. Do up a fuh-real, end up fightin' some big soda-computer-god-baby or whatever... We totally could. But... Super Porp is good. So why question this good thing, man? Why? Alright, well, it's one month later. Aw, yeah! Here it comes! Ugh! I jinxed it! [throws can on the ground] [Shocked] Whoa! [Points to Finn.] Don't let the dragon, drag on, man. [Whispers to Finn] We should get out of here, Finn. I think someone called the heat. Whoa! Intruder! Finn! There's an intruder in here! Ohhhhhh. Do you think that'll goin' to do the trick? [While lying in his bed] That's cool. Goodnight, Finn. Haha! Yeah. [Wakes up] Hey, Finn, you wanna have dinner instead of breakfast today? Finn? [Wiggles his ears] That must be him. [Gets up and goes to the door] [Opens the front door. Walks up to Davey] Uhh.... What's going on? Finn what's going on? Oh, no! Have you lost your teacups, man? Uhhhhhhhh........ Gotta figure a way to get Finn to act normal. [Then he sees BMO running in circles dressed as a robber] Ah! Give me the wallet! Or feel my claw! The wallet! I'll cut you! I mean, rob you! [Takes randy as a hostage] I'm a robber and I'm gonna rob this guy's life! And there's nobody who can stop me. Unless there's a hero around here. [In a suggestive tone] Like there's someone here who is actually a hero in disguise. They can probably stop me. [Runs up to Davey and whispers] C'mon, Finn. Be a hero. Butt out, Randy! [Whispers.] Yes, Finn. Put on your awesome hat and beat me up. I'm not talking to you, Randy! Wait, what? Guys, it's not what it looks like! That guy isn't really named Davey. It's Finn! He brainwashed himself to become Davey and I was just trying to inspire him to go back to being Finn. [Shouts to Davey.] Finn, don't let the dragon drag on, man. Don't let the dragon drag on! Davey?! Finn! [Walks up to Finn] [In Finn's pocket] Glad to have you back, buddy. Yeah. Time to make sleepies! I know! Okay! Uh… okay. Whoa man, who knew Peppermint Butler was so- [Clings to Finn as they both scream.] So… um… you wanna… [Stretches out a kangaroo pouch] hop in my paunch and I’ll stretch us down? Let’s go! Wait up, dude! Follow me, and do as I do. [The two begin to slowly side-step to the entrance] Ha ha, we’re in! Come on, man! Yes! [Points to the top of a hill] Up there! Death’s castle is pretty, dude. Hey! If you love flesh so much, then watch this! [Stretches so he looks like he is melting onto the ground.] Don’t worry! They just think we’re cool! [Coughs, skeletons are biting him as well.] They’re tryin’ to peel me! [Stretches largely and knocks a bunch of skeletons off of him.] I… am not… a banana! [Grabs Finn and runs away. He sees a hole.] Hole! [Puts Finn in the hole.] Sorry! [Jumps into hole and covers rocky with it.] Oh! Sorry. I don’t know. Wouldn’t be so bad if there weren’t folks trying to eat our skin. No she said she’s coming back "on the Morrow." No man, the Morrow is her bird! It’s her bird! That thing is crazy fast! It’ll only take like twenty minutes to get back once that conference is over. [Camera pans on a shocked Finn.] Are you listening, man? [Camera pans on I thought it would be funny! Heh, awesome! River! [They walk down the stairs towards the river.] Man, I’m so thirsty! My mouth’s still all dusty! Come one! I’m so thirsty! See? That means good right? [Cannon-balls into the river.] Who’s Hey! I don’t know who you are, mister, but I don’t like your attitude! Help! Somebody! Help! Somebody help me! Stranger danger! [Peeks out from behind tree] Huh? [To Death] Who are you? I don’t know, man! Who are you? Well, I didn’t know! Hehehehehehe, this kid’s pretty funny! Oh, man! Skeleton guy by a landslide! He was like "Rughhh," he was like [Makes exploding noise]. What? Skeleton guy was awesome! You want me to lie? That’s me, right? [Stands up] What’re you doin’? What’re you doing?! Awh, gross! I wish I didn’t! Yeah, what is it? Quit bein’ silly, Peppermint Butler! [sniffs] Blech. Your tooth looks bad, dude. It smells like a garden shed in here. Finn, I think you have to go dentist. [sighs] Just go dentist, dude. [approaches rotten tooth] Okay. Easy does it... [presses against tooth] [screams] [exiting mouth] This is so bad. What did Princess Bubblegum say when you showed her? Dude. You. Got. To. Go. Dentist. Come on, man. It's not that bad. Right? Whup! Yeah. Welcome home, buddy. Ah-ah-ah! [points to fly spy] Aha! [He takes the diamond and places it alongside a few others in a minecart.] Oof. Thanks, dude. Digging up diamonds for a little project. Whew. Hehe. [He begins throwing away more diamonds.] Vanilla no mods! Vanilla no mods! Vanilla no mods! Vanilla no mods! Au contraire, mon friend. I'm extremely senseful. You see this bucket of water? It's in case I fall in the lava and catch fire. Or [throws more diamonds]. You do you, buddy. [Indifferently] Uh huh. Pie. Oh yeah, you were gonna make something right? [They both begin eating the pie.] I like this better. Hmm. [Reading aloud] 'Make more friends with sing-talking.' ♪ ♪ Hey there, Finn! Whatcha reading? ♪ ♪ Ha, that's a dumb story; I love dumb stories! What would you change about yourself if you got that treasure? Fix your weird cursed grass arm so it wouldn't be weird and cursed? How tall we talking about? [Mockingly] Oh, I see. [Leaning back] I wouldn't change anything; I'm the whole package. [Falls backward] Whoa! Everybody knows all you need is a mirror. No, it's a yurt. Hey look. The treasure. Okay, here it goes. [Shakes snow globe] Oh great treasure, make my taste buds think they're tasting fried chicken even when I eat my fruits and vegetables. I don't have any fruits or vegetables on me. I guess I'll find out later if that worked. Your turn. This place is depressing. We should have known better than to trust a book. Finn! You're awake! Oh, I was so worried. I've been waiting with a bowl of soup. It has hoops and loops and maybe some goop. Don't worry. You're gonna be fine... [Looks away] in no time. I'm not. I don't know but it probably has something to do with your weird old eyes. Heh, it's fine. I think maybe the eyes are the treasure. No, because I don't want to be this awesome sweater bro. But maybe that's how you see me. Whoa! Do you see Shelby as a bookish nerd? Ah ah. Before we go... [ That's how you see him? That's beautiful. There. Come on, let's get you home, dude. Peebs, good luck with the speech. Okay, at least now we're safe from you donking up any more of our friends. You turned him into a microwave. So...yeah, you kind of did. Uh, Finn. Finn! You're being melodramatic! Hey, buddy. I figured you'd come back here. Baloney! You turned Neptr into a microwave because he's a microwave. But that doesn't mean that's all he is to you. I know you think Neptr is an interesting person, and I know that "microwave" is just one part of his personality. I mean...maybe your eyes are just bad at describing things, you know? Like how you feel about people, what they mean to you... That stuff's in your guts. Eyes can't grok that... Unless you have the eyes of like a trained artist or something. But you don't. I'm telling you, man you're not a bad dude like this skeleton bro, or you'd be turning everyone into rats and plops. Now come on. Look at me. What?! Di- Wha... Well, at least you're listening to me. And wise old Finn's just the best guy to do bro stuff with, like lying on the grass and talking to bugs or baking chocolate chip cookies. Finn's just a good friend. Safety! [Jumping out] Patrol! Safety patrol! Safety— Oh... Were we not wearing the uniforms? What is it, dude? Just looks like an ordinary little town, man. Ya jerkball! Ow! [To himself] Whoa. Whoa, I zoned out there for a bit. Did you win? Donald, quit all this jerky nonsense! [Forms giant, tree-like ears] Unless you wanna get gored by a forest prince! Donny is one mixed-up dude. You're a mixed-up dude, too! What? [To Finn] You sure this is a good idea? You are not an outsider. You wear cute little blue shorts! [Putting game in BMO] And hey, can you put on some pants?! I have pants... [Grabs transparent pants] spun from spiderwebs... by pixies. Not cool, dude. Finn, I don't think this is gonna work. Ooh! Teach him that little empathy song I taught you! Dude, trade me jobs. Butt, butt, butt! Yeah, Donny! You're lookin' good in those jeans! Miraculous, isn't it? I just kept teachin' him my musical rules, and now, he's perfect. [To Finn] What're you saying?! If you don't encourage his talent, he might revert back to jerk Do— [In realization] OHHH, OHHH! [To Donny] HEY, DONNY! EVERYONE SAYS YOUR SONGS ARE SUPER BALLS!! [To Finn] C'mon. We can go stare wistfully at the lake. Oh man! Alright, what's next? Wait, what about the movie at the drive-in? Whoo! [Stands up and runs off] Let's go, apple pie! TT! Oh yeah! What'cha ya doin' here? Cool cool. Yeah, my stomach is jonesin' for it bad! [Stomach growls] Dude, come on, we heard you. Tree Trunks... you gonna bring some pie to Princess Bubblegum's thing? Well... Okay... [Turn around and begins to walk away with Finn.] See you later then. [Stomach growls and he begins to look around.] Where is she? [Stands up on bleacher and walks over to Finn, and puts his hands on his shoulder.] What? [Puts both hands on Finn's shoulders.] Yeah, yeah, yeah... [Walks to the side of the bleacher and groans.] Is that-?! [Sees someone and gasps.] It's Tree Trunks! Pie! Pie!! [Lays down.] Lay it right here. [Points to stomach.] No apple pie?! Have you seen my other shoe? Ahhh! Under my shoe?! Outta here! [Spreads something on bread] You shouldn'ta bought so many flavors! I had to make a sandwich for each flavor, and for each flavor combination! [Chews on pieces of bread.] Try harder! Yeah, looks like the cost is clear! Aw, man! I can't ignore that! [Points towards the screen, which is completely covered by Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig's  shadow. Entire crowd groans and protests in disgust. Stoooooop! [Dragging Mr. Pig] So... where do you live? Oh... [Trying not to cry.] Go. Yeah. Mmmm, apple pie I've been waiting to kiss you all day! [Shoves face in pie as the episode ends.] Whatever you want, mama. Ow. Ow. Ow. Don't, dude. For you see, that's the secret entrance to the Dungeon of the Crystal Eye! Legend has it that the eye rests in the deepest chamber of this accursed dungeon. Man, we shouldn't even be talkin' about it, 'cause it's lunch time. [holds out picnic equipment] Maybe after lunch. *Pfft* Yeah, right. Without the aid of my magnificent powers... [shapes hand into bottle opener and opens a bottle of water] ...Huh? Huh? You'd get killed down there. Nope. Come get your sandwich. [using Finn's sandwich as a puppet] Listen to [sighs] I better go after him. Oh, my... [makes out with the sandwich] What? Finn! I was looking for you, knucklehead! I was so worried, that right after lunch, I plunged into the dungeon after you. Strangest thing, though, I kept runnin' into obstacles. Uh... I choose... sandwich! [He grabs his sandwich and fights with the reaper who simply cuts through it with a sword] [voiceover] The challenges were impossible for me. [voiceover] But you would have blown right through. I kept thinking to myself, "What would Finn do?" Just...eh, frustrating. Know what I mean? I'll get us out with Key Hand! [forms a Key Hand] Not a problem, man. Lock Hand! Alright, man. Let's go! We've still got a couple minutes left to steal that crystal eye and win your bet! Just hop on my powdered doughnut, boy! Alright, man. Let's give this crystal eye the old friendship lift. Me, too! [whispers to Finn] Looks like that's not the answer she wanted. What? I don't know. What's with all the weird quest—? Shoot, man, are you still lady-sad about Flame Princess? Y'know, it's okay if you are. Yeah, well, sounds like you're sad. Listen, Finn, girls is like horses. When you fall down, it's important that you get right back on again—on a different horse. And there's a lot of fish in the sea. A lot of fish. A penny saved is a penny earned. Yeah, man, yeah! Eh, well, I suppose. Anyway, I hope this mystery cave we're looking for is as weird as Flambo's brother says it is. Maybe that'll snap you out of the—[stops walking] Whoa! What?! What's this train all about? No one said nothing about no train in the way! Oh, yeah. It's two hours later now. What the stunk? [stretches up above the train, seeing that the train is going around in a circular track] Oh, okay. [stretches back down] Hey, the train just goes in a big circle! We can cut right through the middle, blingle, blongle, blungle! Come on! [grabs Finn and stretches them onto the train] Wha-hey! You know, I just had another idea! If we just stay put here on the train, we could ride it all the way to the cave. [a door opens behind them] Blingle, blongle, blungle! Hey, Finn! Look at all the loot that guy dropped while you whipped his butt! [laughs] Pretty fun, huh? You wanna go see what other kind of monsters are on this train? [following him] [laughs] [laughs] Cool! [picks up loot] [laughs] [laughs] [to himself] Welcome back, buddy. Yeah, this is a pretty neat train. We should come back again someday. Heheh, yeah. I'm just gettin' a little bored, is all. All these cars of monsters are kinda all the same. It's a little boring. All right, just one more. [sighs] Hey, hey! Empty car—think we beat it, buddy. Okay, but this is the last one, okay? Hey, man, [hitting monster with a stick] you remember we were going to that weird cave? Bet it's not too late to check it out. [sighs] Okay. No, thank you. You have fun. I'm just gonna watch. [sits on a ledge away from the fight] Hey, also, man, aren't you, like, gettin' kinda hungry? More than a while, dude. I've already missed my bathroom window! 'Kay! Well, we'll go back to the tree house, and I'll make us some lunch. I could make the toaster pancakes you like. And maybe I can boil up some hot dogs, or— [dodging it] Aah! Ants again? [goes to sit in the corner] [sighs] Dude, this is the ant car. We already did the ant car. We did all the ants! Finn, I think we should take off. I think this place is bad news for you. Finn, [stands up] I made those biscuits with so much butter. You were just responding to the butter! This whole place is butter! What? [picks it up and looks in it] [gasps] Finn! This is a future crystal! Look! That's you, dude! You're old, you're alone, and you're still fighting on this dumb train! Nuh-uh, dude. I'm bored, I'm tired, and I'm goin' back to the tree house. [opens up the side of the train] You can come with me if you want. I'm sorry. If you wish to join me, I'll be in the tree house experiencing the joys of life and not getting attacked by gorillas made out of hair. No, I won't, Finn. [hops onto the outside of the train] Goodbye! [climbs on top of the rain, finding a Hair Ape] What're you doin' up here? [takes off his hat and sits next to it] Are you gettin' sick of things down there, too? Mm-hmm. You're not gonna try and zap me, are you? I wonder what my kids are doin'. [falls asleep] Hey! [dodges zap] I knew it! [walks off] Gotta find that kid. Hey, Finn! [opens door] Fi—oh! [sees someone with a metal helmet, a cloak of fire, and a battle moon] Umm... hey, there, friend. I ain't lookin' for no trouble. Just lookin' for my friend, Finn. Maybe you seen him? About five feet tall, picks his nose, and always kinda smells funny l— Ah, jeez, Finn. I... for a minute there, I thought you were one of those twisted-lost-soul boss guys. Wait, you are! You are one! That's it, man! I'm gettin' you off this train whether you like it or not! [advancing toward him] Oh, please. What're you gonna do? I'm ten times stronger than— Ah, gross! [coughs] Finn? Finn, I'm sorry. I'll stay on the train with you, I swear. Just get this stuff off of me. You mean we're gettin' off the train? Aw, man, don't you see that's just the train talkin'? It's got its hooks in you! [hits Finn's head lightly] Yeah, man. That's what I'm talkin' about. That... is what I'm talkin' about. Whoo! 79th consecutive victory! [stretches his buttocks toward Finn's face] In yo fa-ace! [Finn doesn't react] You okay, buddy? [hits Finn's cheek with one of his buttocks] Still bummed out about Flame Princess? Hmm. I know what'll fix you up girl's night out, boy style! First, we'll go to the salon, get yo hair did and your nails all—wait, no. First, we'll go to the shops, get you a brand new hat. Then, we'll—[toilet flushes] [gasps] [hides in the couch] A burgler-mer! Dude, you can't stay here if you're gonna stank it up with your bad vibes, man! Yeah, breakups are tough. Princess! We need you and your Ball Blam Burglerber right away! Gunter has created a race of strangling snow snakes, or snow-a-constrictors! Aaaah—[gets disconnected] Wouldn't you rather have us fighting evil demons or something? Hmm. [shapeshifted as a trashcan] See anything? Yeah, but not so much in here. It's over, Ice King! Yeah, man, you have, like, one muumuu, and you're wearing it. You're stealing everyone's hangers, dude. Let go! This calls for an investigation. What is it? That's not the expression. Oh, boy, here we go. Hello. [whispers]I'm starting to get a weird feeling. Yeah, he's semi-reformed. Likely so. Eh, I don't think so. We'll probably know when we see him. Look at that weird ol' kid over there. He looks just like you. [It closes up on Finn's father.] Man, look at his clo— [He walks towards Finn who is still on the floor.] Well, it had crossed my mind. It wasn't me! It came from up there! [turns back into his dog form] Also, Finn'ss your son. Ahem! I said, Finn's your son. He came a long way to meet you. [coughs] [gasps] [looks around] Finn, I know we normally come out of these things okay, but I got a bad feeling about this. Just promise me, if both my eyes get fried off, you'll fry yours off too. Dude!! [ Finn, forget that loser! [He glances over at the Lich, then he sees Finn in danger.] Finn! [He takes an arm and throws it to help Finn.] Finn! Let go! He's not worth it! It'll be okay, dude. Oh, yeah, that's the good news I didn't have to! One sec. [He runs behind the large piece of crystal.] Up you go! Check this out! [Finn is surprised, [whispering] Okay, run. Go, go, go! [stops humming] Hmm. [rubs eyes] I'll... I'll finish this later. [yawns and lies down] So tired. And also hungry... [rubs belly] Maybe I should... eat some— [starts snoring] Huh? Uh... [touches yellow grass] Huh. Hmm. Everything's made of... me. Pretty neat. I bet there's, like—like a cool city or something around here. Nice. Oh, uh, hi! [waving] Uh, good, man! Good! Man, this place is awesome! [approaches a storefront] Ooh! [looks through glass] Cool dolls! They look like the rare antique kind. Maybe my kids will like them. Mm. Wonder what my kids are gonna have for dinner. Maybe pizza... Whoa-oh! Some kind of [turns around] Hey there, um... Oh, uh, of course! Goose! Let's see, uh... [counts on fingers] one, two, uh... I've never been here. [fake-laughs] Eh—party? [laughs] Do it again, Goose! [laughs] Hey, what? Uh, what five bucks? What—? What is that? [thinking] Guess I'd better not worry about it. [aloud] Hmm. I'm hungies, Goose. All right! [takes a bite] Ow! Something's wrong, Goose. Alright, lad, show me the way! [follows Urchin] Heh. Okay. Hmm. Mayor, uh, I want to meet these minds. There's no need. I've got it figured out. The tremors are happening because I'll prove it! Mention a food item. What's in the omelet? Look, just let me stretch outside to get something to eat, and the quakes will stop. What?! No way! The world's not gonna end just because I go get a bagel. Uh, peace! [grows in size] Why?! [sadly] Mm. [longingly] Bagel. Spaghetti... [stomach rumbles] [sighs] Huh? Goose? But—but what if Erik Adamkinson is right? What if you and all the But— [eating beans] Just getting a snack, Goose. [sheds a tear] Just getting a snack. And as it waded through the carnage that it had wrought, the vampire smashed their skulls just for the fun of it! Yes way, it did. And also the vampire hunched over its victims and breathed their vaporized blood mist. Oh, it's true, man. I heard it through a reliable source. Yeah. Some say it haunted this very tree! [ominously] Good niiiight... Relax, buddy. I made that story up. I was just trying to scare you. Ha ha! I made that up, too. I was trying to scare you, and it worked! [laughs] Whew! I wasn't scared, I was singing. I was singing my scream song. Ahh! Ahh! AAaah-uh-aah! Don't suck our blood! Um, yeah. Thank you for not sucking our blood. Aw, man. Come on, Finn. Let's get out of here. Finn! She's a vampire, dude! Dude, if half the stories I've heard, and/or made up are true, vampires will kill you. There's no question! A VAMPIRE TOOK IT! Aw, we should go house-hunting. Bag us a new house. Finn, house-hunting is wild! You've got to try it. Yeah, man! It is so nuts! Bla-bla-bla-ble-ble-bla-bloo-bloop! Sweet, things are gonna start going our way. [Clouds separate to reveal the sun] Hey, look, see? What'd I tell ya? Finn, let me tell you a little something about what home really means. [plays viola] La, la, la... [singing] Home isn't a place, let me give you a clue... Home is anywhere, where people care about you... [singing] But, home is where your heart is, Finn! And where is your heart, Finn? Well, it's right here inside you when I'm sitting here beside you! [talking] With your lucky stars to guide you from above. [They look up, a star floats around, then poofs and disappears] I'd rather be dancing with some babes! Ew... Gross. This place looks gross! Yes. So whaddaya think, man? We did pretty good for ourselves. Let's trash it and throw a party! Yeah, man. She's back! Finn! Nooo! Vampires will kill you... remember!? We're home as long as we're together, bla-bla-bleep-bla-bloop, remember!? [yells] Nooo! Finn! I've... gotta help my buddy. [warbles] Uh oh. Finn! Naaah, before she bit me I used my powers to shrink all my guts and blood over my thumb, see? [Does so] Oh, yeah. What?! What happened?! Hey, hey! Easy, buddy! That's our friend Billy! He got possessed by the Lich! [Finn looks very sad and Whoa, wait a minute. How can that be if I'm still here kickin' it with my main man, Finn? I wish that life wasn't anymore extinc— Oh yeah. Jazz. Hmmmm. Let's never do anything boring ever again. I kind of dig getting loosely adapted. [ Warlocks, dude! [ [ [ [They look around for something to happen] I don’t feel like a good boy. [ Yeah! [They high five with plums on their thumbs] [They burst out the barns doors] Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I! [Sticks his thumb in an ant hill] Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I! [He pokes Lady’s baby bump with his thumb and Lady kisses him] Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I! [Sticks his thumb into a flower] Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I! [Finn is holding a chipmunk’ arms up and No, I don’t. [Finn and But we never felt like good boys. Yeah, see ya later, BMO! What the...? This is nuts. Plus, he's usin' my toothbrush! High-five, buddy! Yeah. I was thinkin' the same thing. Yeah. You mean even better. Okay! Ooh, kinda stings! Let's do another one. Yeah! Yeah? You've gone crazy mad with power lust! And I'm lovin' it!! [On speaker] I've been ready this whole time, dude! Just waitin' you to say when you're— [Panting] That... was... awesome... BMO, I've been playing this 72 hours straight. Can I please save after this battle? [drowses and then wakes up] I'm out of candles. Huh? Man, if Finn were here, we'd be doing this in shifts. Oh, well, let's keep grinding. [screams] No! [chills out instantly] Well, I guess that means I'm free. I live again! [sings "My Name Is ♪I'm glad you got a friend now even though that's messed up. Take T.V. to the market to get him into fruits.

Who's that, her ex-boyfriend? So my theory holds. You can still make this happen. Finn, that's not why you're here. Come on. Let's make some magic happen. Hi. I'm also here. Ha-ha! I'm like your sleepover chaperone. You grow up, you teen. Dude, I think I figured it out. You can't summon the Spirit of the Forest 'cause you ain't playing that flute for him. You got a crush on HW. Okay, I buy that for like zero seconds. Hey, dude, are you sure you wanna do that? Seven long harrowing seconds. Mostly, Finn, but also some kind of giant wild pig. Hey! Why don't you tow try playing together? Use that chemistry to guide the music. Yeah, just get in there. Cozy up. Wow... I still can't tell if you guys dated. That's what I'm saying. What? Uh, that's real dumb. Wait, you agree with me or her? It's all about patience and treating each grueling repetitive battle as if it were your first. I'm sorry it didn't work out with Huntress Wizard. She just needs time to miss how cool you are. Well, they look like they're having fun. You think? I bet they taste great if you're a boid. Hey, have you noticed we are birds now? Look over there. That oasis looks pretty good to me. Bon appetit! [Gulps] Come on, man. We're sweet, sweet birds, and we get to eat worms. This is a unique experience. Dude, you've been eating grubs for hours. Yeah, you're a beast. Hide! Who are you? Dang, when did you get so big?... And old? You feeling okay, bro? Ha, really? Why? That's... weird. Wow, you have a lot of saliva. [Chuckles] You must have a broken pipe, old timer. It's comfy, though. Whoa! Did you just try to eat me?! You are trying to eat me. What're you talking about? [Groans] Sorry, man. I'm not into it. You took it too far, man. I'm a dog, and I eat all kinds of horrible things. This is disgusting. [Breathing heavily] We're still in a bind, man. No food, no water. I'm thirsty. [Panting] Hey, look. It's another caterpillar. Huh? You okay? [ She's just a caterpillar, dude. Looks like she's gonna faint. You see? Huh. "Love is Blind"—that must apply to all species. Oh, I see. Your name is Erin, and there's a famine near your town, so that's why you're out here searching for an oasis. Over there—the oasis! Really? You like leaves now? Hey, hey, hey, move over a bit. I got a rhythm going here. [chuckles] [imitating Finn] This oasis is pretty romantic, huh? So, how many kids you want to have? And will you, Finn, take this caterpillar to be your wife, even if she becomes a flower or a bird or a bacteria, to love and to cherish till death do you part? You may now kiss the bride. Hey, why are you eating caterpillars? WooHoo! Hey! Get away from me. Quit it. [Laughs and blushes] Whoa! Whoa, man. Maybe helping this starving homeless guy is wrong thing to do. I don't know. I said "Maybe" [Shrugs] He's magic! I didn't expect this. [with eyes closed and shuddering] Think happy thoughts… Little, cute, bees, little babies, tiny, tiny bunnies. [looks on worried. Finn is shaped like a giant foot, well just his lower half. His top half remains the same] Whoa, dude! What a nutty guy [sniffs Finn.] You smell pretty good. Maybe you're looking at this magic gift all wrong. Now that you're a huge foot you can kick evil's butt, like, way more times as hard. You're 100% kick, man! Don't be a siss, Finn. Here, c'mon kick my butt. [ [rubbing his butt] Ouch! oooh! Ouch. See, man. Let's give your foot body a shot. [ Awesome! Dude you will never regret this. Hahaha! Okay, when the next monster comes along, he'll step on that trigger over there, sending your giant foot body into the monster's crotch! [Caressing Finn] Shhh! [runs away while holding Finn's foot body in the air] Hahaha! What'd I tell you? You're a great hero! Let's go set up some more crotch catapults so we can laugh and be heroes. Finn, being an enormous crotch-kicking foot is a gift. Don't scorn a gift. Town on fire! This looks like a job for foot Finn stomping ability! You can do it, Finn. What'd I teach you, dude? You got it! Now I'm gonna go rescue all the babies in town [deep voice, face close-up] --only the babies. [Normally] Get your hero on, dude! Finn! Oh, I can sense when you're about to cry. It's like a mother/daughter thing. What we have to do is find out what reeks under this bridge [sniffs] Ew, it's blocking out your good foot smell. Ugh, it—it smells like vomit on fire. It's like fancy cheese in an old guy's mouth. Ahh! Do you have any orange juice? Yo, Finn, this place is really bumming me out. Let's get out of here. Yeah, Finn, maybe there's another lesson to be learned here-- To accept what fate has given you [puts his arm around a rat] and stay a miserable foot. Gork, can we stay here in this pile of trash and rats forever? [flops down in trash] Awesome. [Rats flock to his body] Here we go. [rats crawl on his face] Eh, what are you going to do about it? Probably nothing, right? If you're depressed, you'll do nothing. [Rolls over] [Excited] Yeah! [Chanting] Stay a foot! Stay a foot! Stay a foot! Hey, Finn. Heh heh. I can't take you seriously when you're singing, man. Ahh! Yeah, do it, Kim. Whoa! Let me get in on this. I'll form the pants. [ [worried] Finn! [shrugs] Maybe it was, don't give your sugar to jerks. Well, because I kind of always wanted [mumbles] [embarrassed] I said, I kind of always wanted to be a foot myself. It's complicated, man. You'll understand when you're older. Sorry, man. They love me! [the mud frogs lift him up and carry him away] Whoop, ha ha! Nah, man, I like being the frog king. I'm gonna see where this leads, bro. [the frogs carry him away] Man, I don't even want to know. 'Cause I'm the figurehead! Whoops, sorry Breezy. Didn't see you there. That's my sweet neckroll. [ [Finn and Bling! [ Hmm, I could swear I've seen that crown before. [the frog walks by and picks up the crown, causing Finn and Maybe he'll turn into a time vortex. I don't know but I bet it will be un-frog-gettable.[1] [they walk into a field] Nah, man, you gotta kiss him for that to happen. Breezy! Yeah, we'd love to chat Breezy but see we're following this frog just now so, you know. [shows the frog walking towards a cornfield] [pointing] Probably to that sweet water lily pad castle. Don't let 'em get up your pants. [gasps] [shows the frog putting on the shoes] You're cute enough now! [groans, and prepares to walk away] I can't take it anymore! [frog guard holding Dude, how long are we gonna follow this frog? Ahhh, so hot! What! I thought we were following him back to his treasure hoard. There's no ladies! Let's just swim with the water nymphs. [groans] Hey, you! Frog! Look what you're doing to the boy! [quietly] Put on the crown. [angrily] Put on that crown! THAT'S IT! [he stretches his arms and puts the crown on the frog's head] Ha! There, you've seen it! Now let's- eh, what? You take off that crown! [in the stomach] I think it's actually cooler in here. [shivers] How long are we gonna follow this frog? Okay, but why though? Frog with crown. Frog with no crown. What does it matter? Life is short, man. Pssshh psshh psshh psshh psshh! No peace. Yeah! These notes make no sense. It's all gobbledy-gak. Hey, Princess Bubblegum trained her rat to dance. Neat. Let's get out of here! Right. Let's hope this works. We can barricade ourselves in the lab! I think we're good. That door is made out of candy steel. What's the matter? [Sees the zombie and screams] I think I'm okay. It's just a little bite. It's all good, Sweetie. I can stretch forever. Hehehehe...[To Finn, under his breath] Hey, let's hurry up with that antidote, huh, pal? [The infection spreads ups his arm as [Running] You should try one of them books. Over there by the lab rat. [Running] That's great, buddy. Don't come near me, Sweetie! [Gasps] Oh, man, I'm outta shape. I think I should just stay in here, ya know. Just in case. Ya oh. Hurry, dude! Finn! You did it! I huh, uh... [See the zombies around him who swarm him and turn him back into a zombie] Sorry about biting you, sugar. [Laughs nervously and blushes] Oh. [Singing Egg Song to himself.] That's weird. I had a dream too. I'll tell you about it! So then paintings were found and everybody's eyes lit up. Cinnamon Bun smiled and said "I saw it from miles away"... [spits out tea] What?! You didn't tell me the Cosmic Owl was there! Dude, that means it was a prophetic dream! You have to finish the original dream! Cosmic Owl could be whispering something wildly significant! You have to get Flame Princess and Ice King to fight again so you can see the end of the dream! Make 'em fight! [snoring] Ah. [smacks lips] [wakes up] What? Hey! What are you kids doing breaking the treehouse? No way, BMO. This is our treasure. Really? How much of it? Whoa! We get mail? Dang! Wildberry Kingdom got all fancy. I don't know. I've never really spent money before. I've only stolen it or hoarded it. [laughs] [sighs] So... here we are in the middle of town. Let's parse out some dough to spend. Sorry, man. We were just looking to spend some cash in town. [offers three coins] Want some? Whoa. Spending money is kind of fun. Just get the darn furniture. [laughs maniacally] Hmm. [gasps] Look at those gams! Hey, yo, Legs! Legs! You want a bag of money? Well, what are you gonna do for it? Show me. [tosses him a moneybag] [laughs] Finn, look. I made this guy dance. Go away, dude. [laughs raucously] This is crazy. People do anything for money. And I've got a ton of money. Dance harder, Legs! Harder! [laughs] [sighs] This bores me. You're boring! It's time to push this thing further. Middle-class berries, watch after this treasure while I'm gone. [throws them coins] Ahem. Good evening. Listen. I want to see you two do things [places a bag on the bed] for this bag of money. [laughs] Yeah, nice. Goji Berry Man, you sleep on the left side of the bed normally. Now you sleep on the right! Mr. Goji Berry, you sleep on your back now—and on top of the covers. Turning down all this smoosh, huh? Dance instruction pays more than I thought. [starts walking off] Well, sure, man. As a matter of fact, you can have all the gold coins... all the gold coins you can eat! Dinner is served! [dumps a moneybag on each of their plates] Yummy, yummy, yummy. Hey, you kids need some desert? I'll just see what I can rustle up—in the toolshed! [laughs loudly] [walks off] How much do you think I'd have to pay them to lick the dust off all this dusty stuff? Dude, they're not doing anything they don't want to. They want my sweet cheddar, and I want to see some stuff in exchange. It's mutual—free market. Free market! [wheels the barrow to the house] How much coin would it take for you to be my berry foot warmer? Oh, hey, man. Okay, I got a plan. And this time, it's gonna involve all the money. Princess, are you ready to earn all this cay-ash? All of this sweet, sweet crunkle is yours if you let me... [holds up a tiny stool] sit on your head. [scoffs] No one can say no to this much dinero. ♪M-m-money♪ ♪M-m-money♪ ♪M-m-money♪ Or don't do that and get paid mad bucks. Take all my money?! Well, we were trying to get rid of all that skrilla anyway, right? Good shot, BMO! Let's bounce, po' boy. How about you write it, I sign it. [covers ears] BMO... keep it down! I know, but I got a headache, and I'm in a funky mood. I don't know. I think I got restless leg syndrome. What? No, man, it's just restless leg. What are you reading? Cool. [blows raspberry] No, BMO. [screams] No, BMO! No more! [walking into kitchen] Maybe some soup will take the edge off. Ew! Gross! Nasty! [smacks it with a flyswatter] Hyah! I'm sorry you were born a fly and I had to kill you, you disgusting, disgusting creature. BMO, PLEASE! [yawns, smacks lips] [sits up] Finn, was that you? [lies back down] Probably just BMO or something. That's weird. BMO doesn't like 30's jazz. [climbs downstairs] Yeesh. Creepy. [takes the needle off the record] [gasps] [fearfully] I didn't know we had one of those. [panting] Hey, hey. Hey, who? Aah! Hey! I killed you! Aah! [tries waving it away, then runs] Aah! Ghost fly touching me! [climbs upstairs] Finn! Finn! Ghost fly, man! Aah! Aah! Come on, man. Let's get out of the house. It's a ghost fly! No, man, ghost flies are filthy! They carry diseases, such as tuberculosis, polio, dysentery. They leave those little fly doodies on your soul. Aah! [sighs] Thank goodness we lost him. He's gone. [screams] We should ask what its unfinished business is. Ghosts always have unfinished business. Nah, man, let's just get someone to banish it—someone with serious paranormal juice. [dials phone] I think so. His ways are kind of mysterious. [quietly] Thank you. Well, huh. How about that? No biggie. We'll just hang out inside these magic circles until morning. That's when ghosts go to sleep. Yep. Just got to make it... till morning. Don't do it, bro. It's a trap. Dude, what are you—? Yeah, but I'm still getting a "woo-jah" feeling. This seems like a bad idea. Finn? What's wrong, buddy? Oh, Finn, you're disgusting! Aw, that's it! I've had it with this ghost fly! I wish I were a ghost so I could punch him with my ghost fist! What? [looks at Finn crawling on the ceiling] Finn... [to BMO] All right. But first you got to give me some unfinished business so I can come back as a ghost. Okay. What do you call a bear that only attacks guys named Paul? [choking] [becomes pale and falls backwards] Okay. Five minutes. Whoa. Is this some kind of low-level dead world? That's a bummer. Aah! Aah! Oh, stuff! Aah! Ohh! Ohh! Get away! [throws a ghost cat at the ghost fly] Aah! You killed it! Aah! Aah! Aah! Get away! [screams] [screams] That's right. You never finished the soup. That's your unfinished business! And now that you've finished it, you get to ascend to a glorious, new peaceful realm. [in awe] Ahhh. Bam! [slaps the fly to the floor, making it disappear in a cloud of smoke] Shouldn't have tried to kill me, son! [blows at smoke] Yes! [starts ascending and glowing] What's happening? Oh, BMO must be bringing me back! Yes! Yeah, BMO! Mm. BMO? Good job, BMO! You brought me back. Mm, oh boy. Blech! None! I don't wanna talk about it. Probably an owl. [Takes a bite of his hot dog] Mm... Mm, mm... [Spits out his food] A ghost!! Are you haunting us? Oh, okay. Oh. Well, let's hear more about that, honey. Whoa, step back, nephew. We don't know she was moidered! Whoa. Your neighborhood is... uh... very peaceful. [Awkwardly] Right, right. Awww... Whoa. Smooth. [To Ghost Princess and Clarence, running off with Finn] You stay, and eat cheese puffs! Yeah, no wonder this is where the ne'er-do-wells go when they deezy. I got a feelin' these ghosts are gonna be harder to shake than Boilbee. Cool, man. Hey, can I be bad cop now? What's it say? Hey, man, take it easy. Alright. Cool off, bad cop! [Pulls Finn back] This ghost ain't home, man! He's not worth it, man. What? I think this place is abandoned, man. Phew! Thanks, Clarence! Nice! Look on the bright side, guy! We looted all this sweet grave booty! Ka-ching! [Drops a variety of treasures] Oops... I didn't know it was wrong. What?! All of it?! What's that? What is it, dude?? Some donkus skee-bopped Ghost Princess!! Whoa, wait a minute. Say that again! I know you, man! From the Squeez-E-Mart! Congratulations, you kids! Yeah. Gimme one a' them cheesy dogs, man. [Moving his tongue left] Wah-vah. [Moving his tongue right] Vah. Hey, man, it's Couples Only Movie Night tonight. Who are you bringin'? I'm bringing my girlfriend, dude. It's couples night! You gotta bring someone you can smooch. Don't have to smooch. You just have to bring someone you can smooch. It's, like, the rules. Put the blanket down. [Pats the ground beside him.] Have a seat. I want to explain some "things" to you about couples. You all square? Who you gonna call? Yes she does! We just need to help her realize that she wants to go to the movies with you. [Takes out cell phone.] I'm calling Marceline. [Begins to call Marceline.] Look, man, I've been learning a lot about vampires lately. I realized my fear was based on ignorance! Hey, hey, Marceline. Got a favor to ask, Babe. We've gotta make Princess Bubblegum jealous, so she'll go to the movies with Finn. [Marceline sneaks out from a pile of dirty clothes behind Okay, so here's the plan. [Points at Finn] You start saying things and [Points at Marceline] you start laughing waaay loud. And then Bubblegum... [Camera pans up to Princess Bubblegum through the window above them.] will get jealous of you [Points at Marceline]. Which will awaken her Finn love! You start us off. That was great! Now, we begin Phase 2! It's so powerful! Wait here! Hehehe... [Stretches away.] Whoa, where you going, man? Check it out! It's a lute-suit! Girls love it! Trust me. It's a lute-suit! And Finn looks adorable in it! What she talking about, Finn? Her idea?! What's wrong with my idea? [Marceline flicks her tongue at Ridi—Ridiculous? What? Can you believe this girl, Finn? Huh? Can ya? Well, fine! You can just give it back then! Good luck getting to that movie without my help! Ruff. [Stretches away.] Hey, man, I've been looking for you. Sorry for acting like a dweeb before. Want some leftover spaghetti? 'Bout time! I didn't really say all that. [Mumbles something and hides behind couch.] Yeah, first day of school can be real tough. We wouldn't want Sweet P freaking out or awakening any latent evil spirits within himself! [Cautious laughter] [to Finn] You think he's still secretly evil, that he's still all "Lich-y" in there? I don't know, Finn, he just seems so... sweet! [Sweet P hugs his parents back.] [to Finn] So far so good. [They both gasp as they see a squirrel whose head is stuck in a glass jar.] Wait, Finn. Let's just see how this plays out. Daww! Bye. [Waves] What'ya building? Oh, rad! Look. It's just my size. [Role-playing] Hey, get away from my fort, you big stinky monster! Yeah, me too. Whoa, whoa! And I'm Princess Bubblegum, are you okay? Aw, you should go to bed. Okay. C'mon, Goliad. Uhm... Uhh... Ah, nah, these kids ain't nothin'! Kids groove doozyploon! Check this out. Hey, there kids, who wants to play-- Uhh, easy now children. Easy- Listen up, you kids better stop donkin' around! You're gonna mess up Goliad!

Uh, you know, Finn... maybe this isn't such a good idea, actually. C'mon, Goliad. Let's go see Princess Bubblegum. Goliad's got mind control powers! [Thinking] Ugh, eyeball... Just tuck that eyeball back in its hole. Wow, man, so, like... I guess they're so evenly matched that it's a stale— [Spits out Chet] It's a stale— [spits out another two candy people] Deal. Aaah... Hello? [Wincing in disgust] Ooh! It's nice of you to wanna be our secretary... but we don't need one. Alright, LSP. Come inside.  'Sup, LSP? Yup. Heh heh heh! "Ker-ploop." We gotta bust through this wall! Sometimes, after an adventure, he likes to sit out there and think. [Goes upstairs] LSP, YOU'RE WEARING GARBAGE FOR CLOTHES!!!! [sitting on a reclining beach chair with a magazine over his face] Don't listen to him, BMO. I beat the wizard, so I'm making Finn dig the hole, even though I could do it in like two seconds. Heh, heh, heh. I'll tell you what I'd do. I'd use that cannon and imagine a hole. I'm tired of your wisdom, BMO! [gets up, walks toward wand] Now watch and learn! Yeah, okay, my name's Nope, my brain's my hands! Whoops! Looks like I was thinking about a sandwich. [muffled] Enjoy your labor! Heh, heh, heh. Ha ha! Yeah, he knows how to get things started. It's probably a computel gleetch. Now comes some real trouble! It's Bouncy Bee! He's gonna get that sun, man! [chuckles] Yeah, that was cool. Oh, oh, you missed a coin, dude, go back! Hunny Bunny! Man, you are hot tonight! Think you can do it this time? Can you beat Sleepy Sam?! Remember use a combo move! Spin, down, up, left, faster, dude! Right, left, down! BMO, is there a way for us to get in the game for real? ...Finn? ...oh, right! Heh heh. Good night, BMO. [BMO looks at them suspiciously] Time for bed! [ Look! There's the sunshine we gotta protect! [points to the sun in the video game] And there's a hole we're supposed to go down! [points to a cave] And there's you...doing whatever you're doing. [points to Finn] Mmm. That sunshine feels good. Feels good all over! [laughs] Beep boop! Beep boop! ♫ In a game, I can be who I virtually am. ♫ [sniffs] Hey, what stinks? [sniffs] Smells like... Jumpin' over this pit is easy, remember? We could do this backwards with our eyes closed! [jumps backwards with eyes closed and falls into pit] Ahh! I'm burning! Haha. What, man? Check it out! Extra lives! [laughs and jumps into lava pit] Ow! It burns! Ow! Haha! [sings along with jingle] ...that makes me just want to sit here and feel bad. Ow! Whew! That was pretty intense, dude! Yeah! [High-fives Finn] What's that sound? Whoa! Easy-peasy, livin' greasy! No! [ Finn's dead! Finn! No! [ Oh, Finn! You're alive! [ Oh my gosh. Let's never die again! There's nothing more precious than a life! Ooh, dude, look. Coins! Oh man, oh man! [ No! Let's get outta here, Finn! Look, Finn. The most important thing to remember is that I still have one giant coin. Hey, that's him right there! [ Okay! Let's get outta here, man! We're gonna die! Wait, dude! The bomba! Wait, dude. [ What if I...? [ [still holding on] But we need the bomba! Finn! Yeah, man. And I got my coin! [looks at coin] What?! A penny?! [BMO starts grunting.] BMO! [Finn and Aw man, don't kill us! We don't have extra lives! We'll save you, BMO! Finn, go! Listen! You got this, man! I know you- [ Woohoo! [ BMO! Yeah, yeah! We were only joking! How'd it go? Didn't he try to kill you with monsters made out of your own baby teeth? [Excitedly] Do I? [He climbs onto Finn's head and shape-shifts to look like Finn's hat.] This is cute, right? How so? You're a beautiful flower and I love to watch you grow. [Whispering to Finn] Cuteness offensive. [He clicks his tongue again.] [Retracting back over Finn's face] Bark! Bark, bark, bark, bark! Bark, bark, baraaaah! So then I made him do a diaper baby dance! [Laughs] Whoo-hoo! [Shaking himself off.] Blblblblbl! Man, I almost thought that was something really serious. [off screen] Aaaah! [comes out of bushes covering his ears] Aaaaah! [rolls on ground] Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl! [gets up and knocks the viola out of Finn's hands] Uh! That sounded horrible, man! [picks up viola] Exactly! [starts tuning viola] Oh, wait up. I gotta finish tuning my viola. [putting his foot in the print] Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo! Wait, you were gonna wee-wee if I was the Gut Grinder? [loudly] Then I am the Gut Grinder! I'm just kiddin', everybody. I'm not the Gut Grinder. I'm... [shrinks back to normal size] Hey, I'm not cute! Huh? Oh, heheh. [closes his eyes, purrs, drools] What?! [getting a belly rub] Oh... heheh. What? No! [Finn grabs him and drags him away] Noooo... [still being dragged by Finn] Bye, Soft Village. Hey Finn, my feet fit these prints pretty well. Hm, what if I really am the Gut Grinder? [laughs nervously] [laugh] That is true. Check this out. [shrinks his feet to fit Finn's prints and walks in them; says mockingly] I'm Finn the Human and I stink at viola! There's a lot of interesting smells in poop. [emerging from behind a building] Wait, what happened? [laughs nervously] Th-that's ridiculous. Oh yeah. [shrinks down, starts dancing] Ooh ooh ooh. [sings] I am not... the Gut Grinder. Ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh. Hey! Y'all are the ones who are cute. I'm hot. Aaah! I'm not cute! I'm--mnh, [closes eyes] ooh. [getting belly rubbed] Ruff, ruff, grrrr... [continues making dog sounds] Wha--? [getting up] Where am I? [following Finn] I'm not cute. I'll mess you up. Finn...? What if I am the Gut Grinder? What if I'm, like, stealing gold in my sleep? Wha--? Yo, Finn, that is creepy, man. Well, when do you sleep? Well, there's gotta be a time when you're not watchin' me... that--that I--that I might be stealin' gold unconsciously! [worried moan] I love it! [kisses lump, hides his face by moving it to his chest] Launch in 3, 2, 1! [jumps toward Spiky Village] [moving lump] I'm Groucho! [quietly] Wha--? [looking at photo] Finn, it's me! Yeah, I-I know you think it does, Finn--but this is different. I'm scared, Finn. [starts shaking nervously] No, Finn... I belong behind bars. Look at the evidence--I really am the Gut Grinder. Then... why am I in jail? Only Gut Grinders go to jail. Huh? Grrrr... not cute. [thinking] Am I the Gut Grinder? [looks through bars at Gut Grinder stepping on Finn] All the clues fit! [sees gold tooth] I must be the Gut Grinder! [as Gut Grinder, aloud] And I want GOLD! [as Gut Grinder] Grrrr! I'm not [as Gut Grinder] Rawr! Now give me that tooth! [snatches tooth, tosses it into his mouth, and laughs while walking away] [as Gut Grinder] Huh? [comes back] Ah, stay away from my viola! [as Gut Grinder] I also remember that you stink hard at playing it. And dookie is radical, man! I don't care what anyone says. [shakes head; normal voice] Wha--huh? What? Where am I? Finn, is that you? Whoo! [shrinks to normal size] I guess I went nuts. [burps up tooth, laughs] It's good to have you pat my back. [pushes Finn away] Cut it out! Ow! Hey! Don't touch us! OWWWW! [Looks at Finn and sighs, then answers the ringing phone.] Hello. What's shakin'? Ehh, I dunno. Finn's got rat germs all through his body. Brave little soldier, up on muffin hill. Huh! Woo! Ehh, that made my teeth hurt. My neck sort of hurts. Yeah, I could go for some blood. [gasps] Yeah, what if we turn evil? I'll hafta start wearing cologne. Sorry, bro. [While Finn and We're invisible! [He punches Finn in the stomach.] Hey. Then how come we can see each other? Wow! LSP's a hobo! She must recognize our voices. Weeeee! Geez, we really scared her. Ohhh! We wanna fly! Peace. I think they're testing our vampire abilities. Yeah. Yeah! [Prevaricating] No... I'm not... Dude, what?! What're you doing, man? EEH! [Grabs onto Finn] Rrrr... HEY! AAAH! [Runs to Finn's side] I wanna help you outta this, man, but... she scares the filling out of my doughnut. Let's just leave. FINN! [Marceline cackles as they fly into the air.] Don't worry, dude! I'll figure something out!! [To himself] Rrr... Don't you worry, Finn. I'll get you outta there. I've got a perfect plan! [Marceline laughs. She notices [To himself] Don't worry, dude. I'm comin' to help you. YAAAAH!! [Charges out of bushes with a stake towards Marceline] [To himself] Sorry, Finn. [To himself] Oh, no! My buddy is totally under her vampire spell! [Yelling out] Die, unholy thing! [Throws garlic at her] I'm stakin' that vampire and settin' you free, no matter how terrified I am! She's still controlling your mind with evil! Now, back off and let me vanquish her from existence! [Sighs deeply] I love you, brother. YAAAH! [Attacks Finn, forcing him to the ground] What are you even talkin' about, dude?! MARCELINE! [ I did?! I did! Yeah! [singing] I saved my bro from a scum-sucking vampire!! [Runs away and laughs triumphantly.] You want some more eggs, BMO? [Gives BMO more eggs] How 'bout you, Finny? Need a refill? I don't know if stomachs work like that, dude. Can't argue with that! [Relaxes] Ahh... [Answering] Hello? Lady, it's gonna be fine. Mm-hmm. Alright, I love you, too. Bye. [Hangs up] Yeah, man. She's worried about introducing me to her parents at lunch today. She thinks they're gonna freak out. No way! That's our treasure! Wait. I've got it, dude! I'll invite them over early, smooth them over using my personality, and we'll all be best friends before Lady gets here so she doesn't have to feel nervous! It's perfect! I'll just send them a quick Prism-gram. [Begins writing] Mm-hmm. [He finishes and sends the message. The reply comes within seconds.] Hold on. It's still converting the light waves into brain waves. [The crystal shoots a beam into his head.] Ahh... They're into it, dude! Well... she didn't really say, but it might have somethin' to do with the Rainicorn-Dog Wars. Horrifying wars. For thousands of years, rainicorns battled dogs over territory in the Crystal Dimension... but Lady and I are cool. ...Nah. That could never happen. AAAH! I'M A MORON! I'm ready to hear your plan, homie. You know, I thought painting ourselves rainbow-color using condiments and stuff from the fridge so we could pretend to be rainicorns was a good idea when you pitched it to me five minutes ago, but now I'm not so sure, man. [Worried] No, no, no, new plan. First, we're gonna clean this place up, and then— [Doorbell rings] Huh?! AAAAH... [To Finn] LET'S HIDE AND BURN THE HOUSE DOWN! 안녕하세요. ("Hello.") Uh-huh. Y-yeeeaaah... [Opens door] I can explain!! I can explain!! You think I'm a rainicorn? Uh, well, hey! Come on in! It's awesome to finally meet you both! Uh... that's um... Uh... y-yes! [To Finn] Get outta here, goblin! Go fetch us some rainicorn snacks! [Whispering] Come on, homie, help me! Uh... please, c-come upstairs. My goblin will bring us snacks in a moment. Well, ask me whatever you like, Ethel, Bob! Well... he's actually a human. Uh... No problem, Bob! Uh, s-say it again? Ohhhh! [Laughs] Cablatapuamba—[Blows raspberry]! I thought you said "Kabloderaga—[Blows raspberry]"! [Chuckles] Ah, man, I love gettin' down and dirty with some Cablatapuamba—[Blows raspberry]! Ha! Y'all should go first, though. I... [To himself] Finn! [Whispering to him] Dude! I have to show Lady's parents that I have rainbow powers! I need homie help! You're the best, homie. Haha! [He steps back and Finn breathes in and holds his breath, then gives a thumbs-up.] Cablatapuamba—[Blows raspberry]! Whoo! Oh, yeah! [Finn is breathing heavily on the floor.] Finn? I, uh... Oh. Um... let's do it! [Whispering to Finn] I'm sorry. [To the parents] Yo, my bad! I'll get 'im! [ I know, I know, I'm sorry. But they really like me. Your plan is working perfectly! Look, Finn, you know I got yo back fo'-eva', but right now, you're the only one who can help me. Come on, homie. [He smiles at Finn who is still making an angry face.] Homies help homies. [Finn smiles.] [Ethel and Bob enter laughing.] Hey, guys. You ready to get this game goin' again? Wohhh, no. You're my guests. Let me take care of you. [Whispering to Finn] Homie... help me cook something, please. Thanks, Finn. [To Ethel and Bob] Okay. Don't worry about a thing. Finn'll make a great lunch. He's a little raw, but he's got great taste. [Panicking] Man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.... Come on, stop it, guys! Come on, y'all, I said stop! [Growls angrily then grows huge] NOW, THAT'S ENOUGH!!! Nobody's eating Finn!! He's not my butler, and he's not food! Finn is my friend! [Ethel and Bob gasp.] I'm sorry I let the lies get so far outta hand. I just got so scared of losing Lady! [To himself] But if they hate me, so be it. No more lies. [Retracts to his default form] Yeah, I just... [Groans] Look, I'm sorry about everything. I was— Uh... uh... [Gasps] Lady?! She said she worried that they'd freak out... 'cause her parents are bananas for dogs! Yeah! She says a dog saved her dad in the war! So... this isn't human? Ew... Soy? [Eats some and smiles] FINN, YOU'RE DELICIOUS! Then hold my hand, dude! [Finn does so.] Whoooop! Heh heh heh. [They jump off the giant.] How's the Mini Queen? [Sniffs] Mini Queen must've stepped in somethin' funky. [Sniffs] No... It's not tiny feet I'm smelling! This way! [He sniffs the ground and follows a scent. The scent leads him to a sword.] Whoa! [In awe] Do you know whose sword this is?! This is the sword of Billy! Oh, yeah! Hahaha! He fought a bear! [Whispering] I know, I know! Be cool!! I wanna be the dog version of you! Heh. Yeah. I-I'm a little paunchy... but I could do some sit-ups! Heh. See, that's where you're wrong... 'cuz watch! [He tries to catch his tail, of course to no avail.] Ah... ah... [Scared, yet smiling] Heh... I'm gonna pass out... [Falls backward] What other way is there? Me, too! I love you, Billy! I got a secret crush on you, Billy! Relax. It'll be easy not to beat up on monsters and still help people. Oh... [Straightforward] Sorry. We don't beat stuff up anymore. I could teach 'im how to not be such a spaz. Say no more. [Walking away, pulling Finn with him] Come on, Finn. To make you somethin' to eat! Trust me. This is a way better way to help 'im. [Yelling out] Gruel! Get your free gruel! Yeah, we're really helpin' people! Dude! You're alive! [Deliberate] Dude. Gruel. Dude... how much of that potion did you use? [To Finn] What does "cobble" mean, anyway? [To Finn] Did you fix that shoe with a magic nail? Cool! Dude, suckin' at somethin' is the first step towards bein' sorta good at somethin'. You and I are like little baby Billys right now, and we're "sucking" on our first bottle of nonviolent milk! Whoa, what?! [Whistles] [To Finn] You up for some serious plastic surgery? Dude, did you use a magic nail again? ....Yeah...? Not if we run away, Finn! We'll have to live in halfway homes and be cannibals! We'll survive! Then I'll moan with ya, buddy. [Moaning] Yoooouuu'rrre weeeelcooome... [To Finn] Aw, man, this grass-bag again?? [Heroically] HEY, EVIL-DOER! [Weakly] Um... could you keep your evil-doing quiet? Finn is dealing with some heavy stuff over here. Wait, didn't she say not to take advice from old peo— Cha!! And we've got exciting news! She's right here. [Turns around, revealing her] You saved 'er. We're his heroes!! Ha! Haha! I love you, Billy!! Man, who cares if it's honey? You stink anyways. Oh, snaps! Oh, dang! Oh, nah, I'm just trying to show you how many weeks ya got. Awesome. [Finn and Dude, you see my masterpiece coming together, right? [ Well, put some meat in there! That's Meat Man's meat. I don't know. I can't read his mind. [yells] No! It's wasted, man. [while dreaming] Rainicorn, don't eat 'im. [ [while dreaming] Meat Man. Meat Man, I'm sorry, Meat Man, I didn't mean it, man. [ Hey, Finn, you awake yet? I had a dream about Meat Man. I think I'm gonna stop eating Meat Man. [ Good job. Good job, the Ice King. C'mon, man, let's get outta here! Uh, I think so. Uh, hey, guys? I don't think this ice dome is gonna last long. Hey, I'll kill you! No way, man! [ Yeah! Uh-huh. I found it at the dump and then buried it without lookin' inside. Whoa! And I found it? Heh-heh-heh. Let's have a secret screening! I'll make some fliers for it! There. Now nobody will bother us. This is so exciting! [Talking over tape] Dude... what are we watchin'? Can we fast-forward? What?!? Hey, pause it, BMO. Okay... Well, why don't I make us some snacks? So I don't have to watch... this... [Chuckles and munches snack] You're Gunther. [Chuckles with Finn] What? Oh, but I was so clear in my flier! Wait! Wait! You guys are checking too loud! Cool. [Sighs tiredly] Fast-forward, BMO. I'm gonna take a nap... Maybe he's talkin' in secret code. Well, how do we decode the secrets? Well, who do we call? [Taking phone] Yeah, they're really stupid, but, y'know... Maybe they're encoded or whateva. [Groaning] Ohh... ...AAAAAAAAAaaa [singing] aaaloutte, gentille Alouette, Alouette, je te plumerai. Je te plumerai la tête! Je te plumerai la tête! Alouette, [Flopping lips with fingers] je te plumerai! Yeah, it's kinda chilly in here. This is so fascinating... Yeeeesh..... Don't worry, BMO! Drrr-AMA bomb!! It's from me, too. [Taking skunk] Uh... thanks. Uh... (in real word) I don't know, Shelby. I think it's too dark in there! Pull 'im up, pull 'im up! Finn, you gotta go back to sleep! Cosmic owl dreams are important always! You gotta Go Back and find them again. Get back in there! It's too important! You don't got time on my class ring, or bets with Shelby, or Stomach fishing! Oop! (shushes Finn) Alright let's do it! (Finn arrives back in his dream) This guy's really working on me. Hey, PB, what's the plan? We pledged our allegiance to you. Mm. Hey, is it me, or is getting purpler out here? Getting close? Should we evacuate or... Starch? Shouldn't we try and calm them down? King of Ooo! King of Ooo? Wait, are you saying "King of Ooo"? I thought it was "kinkoff goo." Hey. You hear that? King of Ooo! What the — Hey! [Gasps] [Straining] [Chuckles] Aaaaah! [Still terrified] The Princess of the Fire Kingdom? I was trying to help you get over your Princess Bubblegum sad times by hooking you two up. But she's evil, man! Dirty? [Checks gums] Oh. No, really man! Her dad said she was evil! Hmmm.. Eeeeeeeeehhh, ok. You sure you're not into any other princesses? What about Wildberry Princess? She's small and plump. You could sleep on her like a pillow. Could be nice. Guy drops one piece of ham in the snow and he never hears the end of it! Snap out of it! She's burning cute little flowers! Finn! Hold on! [Turns into a giant and uses his "buns" to put out the fire on the tree] Eaoww.. Toasty buns. [Runs off while carrying Finn as they reach the end of the forest] She's headed for Goblin Kingdom! We need to defeat this fiery she-beast! Finn, what's more important? Your love for that screwball dame, or being a hero and savin' the lives of innocent goblin folks? Alright, c'mon! Let's go build fire-proof suits. Dude, slow down or your fire suit will be junk. [Sees a bag of bread] Ooh. Is bags of old bread fire-proof? [Slightly shoves the bag, showing Neptr.] [Whispers to Finn] Oh, plops, we forgot about the game. DUUUUDE! I feel like I can touch the heavens! [Whispers] And sock angels! [Gasp] I'll put it out! [ Oh... [Hovers near the fire.] I need your help Finn! This one's too big! [Kicks fire] Mmm! [Smiles and gets another scoop.] FINN! [Stretches up.] Oh my Glob, man. Everyone's dead, man! They're all burned. There's barbecued bods EVERYWHERE! Hah. I'm just kidding. I saved 'em. Everyone's fine, see? So. How'd everything go with Flame Princess? Whoa! How did it feel? Then let's burn its butt down to the root rubbin's. [The duo walks forward.] Finn, I can feel a bunch of eyeballs peepin' us from the woods. Dude! The tree's about to 'splode its evil juice all over! Is he crushin' you, man?! Oh...! [Turns and talks to tree] When you see the wicker devil in tree afterlife, tell 'im Hey, buddy, you okay? Wha..,? Hmmmm... Dude, why're you so huggy? Hmm... [Feels Finn's forehead] You've got a fever, man. I think you need a good night's sleep. You feelin' better today? Good. Hey, you think we have enough candy litter? [Eats some of it] Litter for lunch! Mmm! Yeah, buddy, but you were pretty huggy last night... buddy. I'm just sayin' you were really clingy. No. I have a theory, ...but I don't like it. Your questionable behavior started about an hour or so after you got hugged by that wolf man, right? Well, I've been thinkin' that maybe that wolf man wasn't what he seemed. Maybe he was some sort of hug wolf. Yeah, here it is. [Reading book] "Hug wolves—a subset of wolf men which roam the countryside with a fervid hug lust. Every night, hug wolves must go out and hug people to satisfy their insatiable craving for hugs. To become a hug wolf, one must be hugged by an alpha hug wolf on the night of a full moon."! Yes. So you must be a beta hug wolf. A lower-level creature. Lemme, um... read the book a little more. Says there's no known cure. No hugs!! What's wrong, BMO? Hmm. Well, that plant's not gonna protect you. [BMO stops shielding himself in disbelief] You can get this under control, buddy. ARE YOU READY TO OVERCOME THIS THING?? I said... ARE YOU READY TO OVERCOME THIS THING?? I'm tryin'a' getcha to shout. Never mind. Now. I want you to think about hugging a cactus. How would that feel? Good, good, you're doin' great! No, you can't hug anything. Oh, no, the hug lust is already takin' over your brain! Finn... say something to reassure me. BMO! Strobe light mode! [BMO activates his strobe lights.] Back, beast! Finn? Finn? You hugged... everyone. Candy People, let's make sure that Alpha Hug Wolf pays for what he's done!! Cinnamon Bun, you watch over Finn! Let's go, boys!! I smell someone bein' hugged right now! [Spots ‎Alpha Hug Wolf hugging an antelope.] That hug be your last, demon! No huggies! [‎Alpha Hug Wolf lands in front of This is the biggest hug that's ever existed! [Runs up to her] Can I get a hug? AAAH—! Yeah, dude, but it's getting pretty late. We might got to catch him tomorrow. No looking. [Finn close the eyes and take the sword, Finn Sword shake your head] I bet you can't do that behind your back. What a sword trick. Oh, oh! I bet you can't do that and freestyle some bars. Bad biscuits make the baker broke, bro. Dinner roll! Oh... You got 'im. [Talking like Batman] Your constant harassment of the female gender makes me sick. What is goin' on in there?! Ready? [Sounds of concentration] [Then farts] [Seals Squeez-E-Mart bag like a balloon.] [Gasps] [Farts] Just go back to the Fire Kingdom and get 'em. Problem solved. That ain't me. Flambo! [Whispers to Finn] For a second, I thought the princess was farting. [Stretches his left arm to hold onto something with Finn holding onto his back, sneaking pass the Flame Guards.] [Sniffing the candles] [Whispers] They smell like an old lady's bathroom. [Whispers in reply] I said that as a compliment. Like, it reminds me of grandma. I love my grandma. Whoa! [Sniffs] [Drops the candle] Right, right. [Opens the door] [Gasps] Now what? The kind we are looking for. Dude, the voice [Opens the air vent] [Uses his stretchy powers to get there and pulls Finn up.] [Then closes the air vent] [Whispers] This way! [Drags self] [Whispers] To the left [Checking out] [Whispers] I don't think it's them. [Falls] Whooaaa. [Whispers in response] I'm okay. I think I hear that hissing voice down this way! Whoops. Tell me next time, I can't think in the future. [Whispers] Vent ahead.[And looks outside] [Whispers] No untied shoe. [whispers] Vent [Points right finger to Jalapeño pepper] You baffoon! Where's your partner with the untied shoe? [Looks at the snake] Hmmmm. Sufferin'... ...succotash. [Picks up a table with food on it] [Makes a distance with Finn] I have an idea. We'll go on stage, act like two conspirators, you will have one shoe untied, I'll talk with a hiss voice, we'll talk about how we want to kill the king, as we do these, we'll study the faces of the audience, a move of guilty reactions. Thanks! It's an original idea, by me. Hey co-conspirator! Shhhhhh sssssomebody might here our evil plot. Psst, the audience. You think that's one of them. Water, man. Enough of it to put out the King's fire. Whoa, what!? [Picks the scented candles and lights them with Flame Princess's hair] [Then puts them on her bedside table] You gonna do the thing again?! Nice. [Panting] Man... [Panting] Dancin' is rough! Hey, man. I'm Uh, Finn? I think that bear is followin' us home. I dunno, Finn. This guy seems kinda weird. [Unsure] Mmmmm... Eh, okay. Heh-heh. Um... Yeah, okay. [Grabs a broom and starts sweeping] Sweepy-sweepy-sweepy. Sweep sweep sweep. Sweepin'! [Annoyed] Mmmmmm... This guy just busted me up my chops, Finn! Mmmm... Yeah, I guess. Well, anyway, it's gettin' pretty late. Probably time for everyone to go back home to their own houses. Shhh. Come with me. Ya gotta see somethin'. This bear's wiggy, Finn. It's wearing your clothes and dancin' around all crazy. What?! No—Just—! ... Rrrr! [Pulls Finn out of bed] Aw, man! [Finn sighs.] Oh, ya gotta believe me, Finn. I swear, he was, like, all wigged-out, was dancin'... [Desperate noise] [Pleasantly surprised] Oh. No. [Chuckles] I guess not. Yeah, okay. [Chuckles] You're not even a little weirded out by this? Yeah, I get it. You don't need to tell me that every time you make Finn Cakes. Hey, what are you doin'?! [The bear begins eating the cakes.] Why, you little...! Tryin' to set me up, eh? You think you're so smart, but this time, I'm ready. [Pulls out video camera, records bear, and laughs] Uh, nope. The bear did it, and I've got proof. I taped the whole thing. Ju— What?! No, man, he was tryin' to frame me, Finn! He's tryin' to steal your identity! Why can't you grok that?! Ohh, fine, then that's just great. Then you and M.C. Cool Friend can go stink it up together at your stupid cool Finn party all by yourself, cause I'm not going! What? Your party, man. Tonight? In the woods? Huh?! Well, who did, then?! [Finn gasps.] ...I knew it. See, dude? He's not just jackin' your style. He's jackin' your whole you! Jackin' yo you up! He got in close and used you. Now he's feedin' nuts to your ex-girlfriend! He's trying to replace you, and he's already got everyone convinced he's you! He didn't really like you. [Whispering] He used you. Wait up, guy! Me, too. I guess he's got a heart of gold after all. [Whispering] Finn, are you nuts?! We can't give that book away! It's, like, crazy-important! That's really cool, PB! Isn't it cool, Finn? It's letting up. Hey, Finn, come on, let's go do something. [Whispers] BMO, put on a game. Oh, Finn.... Uncle Finn, I'm going out for a quick.... walk in the woods. BMO, you look after him with your camera-eyes. Ok, good. Woman! I'll save you, wash tub princess! You're safe now, Miss... Flambo?! I did think that. [Throws the wash tub] Hey.... You're pretty plugged-in, Flambo. Do you know any princesses Finn's age? She's from Fire Kingdom? I think I'll die if I go in there. Ow... [Angered grunt] BMO-cam on. Ugh... Hang in there, buddy. [Gasps] [ Could have told me this sooner. Good morrow, Majesty! [Exclaims] I am Sir [Terrified] Uhk-uhg... I come as an envoy of Prince Finn. Yeah and he's the same age as your daughter. [Points left hand at Flame Princess.] Umm.... Oh, Prince Finn is AWESOME! [Smiles] A gift?! Sire, Prince Finn sent, uh... three gifts! [Shows to hands how many gifts he brought and claps.] The first gift is [looks inside the backpack] um-um-um this water bottle. Uh, Prince Finn hated him too. For your second gift, a, uh... hmmmm oh! [ No, wait! Uh-um, [Exclaims] Prince Finn is here! [Stretches his stomach to look like Finn.] He's riiight... here! [Sounds of concentration] Dude, don't cry. She's too old for you. Come on! Flame Princess seems into you. Ouw, Finn! [Fake Finn strangles [Choking] Fiiiinn. [Then plays dead and inhales] [Whispers] Yeah! Whaaaat?! [Whispers] She seems normal. [Panting] Finn! I really messed up. Finn, buddy, you gotta help me. I made a mistake.

This'll pretty much wreck up your whole life, so think about it. Okay...I'm gonna lower you some more...probably gonna cook up your brain. [thinking to himself] Dang, he's flippin' crazy! This isn't gonna do anything, he's never gonna give up! You're right, man. My bruises are hickeys from the Universe. And I should just accept that. Yeah, in my face. Dangit, Finn.

[laughs uncontrollably] Nah, I think I was just gonna keep being a brick for a while. Finn, ever since I was little, I wanted to see what it's like to be a brick in a brick shack when the brick shack falls down. And this shack is gonna fall down. Just look at it. Like sandcastles in the sun, baby. [laughs] You're too young; you wouldn't understand. What? No, man, bricks don't stay in touch! Aww. You tell that little goofball I said hi. Oh. Really? So soon? [laughs] Yeah. Bye! Okay, back to being a brick. [beat] I'm so bored. [blows raspberry] Ooh, I'm starting to get a little tippy in my teacups. [quietly] A bunny! Looks like our long-eared friend is on to something. Bunnies love to dig. He's making a supreme effort, and I think I can guess why. That's right. A carrot, grown out here free and wild, probably the result of a seed pooped out by a passing bird. But what's this? A mysterious rustling in the bush. Could mean trouble. Mr. Bunny seems to think so. His sensitive whiskers quiver at the hint of imminent danger. Unfortunately for Mr. Bunny, this is what nature is all about. It's a male deer. Not a threat to Mr. Bunny in the predatory sense, but still above him in the food chain. Mr. Bunny, wishing to avoid an encounter, hops away to safety. Wow, deers are jerks. What?! Arrrrrgh! No! I had no idea. Hi, BMO. No. It's not about the bunny! The bunny is incidental to the brick experiment. Forget about the bunny. Finn? Are you still there? Finn? BMO? Mr. Bunny retreats to its warren. Its homemade comfort is some consolation to help pass the hungry night. Twilight falls on the peaceful forest, a twilight unaware of the struggles it both soothes and conceals. The crickets begin to stir, rehearsing their musical rhapsodies. In the distance, flashes of heat lightning illuminate a purple summer sky. Even angry deer, at last, must come to rest. And so it is with our erstwhile antagonist, who has disappeared into a stand of trees, perhaps to dream of tomorrow's pointless battles. Oh, my Gob, it's a crazy storm! This might be it! This weather might knock the whole thing down! [laughs, then stops and looks at the rabbit] If a definition of bravery exists, then this must be it. A lone bunny, facing off against the elements, ineffectually pushing around some twigs with his pink bunny nose, a symbolic gesture, perhaps, but sometimes that's all we have. The wind is beginning to pick up. It's becoming clear that Mother Nature has not just knocked on the door, she has come in, sat down, and poured herself a drink. Mr. Bunny has no friends, no family, no loved ones of any kind. The wind is really picking up now. Small puddles gathering around the entrance to Mr. Bunny's cozy home are beginning to grow in size and connect with one another. It won't be long now. But what's this?! Looks like this unflagging little hero of a bunny will have some help, though! A family of friendly beavers appears to have taken up the cause. Often called nature's architects, these intrepid mammals are sparing no effort to shore up the endangered burrow. Here's an unusual sight. It's a Sea Lard! You'd expect to see a few mudscamps out in weather like this, but here we have a rare treat indeed. This little beauty is pretty far outside of her natural habitat, but I've heard it said by wise old salts schooled in ancient maritime lore that storms will sometimes blow them off course to a remarkable degree. Looks like we've got some pretty good evidence tonight. Yes, sir, sometimes those old sailors know what they're talking about. It's a triumph of experience versus the secondhand verities of musty academic tomes. This feisty Sea Lard is pitchin' right in to save the rabbit hole, belying its slothful reputation. She uses her prodigious swiveling behind to increase the size of the hole, while the beavers continue to reinforce the sides with straw and stick. Times like these, supposed cruelty and indifference of the natural world, all too often its most salient feature, pale before the nobler instincts of even our most humble kin. In the morning light, few signs remain of the summer storm that battered this idyllic glen. The beavers are finished with their work and are heading home. The Sea Lard looks like she's gonna wander the woods for a while. Maybe she'll find her way back to the ocean and write a novel about her experiences. Mr. Bunny is exhausted but can rest easy knowing that his home is secure. But alas, the bunny's rest is short-lived. The deer is back. The deer, perhaps confused by the antler-like appearance of Mr. Bunny's protective dam, is now testing the situation. The bunny is unsure of where this is going. And with a single smash from the deer's powerful front hooves, the bunny's home is under attack! Mr. Bunny has hopped to safety and can only watch as the deer continues its relentless rampage on the only home he knows. A couple more mighty smashes, and the dam—the dam has been breached! Water is now flooding in! The deer continues its attack! This deer's misplaced rage, combined with its size and weight, is more than enough to bring down the weakened walls, which are now starting to give, aided by the unforgiving weigh from the tree above. Even Mr. Deer, in his blind fury, seems to sense what's about to happen as he steps to one side! It's over. The warren has been destroyed. An injustice of astronomical levels. Words fail me. Actually, he doesn't seem that upset. He's on his feet, checking out his new surroundings—even the deer is impressed! As if confused by the events, he performs a comical double-take and retreats into the forest. Ladies and gentlemen, this bunny is indomitable! [laughs] This bunny has the right attitude. Who cares about being a brick in a wall of a fallen-down shack? There's something bigger than that, and the bunny has answers. [stretches out of wall] Teach me, Mr. B! Aw. Hey, Finn. That sounds good. [ Charlie, [Charlie yawns] T.V., [T.V. rolls over from being so round] Viola, [legs wobble] Kim Kil Whan, and this sweet little lady is [sniffles] Yeah, Finn. I love all my little babies so much. [Dabs eyes with No way! Check this out! [Lady shows up with a reusable grocery bag and It's Mom's manual for raising beautiful children. Aw, BMO! When was the last time you washed your controller? [ Um, ah, I-I think it's gettin' kinda late. Um, puppies need sleep. [Lady kicks We'll hang out soon. [ [yawns] Breakfast time. [He gets up to go make breakfast] Sorry honey, I'm on guard duty. [ [ AHHHH! [ You guys are getting big! Okay! [yawns] Excuse me. Mom's manual suggests that I read you guys a story. [Pulls out "Baby Eating Fox and the Babies"] This was your daddy's favorite book when he was cute like you! [Where his name, " This is a lot darker than I remember! Um, gimme a sec. [ Yeah, okay. Sorry sweeties, Mom's manual says no. [T.V. throws a rubber duck at Take 'em out for fresh air huh? [He stretches to look outside] There m- there might be a giant fox out there. [falls asleep] Or some-some other predator. [wakes up] Hey! [The pups were reading the book and Okay everyone, your mom wanted me to take y'all out side. [T.V. reaches for a flower, but is pulled back] Ah ah ah, be careful. [Charlie flies up to catch a butterfly, but is pulled down] No Charlie, no. Too much germs, you know? [The butterfly glances back in response to being called "germy"] Everybody just stick together and don't do anything and we can all take a nap. Then- [ AHHHH! OH MY GLOOB! No! NoOoOoO! IT'S EVERY PARENT'S WORST NIGHTMARE! NO! No! Noo! [ [Lady comes down to see No, no it's- it's all in the manual you see- it's- it-it's got a fe- [falls asleep] What the- What are you doing?! Let me go! [struggles in vain] Hold on, hold on a minute. Just- just lemme- Y'all better watch out! [Tries to stretch, but is too tired. He looks up and sees the pups flying towards him] Puppies?! What are you doing?! Go back inside! The manual's gonna flip!  I'm sorry for being such a little stinker kids. Come on and show the old man watcha got! [ You did! I'm super proud y'all and I'm duper sorry too. [Gathers the pups in his arms] I've been tryin' to make you know about safety without actually learning about safety the way I did, by not listening to MY mom when that snake jumped out of the policeman's boombox. Yup! I've been tryin' to make them about safety without actually learning about safety the way I did, by not listening to MY mom when that snake jumped out of the policeman's boombox. Hey guys. I'm back. [walks up the stairs] Nah, nah, it's cool. It turns out the pups can pretty much take care of themselves. They don't really need me around. Yeah. I guess rainicorns age really fast. They're basically like older than me already. Kil Whan has a beard now! Ah, it's okay! I got a slammin' family right here too! [hugs them] Plus all my stuff is here. Finn? Finn?! Hey guy, where's my buddy? Whoa. Alternate-wish-world-Finn is mad uglies! [Shift to Bartram] Hey, I'm mad uglies too! Everything looks nuts! [Excitedly] What?! I wish for- a sandwich! Nah, sandwich is good, [Demonstrates the size with this hands.] maybe about... this big.... or this big. On ciabatta bread maybe... mmm I don't know, whatever you have is your choice. [Silent] Oooh... [Holding a sandwich and chewing a bit of it in his mouth.] Mmm, yeah, ah well, it's Finn's wish. Let's just see how it plays out. I got confidence in my boy! [Shifts backside into a chair structure and sits.] Besides, I'll hang onto my wish in case i need it. [Takes a bite of the sandwich and the pickle falls out onto the floor.] Awww! I love you Prismo. [Shifts back to normal to grab jar.] I'm serious man, you're like a strong number three on my 'Cool Guys List.' Ah man, my dad use to make pickles [Opens jar and takes one out], it's all he use to talk about, he'd obsess about them all the time, when I'd come in from playing he'd be like "Here, [Eating sandwich, talking with full mouth.] Mm-mm, man your view of relationships is very bleak, don't you get lonely? [Now conscious and ferociously biting Finn's metal arm.] Three, two, one... go! We're three nice dudes, havin' fun! We got warm bubble water, on our buns! I love this spa, and that's a fact! But if I stay too long, I get a pruny back! [Begins beat boxing as well.] Hey man, I'm right here! That's not me man! Finn! I'm in the spa bath! Oh man! [Panics and inflates his head] Make Finn okay! I wish for a safe Finn! [cite] [Shrinks back to normal] What? [Looks shocked.] [Vomits.] [Exits the tub.] I'm sorry, that's a lot of pressure man... [Eats egg and picks himself up.] Oh, okay. Ooo, think... think! [Stares at Prismo with surprise.] Chaa... The lipstick! The Lich's... [Gasps] Change the Lich's wish! And go home! Okay, okay, I wish Lich's wish- was for me. And Finn, to go back home to Ooo! [Getting teary eyed.] It worked! Ha ha! It already happened! And it never happened! Nothing, cause I saved everybody! [Picks up jar and reads a small note.] Hmm... I gotta get that guy a girlfriend. Man, it's crazy to think I was born here. In this alley. Popped right out of my dad's head for some reason. [ Son? I ain't nobody's son but Joshua and Margaret! Though it is weird that you got exactly the same stretchy power as me. Wait, can Finn come with us? We're kind of a package deal. Well then I'd better write him a note. [He takes out a pen and some paper and writes a note.] Whoa! Who are you, anyway? Why do you keep laughing? Great fantasy sci-fi vibe, man. And that black hole really adds an extra dimension to the place. That explains a lot, actually. What? Huh? Warren, how does everyone know me? A museum? All about me?! This is wild. But it feels so right, you know? [Gasps when he notices some pictures on the wall] Hey! It's my fifth birthday party. And my graduation. And when I put a snail in my mouth. And when a snail put me in its mouth. And... [The final picture depicts Cool. But you know it's a little late to try connecting with me, right? [Gasps] Is that clown cake for me? [He shrinks himself and excitedly begins eating the cake.] [Wearing the belt] I love it! Still never gonna call you dad, though. With key ha-a-a-a-a... [He trails off as he sees the door] Uh... I am so ready for this. This must be why I can stretch. Hup! [Struggling] This is so complicated and rewarding. Almost there. [Grunting] [Grunting, he picks up the Panzark and carries it outside.] Yay! [Moans] Saving the galaxy's exhausting. I'm dying... for a soft pretzel with mustard. [Groans] [Reading] "Pri-tzels"! Oh. "Pri-vate". Oof! Dude, weren't you, like, dying? Oh, dang. So how do I- More stretching, huh? [He grunts as he enters the Panzark.] Here comes the hero. Ugh. This is too much. What's going on? Where's that Ixcano jerk? So... you're not really dying? Well, I am cool. I'm sorry, Dad. [Begins crying] I wasn't powerful enough to destroy Ixcano! [Sobbing] You're just saying that to make me feel better. [Chuckles] Do more! [Laughs] Make more party bears! And make the tree house! Put party bears on the tree house! Put party bears in the sky! Keep stretching, you old phoney. It only makes me stronger! [He stands up, revealing that he has switched the belts.] Old-fashioned grifting, ya rube! My real dad taught me that trick. I'm the proud pop of a whole bunch of pups. The belt totally applies to me as well. [He shapeshifts to look like a photograph of his children.] See? Whuh-oh. Don't even think about it! Aw, nah! [He grabs the rocket out of the sky.] Leave my kids alone! [He moves the rocket towards the black hole.] My pups are worth it! [He throws the rocket into the black hole.] Bye, Warren Ampersand. Thanks for reminding me what it means to be a good dad [He reverts to his normal yellow color.] by being the worst dad ever. Never even got a pretzel. You've got a lot of meat, Wildberry Princess. Still tastes good. [Mouth full] I'm listening, but I'm gonna keep eating. [Chews pie tray] Sometimes, I think there's a monster who lives in my stomach, and that's why I'm hungry all the time. [Giggles and continues eating] [Whispering] Princess, want me to finish off your pie? [ [Gasps] You're the assassin! Well, I'm no princess, sister! What!? I'd rather be injected with poison! I mean, I will assassinate Wildberry Princess. [Stifled] My nose! [It should be noted that until otherwise noted all lines from Me-mow show her inside of Oh, uh, yeah. So, um, Wildberry Princess. So, maybe it wouldn't be so bad to be killed. I don't know. I'm just thinking out loud here. Uh, I'm sorry, Wildberry Prin...cess... [Hears bells, looks at a bag of meat, grabs Wildberry Princess's crown] You should... let me... do something... and... it will be...good. [Places Wildberry Princess's crown on the meatbag] [Punching the meatbag] Eat this! And that! Ooh, how do you like this, Princess! Duoo! I'm gonna pick you up now and carry you... to the window! Wildberry Princess is dead! [Puts a finger to his mouth] Shh... [Gives a thumbs up, Finn and Wildberry Princess are speechless] [pained groan] Oooh! [ Finn [grabs Finn's shirt] help me! Uhh... Finn, uh, sing mom's lullaby. I'm so tired, Finn, from the meat. Please, you have to lull me to sleep. I know you carry mom's music box around in your backpack! Please, pleeeaaase... [ Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! [Finn continues] [whispers] Sorry... [ Phew... If I can just grab that antidote... [He pokes Me-mows face twice then grabs it] Ah-ha! I did it! [quiet] Noooooo!! [Clearly intoxicated] Hey, everybody, everything's cool... Right, right, well, we should take her somewhere safer... I know where to stash you, princess. Follow me. [ Here, nobody can take us by surprise. Finn, stand here with your back to the cliff. I'll stay with Wildberry Princess. [gravely] To do what must be done. [He prepares his hands to push Wildberry Princess] I...I...I probably shouldn't! [Falls over weakly] I'm full of poison... I'm coming-- [he starts crawling, but immediately puts his face to the ground] [Takes a deep breath and enlarges his liver to 51 times its normal size] Dog liver times fifty-one! [singing like a rockstar] Big liver, big liver, yeah!! Are you naked? Hehe, we all need a hospital. Hey, dude. Yeah. Okay. Just give me a few more months in here and I'll be ready. [passes hand over face] [he starts crying] Yeah. It's unfortunate we can't enjoy some of these cool things we're passing by, but I guess we could do that the next time we're in the Desert of Wonders, whenever that is! You are killing me, PB! I'm glad James is on this trip. Hey, James, thumbs up, buddy! I wasn't gonna say anything, but yeah. Maybe when we get to know him better, it'll be charming. Mostly looks like it's just dirt here. Do it! Ha ha! [rock hits his helmet] [growls quietly] [pointing behind Finn] [stammering fearfully] Mnh. Mnh. James, that's not helping! Dude, I found us some flares! I saved us! Good Grod! I love you, James! You know, James, I wasn't sure about you at first, but you're okay. [to Finn] I take it back. [shape-shifts to look like a bird] This guy's totally cuckoo! This is my cuckoo face. [growls in frustration] Finn, PB, can I speak to you in the other room, please?! [nods] Hm. What's up with that James dude? Wake up. Dude's a saboteur. You see anything, brudda? It can't end like this. I got a lady and five kids! I thought I'd outlive at least one of them! Your lucky coin? Wha—? I don't know, man. [walks up to James' clone] Here's your coin, James. Ehh. BMO, what's wrong? [Placing his hands on BMO's frame.] I think he broke his egg. Hey, BMO, this will cheer ya up! [He does a handstand and stretches his buttcheeks to enclose Finn's face.] Well, I'm outta ideas. [Finn glares] What? Oh, man, James Baxter is so good, man. He always knows just what to say to cheer a guy up! So good! Yeah, man, I wanna be like James Baxter, always rollin' in on a beach ball, saying his name in a horse voice, making people smile. [sighs] Let's do it! [Neighs] [Neighs] [Whispering] Sheesh, tough crowd. [Nods] Yeah, man, so unique! No, it's like, he's shredding on a guitar and learning how to shred isn't just copying the exact notes as someone else's solo. You need to learn how to do your own solo. [Imitates guitar riff.] Dude, I think we do got something. Alright, BMO, play the video. I'll scrub, [to Finn] you take notes. [Adjust BMO's settings to speed up the video.] [Adjust BMO's settings to slow down the video.] [Laughs too.] BMO, zoom in on my mouth [laughs causing BMO to laugh too.] The Institute of So Und. [Gasp] Look at this tricked out studio! Half stacks! Full stacks! Oooh, distortion pedals! These sounds make feel-good, right here. [puts hand over his heart area] [Hands clipboard back to Finn.] Yeah, maybe, maybe it could be lower, I don't know. See that sound? I drew that sound connected to two other sounds. [Steps back and stands next to Finn.] That's it, the missing thing in our thing! So we gotta create feel good body actions to go with our feel good sound! [Puts down clipboard] Dude, seriously, I think our thing is gonna change the world. When people experience it, it's going to make them so happy! [Yawns] Yeah, man, yeah. [Points] Hey, there's the sad girl.  [Finn and No no no, wait a sec! Reserve judgement until you've see the freshed-up version of our thing. What's wrong? Let's just do the thing. [Pops out of the only flower present] Sorry, I act like a little kitty cat! [Carrying Finn he runs and dodges another dragging arm attack.] Dang, this is real! [He stops as he sees another attack, but both are pounded into the ground with one punch.] [In pain] Eeeee, he broke my squishy bones! [Still in pain] Finn, when we wake up in the 9th Dead World, promise me you'll listen for this sound [rhythmic clap.] It's just that there are a lot of dead people there, we might get separated. I'll be the one going [rhythmic clap.] Yeah, we know him!! His name's James Baxter, he just travels around on his beach ball making people happy. [stuttering] [scared] It can't end like this. Yeah, that's like the twenty-fifth time, right? Totes. So what? Clone him up, girl. Come P-Gum, don't be all cold-hearty! [later, in the Candy Kingdom] And remember the time James saved PB from that contaminated cupcake? [shouting] Jameses! [all the Jameses stop dancing] Alright, who's in charge here? Explain this biz, James II. [whispering to Finn] PB ain't gonna like this. Nah, man. PB's no dummy. She'll find out. It's only a matter of time. There's Princess Bubblegum! [laughs] What a show! Come on PBs, just sit here with us for five minutes. Come on! Five minutes! Mother of Grob! Whoo-hoo-hoo! [Laughing] Hey bear dude, sorry to drop in like that. Whoa. Jermaine?! We must be dreaming at the same time again. I was just hanging out with a couple of ladies outside... or a couple of the same lady. Then bam! Sky-boxed! Jermaine? You okay, man? Oh. Hey, listen, um, maybe we should get together in the  awake world? You know, meet in meat-space? In the dream, Jermaine was wearing a bear suit. I wonder what that symbolizes. Maybe it means Jermaine needs us to visit. You want the can or the cup? [Pours half the contents of the can into a mug.] [Sips] Hmm. I'd hate it if my kids didn't ever see each other... [He frowns at a 'picture' of the puppies and one of Lady Rainicorn, made from his hand.] Or if Viola shoved We're all getting older. We should go see him now, or we might regret it. Huh. Yeah. The only constant is change, bro. Yipe! [Laughs] Hey Jermaine, this thing is rad--Whoa! [Also puts his hands on Jermaine's shoulders.] Yeah, you got a plan B for Bryce, or what? No, Jermaine, we'll make you fried rice. Whoo-hoo! I've never even made fried rice before! [To Finn] Get the plates. [While pouring fried rice onto each of the plates,] Du-u-ump! [He then places what appears to be a carved-radish flower on each plate with each syllable,] Pre-sen-tation. [He hands Jermaine a knife and fork.] To brothers! [He raises his silverware in toast.] Let's eat! Sesame oil and salt. Salt is one of the five taste sensations. I snooched a little from outside. Why? But it'll look decent when I triple combo this bozo with this thing, right? Like this, bro! [Grunting] Aah! Oof! Oof! Why is this thing so dense? I got him! Hup! Sha-boom! Woah, watch it! Cut his arms, Finn! Wha--? [Pumping his fists in the air,] Awesome, dude! We won! Dude, I never farted on the wing of a falcon. [Snorts] Chill, Jermaine. Yeowch! Woah! Come on. Dad didn't have a favorite. He just liked my fart jokes. Ow. Dad loved us both. [Jermaine punches him again.] You could've left any time. If you punch me again I'm gonna fart. Huh?! [Lying back on the grass,] Maybe with all their stuff gone they had no reason to stay. [with his mouth full] Thanks. Yup. Mom and dad passed down some pretty good genes. [chuckles] Well, [camera goes down to his stomach, And so they never told me. I don't know. They never told me. Ha! Like this? Like this? Who's it for? .....It's for... um... [Taking viola] Uh... okay. Finn! Aw, man, is it really you? I'm trapped in this dream, and I can't wake up! Make-out dreams? Nice... Hey, I won't judge. Mm-hmm. I don't think she's real. Just wanted to make sure you were real. Our dreams must be linked for some reason. Careful! If you grunk up the dreamscape with your subconscious fears, the whole thing'll blow apart! Just shrink down like me. 'Cuz I sleep a lot. What did you say?? Help us! Dad, are you okay? Yeah... Yeah, it's nuts! Fast as nuts. Well... that's kinda boring for me... 'cuz that's my normal power, you know? Remember, this is just a dream! Keep climbing! Break it! Yeah. Are you? Yeah, yeah, yeah! [Now having a big human nose] Nope, it's fine. Nah, it's just dream residue. Forget about it. [Calmly] Everything's normal. [Finn pinches him. Yeah, mans. Actual Ow, man, come on! Man, Ice King, you better roll on. Come on, man, not the food. That's gonna be kind of weird. All right, all right, all right. Wenk, wenk. Or we could get a real good night's sleep and start fresh and early in the morning. Wenk, wenk. [Happy] Lady! Oh, Lady! ...I'M... PUPPIES!? Shelby? [wakes up] Hmm? Whoa, Shelby! What's going on there? With your butt? You can chop up a worm and get two? I thought that was a myth. Ah, it's easy. You just give him something sharp and get him to fight bad guys. Yeah, you might have to stretch all big if he gets in real trouble. But, yeah. I think the swimming hole's right around the corner! First one in the water is...um...first one in the water! [Laughs then falls down] Ah! Uh, eh, uh. [Finn laughs, rubs his short hair, and throws his clothes on the ground] Faster, we're getting a swirl! You ready to get out? Let's get BMO to make us some sassages. Maybe with that one mustard? [Sassage Flare comes down Hopefully BMO sees that. Yeah. I'm gettin' what? Grob, dude! You're hat's alive! [pets Finn's hat and laughs] This is crazy! [pets Finn's hat some more] He likes me! Yeah, man, hats can be anything pants, other people. It's fine! Yeah, it's a miracle. Now he can listen to our rad jokes and hang out. [seeing the food on the table] Aw yeah! Aw yeah! BMO! Ha ha! You know it! Yeah, okay. [takes some milk, pours it into a bowl, and he and Finn both dip a sassage in the milk, and then they both eat theirs] [feeling Finn's hair] Your head looks weird with short hair man, heh, heh, it feels like a peach. Hey, don't eat the—the food? [sniffs twice] Yep. [trying to grab Little Dude] Quit it! [grabs him] Gotcha! BMO hit ya on the butt. [laughs] Tsk, it's probably Ice King again, dude. Man, we should tell him we know he sleeps on the top of our house. [glass shatters offscreen] Oh. [picks up Little Dude] Gross. [gasps] [stretches Little Dude back to Finn's bed] [panting] Where is he?! [straining as he tries to take Little Dude off of Cream Puff Gentleman] Ow. [to Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving] Dude, use your powers! Just think of something positive! Something comforting! Uh, yeah. Just think about your mom and use your magic. Yeah. He deserves to come back good. Life, man! Okay. Let's go skin an evil bear. If I hear another peep, there's gonna be trouble! Final warning. Okay, go ahead, BMO. Okay, welcome back to the program. We're talkin' with our special guest, Finn the Human. Now, Finn, before the break, you were sayin' somethin' interesting—that you're gettin' outta the romance biz. So, what happened? And you're not just sayin' that to, uh—[someone knocks on the door several times] [ Hold on, hold on. [takes off headphones] What's that noise? Can you see who it is? So, it's goin' pretty good, huh? What did I tell you?! Ew. Hmm! [running after them] Wait, I'm coming, too! I'm gonna eat popcorn and make hilarious jokes. [empties the last kernel from his bag into his hand] Aw, who ate all my popcorn? [munching popcorn] How much farther? This popcorn's not gonna last all day. [shrinks] Alright, now it might. Oasis? More like, "No way, sis!" [laughs] [gasps] [climbs into Finn's mouth] You could say I got out of there [Finn lifts him out of his mouth with his tongue] in the "lick" of time. Zing! This is, like, the opposite of what you wanted. [laughs] More like a quick beating! Hey-oh! Yes. "Tank" you. Shoosh. [Harsh whispering] We are... Why does she keep saying that? Don't worry, princess. We're gonna get you out of here. [All three exit the castle by sliding down the castle's ice path on a sled.] Whoo-hoo! yeah! yeah! Trying to get a signal, it's like everyone in Ooo is on their phones or something. [Arm stretches back to body, Man, now we have to kick that frog out of his new home. Finn & Tah ha, but we punch monsters. She's dodging the question. You can go back to the waiting room now, ma'am! I think we did a good job. Finn, knights are loyal to their king. Aa Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba! Loyalty to the King! [Pats Finn's shoulder.] Get out of here! Alright! We did it, dude! [Pats Finn's forehead.] Did this Ice King shave his back or something? Relax, dude, it's just me. Heh hee heh. These whiskers would make anyone look like the Ice King. Pfft, he knows what it is! Man, these ladies really wanna get married. Relax dude [Stretches ear] just get behind my ear shield. [Dives after them.] [Face palms.] Awww, haa haa hoo. [Moves uncomfortably] Hey, do you have bigger chairs? Huh? Well can I have a bigger stool, then? Sorry. Looks like a mushroom. Someone throwing mushrooms? My legs. Why? Why? Okay, but why, though? [Stops walking, faces Finn] Hey, how long do you think capturin' a flyin' mushroom takes? Yeah, that too. How long? Tell who? ...King Of Ooo? Yeah, that was sorta cool. But you know, PB just left her kingdom to 'im. And all her stuff, so what's that about? [Sniffs, stops, nose and mouth stretch out forward and sniffs for something, turns around] I smell mushrooms. Check it out. [points to a relatively large mushroom] Big enough for KOO's tiny heiny! Mmm, yeah... [Finn and Victim's lost a lot of blood. Clean entry wounds. It's an expert job. That's terrible! Well, I've heard enough. Come on, Finn. Let's go arrest Marceline. That's right. I forgot about Ooo's extensive vampire community. [Imitates buzzer] Come on! I know that. Ain't no rookie. I'm already bad cop. Okay, let's not pay seeds. Me and my partner will "interrogate" the suspect police-style. Meanwhile, you sharpen up your pitchforks mob-style. Physical contact! Officer resisting arrest! Boom! I'm sorry. [Smooches] Let me kiss it! [Smooching] You done it this time, Marceline. You sucked the life out of defenseless animals! You think I'm buying that boom-boom mountain? You want proof? Look. [Crash!] Proof of how off I'm gonna go if you don't confess. I'm wilin' out! Sorry. Dream stuff always means something. Guys, look. No. But what's that? Remember how I said my fear of vampires was based on ignorance? Well, I think that revelation was actually based on true ignorance. Yeah, man, don't be ignorant. Okay, but I'm gonna hold on to your shirt. Y-y-you tell me, m-man. Ugh, glob. Something big just dropped in my gut. I can't be here, man. It's too real. It's just a jam sesh. Is that what you're gonna jam with? Pretty good. [They continue walking and come up to Marceline's house.] I don't think you mastered it yet. Oh, dude. There's a note. [Reading note on Marceline's door] "Hey, guys, I had to run out, but I'll be back," blee-bloo-blop, "Don't go in my house." Yeah. Just "Don't go in my house" in all caps... written in blood. Eliminating desire from my heart. It helps pass the time. No, man, I got a mental block with Cloud Hunt! Oh, what?! Bring it on, brother! Now explain the rules 'cause I forget. Got it. [Glances at Marceline's house] Yes. She's gonna kill us. Once she finds out she's gonna tie us up and eat us like a spider. Okay, man. I can do this. [Begins pumping his fist] Egh! Egh! Egh!! Here she comes... Let's get outta here. She didn't wash hands! Whatcha doin'? Brilliant... but how's it gonna work? Yeah, yeah, awesome, yeah!! No, nah, nuts! [Whispering to Finn] This is so wrong. [Making a hole in the wall with a spoon] We've crossed the line! I'm gettin' outta here, man! I dunno, man. Go scope the scene. What happened, man? Well... whaddaya mean? What happened? [Finn stares blankly.] Bro? Why are you talking?! Well, if she's awake, she can definitely hear you talking! Well, now we're both quietly screaming. Dude, I think she sees us! Well, yeah! So sorry. What?! Hmm? [He covers himself with a towel even though he was already wearing one. He goes to the bedroom.] Hey, man, did— AAAAAAH!! I like your swordsmith hat. Am I your special guest? Dang. Great sword making, Pep But. [Finn and Yeah, he seems pretty fun for an old guy. Hey, wait a minute... I'm an old guy! I get it. It's air mattress talk. Ss-ss-ss-ss. Aren't you giving a concert tonight? Ss-ss-ss. At the Ghost Amphitheater? Ss-ss-ss. Yes. Sit down, man! No! [slaps orb out of Finn's mouth] Don't put that biz in your mouth, man! They could be booby-trapped or poisoned or— Hmm. Okay. Anyways, we should try to find her before—[Finn pushes a pearl against Anyway... [dusts himself off] I don't care how easy this vamp's supposed to be. We should hole up somewhere before the sun goes down—It's down. Great. What?! So what's the plan for this chump? Given that he can see in the dark probably and could come from anywhere at any time and suck the flesh off our bones! Green light. On it! Finn, I got one! My blood, man! I love my blood. [PS vamp plays by old timey rulez, cant enter house etc. HTH] Get in me! Nop. Not gonna happen, man! Eek! Uh, I'm a magic dog with magic blood! Uh, guys, I'm not feeling that great eith Ugh! [He is riding a bucking half-stag half-marauder] What'd you say? Whoa! [Gets tossed and then kicked over to Finn] Awwww here it comes! Lay it down Finn! [The Head Marauder starts to clap and the others follow] He still cries when he poops. Thanks for being cool guys. Wait up, Finn! [Boulders are rolling down the mountains Mountain Man is crying] It's comin' from up there! Yeah, do it Finn! Hit 'im with a boulder! And then hit 'im with another rock! Whoa. This guy's got problems. Whoa! What? But Finn, we're not gonna shut down the roughhouse for real are we? That’s like math. [While fist bumping Finn] Aw, man. Finn this guy seems like a real nut job. You know what I mean? I don’t wanna get sucked into this guy’s hang-ups. [Jumps of Mountain Man with Finn] So be it brother. [Being petted by animals] Maybe you can solve everyone's problems. Like a cherub with its bottom out. Alright I’m gonna- [sighs] stay here this time. Right on man! The marauders are going crazy over the petting! They're petting each other raw! Check ‘em out! Just promise him anything, he’s out of his gourd. Whoa, dude. Hold on. So this guy wants this and that guy wants that, but man. What do you want? [Flashback begins “What dooo yooou waaant?”] [Laughs] Wow, that’s pretty corny man, but let’s do it dude! Wooohoo! No! [Marauders lift up Finn and cheer] Stop! I've got a problem. This dolphin fell in love with me! Who is he talking about? What?! Then why am I running so hard? She's in trouble! [runs faster] Hey, wizard, how do you know Marceline? Oh. Then what? But, like, if you know all this, why not just do it yourself? [yawns] Did it work? Me neither. Huh? Whoa. Whoa! Hmm... there she is! [walks up to young Marceline] Hey, little Marcy. We're your friends! Ahem! Do you know where your memory core is? Ooo! Ooo! Could be jams and pickles down there!  [opens door] Weird. I think this door leads to a new memory; with food in it! Ooo, ice cream [opens new door] Come on, Finn! Who's this guy supposed to be? Yo, man, your thing is glowing. We must be close to the core. I see another door over there. Come on. This way, Finn! Check out this whacked out memory crack! It's ba-nay-nay down here! All these orbs must be her memories. Play hot-cold with your forehead! Cold. Definitely cold. Warmer. Warmer, warmer! Whoa, hot. Hot, hot, hot! That must be the one! Huh? Oh, no! Don't worry, Finn! I got the scent. [sniffs] Ah. Follow me. I could smell them in there. So what's the plan? [fist bumps Finn] Nice. [bangs shovel against shed and Tiny Goblin comes out] No, no, sorry. Shh, shh, wait! Psshh. Hey, you wanna bump baby lumps? Yeah. Now get out of here. [The creatures scamper.] Eh, it's probably just puberty calling. Ka-psshh.  [Finn and We'd probably have to fight Gladiator Ghosts. We're back! That prize kinda stinks. Let's go, Finn. My thighs hurt.  [ Mmm-hmm. But, hey, if you replace me with a dummy, I could stay down here and dig for lava. Then I'd forge a molten hula-hoop. Morale, dude, This tomb will be as fun... [singing] ♪ As a tropical island, as a tropical island, as a tropical island, as a tropical island. ♪ Check it out, dude. [ Dig-dig-dig-dig-dig-dig-dig. Two gongs? Something crazy's going on up there. [He stretches up to the surface and pulls the dirt dummy under.] It's me, Oh, this is bad. Finn? Yeah. I lives. Finn, come with me, man. [Finn suddenly turns around and throws a punch at So, how's your side of the plan going? To escape. I dig and stuff, and you fight to win, 'member? Ghosts don't got meat. [inner thoughts] Hmm... Finn's acting weird. Probably due to a decrease in morale. Gotta get him that lava hula-hoop. Gotta liven up this unhallowed ground.... for Finn. [ ♪ Puttin' on lotion, sittin' by the ocean, rubbin' it on my body, rubbing it on my body... ♪ ♪ Get me out of this caa-a-ve, 'cause it's nothing but a gladiator graa-a-ve. And if I stick to the plaa-a-n, I think I'll turn into a lava maa-a-n. I think I'll turn into a lava man! ♪ [He suddenly notices Finn stomping and chomping on the dummy. He gasps. Finn turns at the sound.] What about the plan? You're gonna kill me? No! Finn? No! What? [lets go of Finn and returns to his original shape.] Dude, did you...? Was that all fake? Did you act all that out? Was that part of your plan? So you planned to get all cozy with the Fight King and almost kill me from the get-go? Why didn't you say so? That's some funky junk, brother. Oh, yeah. I bet they're like us. Best bros who got trapped in that arena. Ommmmm... [Whispering] [Whispering] Don't know. I'm thinking of pillows stuffed with spaghetti. Neat! Oh, okay! I'll try! Billy's big ol' beef fingers! Me, too! What is wrong with you?! Here I go! This is our first fate-of-the-world deal! Running this fast makes my stomach hurt! Whoa! Punch it in the eye! Let's blow this stand! There! Out over the lake! [Turning into a boat] I'm your dingy dog! Waaaah! Then let's go! [Latching onto Finn like a backpack] It's okay! [Whispering] He's gettin' his powers back! Weird! Look out!! [Finn ducks out of the way.] That's it! I'm gonna bark 'im! Finn!! Buddy!! Uh, yeah, you are, dude. Huh? [To Princess Bubblegum.] You look like sick, grey meat, but we're gonna jack you up so awesome. Yeah, man, and then we'll do magic tricks. Yeah, like [ Whoo-oo! Oh, jeez!! [He hides behind Finn.] What's wrong with Princess Bubblegum?! I know, man, but she just seems... weird. Uh... Okay, dude. Oh. Gotcha. I'll go get some tea! [He cuts his way through the pile of flowers and exits.] Whoa... [Peppermint Butler runs away on all fours.] Uh... somethin' weird's goin' on... [Startled] AH! [Somewhat scared] Hey... Princess... Sorry you're not feelin' good. [She says nothing and looks at him annoyed (still breathing deeply).] Oh! I'll sing you a song! You love it when I sing songs! Uh... [Princess Bubblegum convulses and yells gibberish.] Uh, this song's not that good. It's a bad one. I... I'm stoppin'. [She yells again.] ...And starting a new song! [Plays bongos] [Princess Bubblegum yells in utter agitation. Her bed begins jumping up and down. Suddenly, demonic flames engulf the room.] AAH... [Princess Bubblegum touches him] No, man... no... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Wait! Hold on! Listen... PB's bed was on fire. [Whispering] She made it on fire. No, man. With her brain... I think... [Finn stares confused.] Look, man, I'll show you! Shh!! [ I'm lookin' in! [Looks through keyhole] Oh, my gloob! You don't even know, man. Look! [ Dude! I think we should let the Ice King help! He can freeze her, which could buy us some t— Woooh, do it! [Propels Finn towards her with his hind end.] Finn!! [Amused] Whoa... Pussy cat! Come here! Hey! Help! Who are these guys? This is a great fight! I guess that's because I meet Lady Rainicorn every day at four o'clock on the dot. Oh shoot! I'm late! Aw, man, that sounds awesome! I do want to stay and fight those guys, but I also want to hang out with my girlfriend. [sighs] I should probably go. I'll see ya later, buddy. [ [sighs] Oh! Sorry! Sorry I'm late. Finn and I were fighting this shark and science cat, and I lost track of time. Anyway, I’m here now, M'lady, and I have brought to you half an orange. Nice! Now make that green! [Lady turns the river green.] [giggles] Ha ha ha! Yeah, that's good. Sleep! But we were supposed to play viola together! [sighs] Yeah. Sorry again for coming so late. Oh, hey, Shelby. I'm fed up, Shelby! Whenever I hang out with Lady Rainicorn, I miss out on fun times with Finn. And then when I hang out with Finn, I'm missin' out on Lady Rainicorn! [He lifted his hands in the air and he crashes into a tree.] Oh! [ Ah, isn't this great? This is totally great. [To Finn] Isn't it? [To Lady Rainicorn] Isn't it? She said she also thinks it's great. Yeah. Hmm... [ Yeah! Anybody have a joke? She said, "who's there?" 쟤가 설사래. ("He said "diarrhea.") Uh, no. No, she didn't say, "diarrhea who?" She didn't... say it. Lady, how 'bout you tell a joke? Uhh... well, the joke doesn’t translate very well. Noooo! Don’t leave. [Gets up to pace.] If there was only some way you two could talk to each other directly. [Pause] Oh, dude! I just remembered! There's a universal translator device at the bottom of Lake Szelezon! Yeah, I can't remember why I threw it in there. Let's all go and get it! Trust me, Finn, she’s the Rowdy Queen. She can do anything! [chuckles] All according to plan. [Runs up to them] Here's the translator. [He puts the translator around Lady's neck] Let’s see here. [Turns on the device and switches through the options] The voice options are... Old man, nerdy alien, ooor nightmare? [He has it switched to nightmare] Try sayin' something, toots! [sighs] Well, at least with old man option we can understand him, I MEAN HER! I mean you, sugar! [sighs] I remember why I drowned that translator now. Whoa! [Being bounced by Lady’s wavy flying style] Lady! It's a little rocky in the back seat here! [Flies off Lady’s tail end] Laaaadyyy! [Falls towards the forest] Fiiiiinn! [Turns into a flat hang glider-like object] Lady! [Floats down into the trees and onto the ground] [He gets up] Lady! Finn! [He grows huge and shouts above the trees] Y'all around here? [Looks around] Dang it! [Turns to see fireworks coming from the trees accompanied by the sounds of Lady and Finn having fun with the rings] [Burst through the trees and scares everyone away] There you are! [Shrinks down] Where were you guys? Noooo! [Looking sad] I fell off your tail end! [Turns and looks mad] I was shouting your name! Whoa. That's cool! You got ten of them? [Lady shows Yeah! Thanks man! Yeah, they're awesome. [Depressed] Hey, Lady, you wanna go play music together or somethin'? Oh. [Goes over to Finn] Hey Finn. After this next game do you wanna go adventurin' with me? Humph! Humph Humph Humph! [sighs and looks sad] [sighs and grumbles] Mmmm, Nothin'! No! I do. [Looking hurt and sad] No YOU go ahead! [In a harsh tone] And YOU have fun with MY girlfriend! [Finn and Lady are seen flying away outside the window] [sighs] [sighs] [Looks over at a Finn-and- Uh, yes, hello. Um, I’m lookin' for Finn the Human and Lady Rainicorn. [Cloud man throws a soda to someone] Hello, can you hear me? Hello. A while ago?! [ Nooo [Falls onto his knees with his arms in the air] oooooo! My girlfriend... in the arms of my best pal! [Picks up phone] Well, TWO can play at that game, sweet cheeks! [He scrolls through his contacts] Let's see... "Doug, Todd, Jerry, Dennis, Reggie, Peter, George, Larry, Luke, David, Benton, Mike R., Mike H., Mike A., Gareth, Jennings, Mr. International, Mr. Outrageous, Captain Majesty, The Flying Lettuce Brothers, Pete the Punk"... [gasp] Tiiffaanyy! [In an evil tone] PERFECT! Muhuhaha! [Calls Tiffany.] [Him and Tiffany are sitting on stumps playing viola] Yeah, yeah, louder. Oh, hey guys. I'm just sharing a tender moment with my beautiful friend Tiffany. Well I’m trying to make you both jealous! Becaaause, Tiffany's a boy! [Tiffany spins around to face the camera] [sighs] I guess I'm just jealous of how much you and Finn like each other. I know. Gaah. I'm sorry I'm an idiot baby. Forgive me? [Lady and Yeah! Waaay better! [they hug] [Lady is wrapped partially around Let's never be stupid again. [Sniffs] I'm tellin' you dude, my pie-dar's goin' 'nay-nays. [Sniffs] Oww! TT! Where is the pie at?! [Shelby gets off Tree Trunks] Yeah, but what the heck is goin' on here? [Points at Ice Kng that is behind him, sitting on the grass and holding the book] Happy birthday! Right! That's because- No dude, you're blindfolded. [Puts hands on the blindfold] Keep the blindfold on. I've got a surprise for you. [Takes blindfold off of Finn] Surprise! That's not the surprise. This is! [Struggling to talk] This isn't the gift! We have to take the train to get to the gift. I'll go get the tickets. Heheh. I'm gonna go grab a schedule! [Climbs off the seat and out of the train car] [Comes back with a schedule in his hand.] Found a schedule! Hey man, this is kinda a bad scene. Maybe we should get off the train and huff it to your surprise. [Crosses arms] Alright. Now I know this is going to sound crazy, but what about the conductor? [Disappointed] Oh. Why not? Whatever, man. I'm gonna go sit and look at the schedule. [Turns and does so] Yeeeeeeeaaah? What?! No way, he was cool and awesome! Dude, I think you're waaay off. What'dya think we should do? Me neither! [Raises arms quizzically and then crosses them.] Maybe the murderer is just too smart for us. The conductor's still on the train! Yay, you did it, you solved it, Finn! What?! Humpf. Thank you. [Licks the rest of the paint off of himself.] Yup. You were so focused on the murders because you never even noticed! [Flashback shows that when Nope! Not unless you count the train's control panel! Dude, open your eyes! You deserve it, buddy. [Points fork at Finn] Because you're a great friend. Nope! That part was a total accident. Died horribly? Yes. Happy birthday, pal! [Goes back to cutting his cake] Uh, 3 minutes. What about you? What's that? Your invisible watch? Oh, dang, we were both counting fast. Do you even need to breathe, Rattleballs? Huh? Oh, Finn, you're awake! Right. Yeah, I saw that. Oh, yeah, I think so. Maybe. Yeah, pretty freaky. [pulls back his hood, revealing his head is bandaged] Don't worry—ouch— [touches his head] they're all hiding. From me! It's my birthday, man! Lady Rainicorn put together a elaborate surprise party. No, but I know Lady Rainicorn. Ouch! [feels his head] This is totally something she would do. Think about it. Yes, and they'll only come out if they think we'll be surprised. So we got to act like we're totally unaware, okay? Just do what I'm doing. [ Come on, come on! [motions Finn to come with him] I don't know. It didn't take long. [decorates hut with Christmas lights] Collect branches for the hobo fire, dude. [feels head] Ouchies. Just gotta char off the rotten parts—good as new, man! Stay vigilant. Eat your protein. Hmm? [drops hot dog] Shhh! [hushed] Don't talk so loud! They might hear you! Noooo! [grows huge] You'll ruin my surprise party! Oww! [holds head] [groans] [goes back inside hut] Just promise me, Finn. Promise not to look around. [mumbling] ...my birthday's gonna be rad. [moans] What? No, man, they'll surprise party me when they're ready. Be patient. Well, I've been waiting six months! [yawning] [a bug crawls out of his ear] Everything's gonna be fine, even if we have to wait forever. Yeah, but don't worry about it, man. Hmm? Finn? Noooo! Don't ruin the surprise! [stomping on the remains of the chair] Rah! Ah! Ah! [pants heavily] [sees Finn crawling toward the manhole] Noooo! [stretches his arm to grab him and picks him up] Surprise! [reveals marionettes made from trash] "Happy birthday, This is how my party's gonna go down. Shake it, my friends. [bounces marionettes] Hey! Hey! Sure is great seeing y'all here. Really makes me think. Ow. [touches head] [holds up a sock puppet] Lady, did you get extra TP for all the potty people? [as Lady] No. [normal voice] Well, we might have some party poopers here, and I want to be sure they don't wipe their buns on my cake. You won't run away? Finn! Glad I can untie you, buddy. [unties rope] Check it out! Finn finally made it to my party! Finn? You lied to me? [chasing him] What about my party? Don't go! Finn! Surprise! Surprise! Suprise! I did this? Ow. [touches head] They've been waiting for me, Finn, for my b-day! [babbles] Oof. Yoo-a-hee! I'm a woman! I'm a woman! Ring, ring! [as a woman] Eh, hang on, deary. [stretches a phone out of his arm] Hello? [as a man] Baby, I told you never to call me here! Wha... what happened? What? No. It's not even close to my b-day! [takes Peppermint Butler down from the wall] I'm so sorry. Freak deer! [drops Peppermint Butler] [gasps] [prepares to untie a cinder block] Finn! We did it, dude! Not crazy anymore! How's your legs? [laughs] Yeah, like bad breath and eggs. [looking out the window] Get over here, dude. I do see something, but you're making it weird. [pointing] Look. [yelling] Yeah, beat it Magic Man! Got him! Nah, he's magic. Oh, right. [a fly lands on Normal Man's face.] Uh-oh. That's because we freed him from your sick nightmare house. What do you think about that? Who? Phew! Well, we got past those guys. Kick his tiny butt. Yeah, yeah, yeah! We're real late! Happy birthday, puppies! Okay, so, putting it out there—I didn't remember to bring you guys any birthday presents, but I did bring lunch! [takes out a wad of macaroni and sets it on the ground] It's macaroni salad. Happy birthday, Kim Kil Whan. Whoa, neat. Um, well, how are things going, Son? Heh. [gives thumbs up] I get it. What?! But, Son, why? [Gets down on one knee in front of Kim Kil Whan.] But son! [Crawls to Kim Kil Whan.] What would your mother say? Doing this to your poor Pip-Pop! [Opens front door of Tree Fort.] Okay son. Get ready to be glitter-stunned by all this treasu--Oh, yeah. We spent all of it. [Finn and Kim Kil Whan follow Hey Finn. I'm real sorry about this. Somehow I feel like it's kinda my fault. You're gonna sleep... like that? [Sighs and shrinks down so he fits onto the ladder rung easily.] I promise, I'll work this thi--Aaah! [A strange creature steps on [Offscren] Hey buddy, you okay? [Standing in the bathroom] I just feel if we're patient this whole thing will work itself out before you know it. [Sirens wail in the distance, their lights flashing through the bathroom window.] Haha! See, man? Help is on the way! Man, don't you know? The laws ain't made to help earthy cats like us. Nah, man. Listen. Here on our planet, back in the old days, back in the REAL old days, it was just every man for hisself. Scrooblin' and scrat-scroblin' for the good stuff, the greenest valleys, and scrat-scroblin'. And the strongest, meanest men got the best stuff. They got the green valleys and were like, "The rest of you, y'all scrats get sand!" And THAT'S when they made the laws, you see. Once the strong guys got it how they liked it, they said, "This is fair now, this is the law." Once they were winning, they changed the rules up. Haha, that's awesome! Hey, Kim Kil Whan! Aw buddy, I knew you'd come around! [Jumps up and hugs Kim Kil Whan, hanging onto his body.] Haha, fathers and sons, man. That's that REAL thick chowder. [ [In shock at the amount.] Ooh. [ Come on, son! Just let me do the-- [Kim Kil Whan teleports away before [Sighs.] Man, where did I go wrong? [Finn and Oh yeah.... Yeah. Oh no, wait! I just remembered I buried a ton of gold in the front yard! Whoa! Yeah, and you know the penalty for stealing boots. It's poots... on newts. Dude, that isn't a lake. That's an ocean. [Laughing and farting on the Newt] Poots on newts! Poots on newts! [Slow-motion] Poots on newts! Dude. Dude, did you see me? I was all like womp, and then I was all like take this! Womp! Womp! And then... Hey, what’s wrong with you, dude? Say what, now? Um... No... I don't really wanna do it. I'm just messing with you. I'll do it. Hmm... Where to start? Oh, ok. I think we should just take a few steps in the water. You can hold Um... Oh it's ok, dude. I see the problem. It's just your feet. [Manually moving Finn's feet forward one at a time] Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop. [Still moving Finn's feet] Boop. Boop. Hot jam! You're really scared of the ocean. In fact, you're so scared... it gives me an idea. Let's start a business of being scared of the ocean! Ok. Ok. I have a plan to get rid of your fear. We'll start tomorrow morning. Fiiiinn. Finn. Hey, Finn. Wake up. Ready for me to help you get over your ocean fear? Cool... but I can only do this if you ask me. Then get ready for my three-step plan. Watch your troubles melt away with step one! Hey. Hey. Come on. The ocean is your friend, and you got friends all around you right now. Miles and miles of friends. Don't try to struggle, man. [Pulls the blankets back, revealing that Finn is tied to the bed] I'll let you out in a second. You just need to calm down. That's great. You're doing great. Ready for step two? Alright, dude. Step... two! [Unties the rope] Let it hold you, man! Let it hold you like a child! Control your breathing! That means we gotta move to step three. Just don't scream. I'm gonna push you underwater with my jowls. Just don't scream. Don't scream. Don't scream. Hold your breath, Finn. You got it, dude! Finn! Stop it, Finn! Ow! I think we should give up. Look, Finn. It's not that I don't want to help you... I just don't wanna get beat up anymore. I mean this [Pointing to his face] is my bread and butter. I can't have you messing up my bread and butter, dude. Ok. Fine... but only if you swear not to hit me anymore. And also swear to only speak in rhymes. Speak in rhymes all the times. Yes. Perfect. And since you want more... it's time for step four. I'm not that good at counting. [Laughs and grabs a small, rusty submarine] Come on. Let's go kick your fear of the ocean where the sun don't shine... in the sea cucumber. Check it, dude. One hundred percent awesome-itude. You know, it looks way more math if you open up your eyes. See, man? The ocean is beautiful. There's no reason to be afraid of things that are beautiful. [Points] Hey, look! A black abyss! Let's go check it out... sauerkraut. Saying, "Turn around" twice doesn't count as a rhyme, dude. Hey, you swore! Ow! My bread and butter! No, dude! Don't! Don't worry, dude. Everything's cool. This is the perfect segue into level five. [Handing Finn a dive suit] Here, put this on. Just make sure you don't pull the emergency tab. No, dude! I said don't... Yeah, man. Wait... Finn, you did it! You conquered your fear! You're at the bottom of the ocean! Maybe we should celebrate on land. I'm proud of you man. You did it! Whoa, dude! What's with your bellybutton? Nice. Little bird family on vacay. Dad's got the mad beautiful tail feathers; Mommy's taking up the rear all plain-jane styles. [Mother bird farts] Hehe. Glad I get to date a beautiful rainicorn, not some nasty bird. [A messenger bird holding a package flies up to All lady birds around the whole world are beautiful on the inside? Fair enough. Hold still, BMO. Aw dang. Sorry, BMO. [Finally puts the tape in BMO and then quickly runs in front of him] Cool, man, I'm excited! [Stops eating peanuts] What the heck am I looking at? [shouting] [Shakes BMO] [shouting] What do you want from me?! [quietly] Glob it. The Baker's Shard—the purest source of sugar in the known regions. [Changes his appearance into a more sinister one] BMO, destroy the tape. Are we on the level, BMO? I don't want Finn hearing about this. [Turns on the lights and sees the gang] Oh, hi guys. Were you waiting for me in the dark? Nah, BMO's covering for me. I got a job for you guys. [They gather around him] One last score. The Big one. What? Psssh! Tiffany! I'm the same Dude, you guys on board or what?! You really got something better to do?! I know you don't, Tiffany! We ain't keeping it. [the three grow shocked looks] I'm passing the shard off to a mystery dude. The dude has my kid. [Tiffany goes from angry to a mix of surprise of empathy] My Little I have the first part. [Raises hand] OK, let's freakin' do this! [Opens his chest, revealing Tiffany is hidden in there] OK, do your thing, man. Not now, Tiffany! Come on! [Gets Tiffany out of his chest] I did it! For You! Where's my daughter?! Yeah right, that's super-dumb. Hang on, sweetie! [Throws the Baker's Shard, which is caught by Gareth] [gasp] You dirty— Shut it, Tiffany! [Sees the driver] Gimme my daughter.  What the funky fresh, honey? [Scolding tone] That was a long time ago. Before I knew it was wrong! [Sighs loudly and turns his forehead back to normal] I am. I couldn't have done that when I was your age. R-r-r-right. I keep forgetting maths. Finn and I bust their apples tomorrow. Or maybe the Banana Guards will get 'em. [Grows large again] Come on. I'll take you home now. I love you, too. Don't stinkin' do this to me again. I'm old and fat. I'll probably have a heart attack. [Stops] Wait a minute! You're doing a long con right now, aren't you? Now I'm really proud of you! Listen, man. One day, I'm probably gonna have half-rainbow pupsters. I gotta be able to share my babies' culture. [mumbling indistinctly as he reads] Dude, I would love to go on some crazy, made-up adventure with you, but I really gotta read this. So from here on out, I'm just gonna ignore you. [continues reading and mumbling] [shakes head] Shhhh! [nods] [motions for Finn to go away] Finn! [following Finn] Finn, you butt chicken! [grunts and strains as he lifts the Rainicornicopia and drags it back] Finn, all the little voices you're doing are cute, but come on, man! Just let me read. [buries his face again] I can feel you pinching me. Yeah, go play make-believe somewhere else! Hmm? AAAAH! AAH! What did you do to me?! AAAAAAH! AH! AAAH! [screams in pain] Aaah! Finn... what's happening? [pulls the remaining two Moldos off his eyes] AAAH! What—What the hecks, man?! What'd you do to me?! Wha—? Who cares, man?! I'm outta here! Ugh... I was readin' the same paragraph over and over for, like, eleven minutes. I guess I'm gonna give up on learnin' everything about Rainicorn history. Don't tell Lady. Eh, I'll just fake it. You makin' that up? Yeah! Let's do it! [starts running toward the setting sun] [laughs] Loot, bro! [looks around] Looks like a brolicious room to relax in and play video games... bro. [groans] [whispering] I keep forgetting that he lives here now. [normal voice] Ice King, we've told you a thousand times this couch ain't for cuddlin'. It isn't! [groans] Finn, can I speak to you in the kitchen? It's time to kick Ice King out!! [signs language meaning that Ice King needs to go away] Hmmm? [signs language to Finn] Checking him to a hotel room. Lumpy Space Princess stays there. That's how cool it is. Finn, I'm ready to murder the Ice King. Hahaha! Shut up-up-up-up-up, Abracadeez! A sexy wizard like you goes where he wants! What... You do? [faces Ice King] Hey, Abadabs! [holding a plate full of cookies] Why don't you show us that trick you're working on! [Ice King peeks] [with a cookie in his teeth] You're a good wizard! [sips his coffee] This was a great idea, man! It's like he's forgotten all about us! How'd they get the other couch down here? Huh! He's actually not bad! Yeah... [looks at his shape-shifted clock] It's getting pretty late. Kee Oth Rama P... [Finn covers his mouth] I thought he was bluffing. Scary! You don't have any other choice! Do it! Yup! Watch this, everybody! A cooler! With stuff... for the thing! [Accidentally drops cooler and laughs, embarrassed. Everyone cheers; someone says "Party!"] What about me? What do I focus my energy on, Cinnamon Bun? Huh? [Pushes down toaster lever] I thought he was your friend. Man, I'm sleepy. [Yawns] Huh? Oh, yeah, right. [Walks to his bed yawning] Goodnight, homie. Hrrnf!! Ahh... What? [Stomach rumbles.] Alright, alright, you old gut. [Stretches] Oh, I'm sluggin' it today... [Rolls out of bed] Wake up, Finn. Got a busy day ahead of us. Finn? Hmm. Hmmmmm. Shhh... Let me show you how it's done! [Starts dancing; the beetle joins him] Aw, yeah! Huh-hah! Yeah! Whoo! Aaaaah... [Gulps the shake down] Whooooo! [Bugs cheer.] Whoooo! Any more grass shakes, Simon? WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, NO, IT'S NOT!! Y'all are horrible at tellin' jokes. Lemme hitcha with this. Didya hear about the goblin who got his left arm and left leg cut off? Yeah! [Laughs] Yeah! [Laughs] Man this party is nuts! How'd I even get up here?! Whoa! Who's the Party God?! ...Oh. Hahaha! "What do I want most?" [Chuckles] ...What do I want most in the world? Well... I wish Finn would stop leavin' his dirty— [Gasps, in realization] FIIINN!!!! I was on his trail...! And then I... got distracted...!! GAAAH!! What's wrong with my brain?! Cinnamon Bun was right... I can't focus on NOTHIN'!! Party God, I wish that I could focus on finding my friend Finn! WAIT, wait... Is there some kinda catch? Must... find... Finn! Must... must...! PARTY FOREVEEER!!! [Flies away] PAAAAAAARTAHAAAAAAY!!! [Crushes all of the Gnomes when he reaches the Beneathaverse.] PAAARTAAAY!! STEP BACK, EVERYBODY! I'M GONNA SHAKE IT! UNH! UNH! YOU FEELIN' THIS?!? HIGH-FIVE!! [Smashes gun] LET'S KICK IT!! [Kicks Gnomes away; he also kicks the Cyclonic Rodentarod, which bounces into the Plasma Ball, destroying it. The resulting explosion forces Finn's chair off its platform.] HAH-HAH! [Pointing at the Upturnoverdrive] I BET I CAN LIFT THIS THING!! [Tries to lift it, and the machine overheats.] WAAAAHH!!! I did?! And you're okay?! Haha! Then I did it! I saved you by being an unfocused, rowdy party dog! [Prostrates and Finn gets on his back] Hahaha! Yeah! [Stretching towards the exit] Let's go eat Cinnamon Bun! Why does he want your crown anyway, Princess? [taking the phone] Wait a second, Princess. Why don't me and Finn just sneak in there incognito and neutralize the threat, old-fashioned spy guy-style? [to Finn] Okay, I was thinkin' I could [shape-shifts to look like a mailman] dress up like a mailman. Yeah, the shadow thing might be pushin' it. What? But I always wanted to be a mailman. You ready? Hello. Uhh, milkman, sir. I brought the milk—for the hostages, sir. Yes, sir. [starts passing out bottles of milk to the hostages] Milk, sir? Milk? Milk? [to Upside-Down Ice Cream Cone] Some milk? Did you hear that? Yeah. I can do that. Milk? Milk? [approaches Cookie] Milk? [sits next to him] Some milk? Oh, sure. Sorry, man. I was just trying to get away from that rotten Princess Bubblegum for a while, y'know? Isn't she just the worst? Oh, yeah, man, she's the worst. Sittin' out there all safe and cozy while I'm riskin' my life tootin' around in here in this stupid milkman costume. Oh, um... I just mean it feels like a costume... 'cause I wanted to be a mailman so bad, ya see? But the princess—she made me be a milkman anyway. So what's your story, man? How'd she doodie on you? Holy shmow, man. That's terrible. That's really terrible. Listen, I— Yeah, but, maybe she didn't realize how much it meant to you. Whoa, whoa, wait! It doesn't have to be like this! You don't need that crown. You could start over, man. You can start a new kingdom—your own kingdom... where everyone can be whatever they wanna be. I can be the mailman... and you? You can be the princess. And— Yeah, man. Okay, then. Just sit tight, Princess. I'll get us outta here. [walks to the front of the store and waves through the glass doors.] Hey! Hey! I'm comin' out! Don't worry, Princess. It's okay now. Princess Cookie's gonna go away. You just gotta give him a horse to escape with and he'll go. No, wait. He said he'd go away forever. Can't we just let him go? [sighs] [holds him back] Ah-ah-ah! Man, that horse ain't no good; that's a trap horse. It's okay, man, I'm New plan—I'm gonna help Princess Cookie escape. No, man, Princess Cookie's a good guy. He just got dealt a bad hand. He's only trying to be what following how his dreams make you want to be, man! You're either with us or against us. Hold on tight, Cookie! I'm gonna jump the gorge! [still running at full tilt] I can make it! Princess Cookie! Are you all right? No, everything's gonna be fine. I won't let them put you in the dungeon. Just let me talk to them. [runs off] Careful, Princess! [softly] I do? [looks over the ledge] Princess! [to Doctor Princess] Where's Baby Snaps? [walking over to Cookie] Excuse, me! Your highness! Oh, hey. Check it out! [gropes around in his mail bag] Special delivery from the Grass Kingdom! Eeeeeugh... Haha, gross. Stop lying! We found your fingerprints at the crime scene! Uuh... no. Lady don't take my pizza.... Finn? What's— Are you saying Mama? Where'd you— [Looks at Princess Monster Wife] [Stutters] Monster! Where is she? Oh! I think she's right over... Your wife's face can't make us faint anymore! Ouch. Finally... let's get those princess parts back to the ladies. Your shoe rash is gross, man. [Zooms on Finn's shoe rash.] Oh, I'm gonna throw up! [Gags] Ah, I'm just kidding! Don't worry man, we're going to have a ton of fun. We'll eat some melon, I'll get some compliments on my pretty makeup. I look pretty! Thank you. [Gags] I don't like cats, man! [Continues dancing.] Yes. Ha ha! Alright! Huh?! Oh, hey, Gunter. Hey, everybody, Gunter is here! [Everyone says "hey, Gunter" and waves.] [An arrow comes off screen and nearly hits [Laughs] You won a sea lard, that donks — [An arrow lands on Heeey, yooou... Sleds are for suckers. Just ride on my gut. Switch! I'm a flying dog! [They fist tap in midair] Yeah, I know what "Ice King" means A big nerd! Come on, brother! We're just trying to beat the heat. Mmm-hmm! No, no, you do mean "sexy" hot. Uh oh. Yeah, right, sure. Well, why'd you capture six of them if you just want to marry one? Aw, nuts, dude! You broke it when we tried picking the lock to that sad ogre's heart! Don't worry, Finn. I'll get us out of here with Key Hand! Hah-hah! [Uses Key Hand] [Frozen] I... I'm okay. Finn! I'm fine, buddy. Calm down and tend to the princesses. What are you thinking, Finn? Sweet Sweet plan, dude! Because they like it here. Because they like you. Because you're a really fun guy! Whoa, whoa, whoa, Finn, what are you doing? Don't dump the Ice King on me! Oh, eh... Slime Princess, you shouldn't marry Finn. He pees his pants constantly. All the time. [shaped like a tractor, backing up] Beep beep! Look out! Beep beep! Pillow delivery! Look out buddy! [He drops the pillows on Finn.] Sorry buddy, [changes into his normal form] just trying to cheer you up some. I mean here you are chillin' out with history's coolest friends, building an actual pillow fort, but you just sit there sulking--I mean, what gives!? That's it?! A joke? No! Being crazy is hard. You're getting all hung up, all hung up on imaginary problems. You gotta focus on what's real, man. [Grabs a cup.] You see this cup? This is literally my favorite cup. [He throws it through the window, shattering the window.] Now it's gone forever. So it's not real, and I don't care about it anymore. [ [sips the cup] I wonder what Finn's up to... Uhhh, hey BMO, I gotta snag my mug from you. [Removes the wig then puts it on top of BMO's wig.] Hey don't sweat it, I'll make us some hot chocolate. [distorted voice while strangely looking different] You're getting all hung up on imaginary problems, stay with your new wife. You've known her longer now than any of us. You're not even sure if I ever really existed. And I'm pretty sure I didn't look like this. Well, Rainicorn babies age rapidly. They don't need their parents a couple hours after they're born. Mmmmm. Hey buddy, you feeling better already? Really? Yeah, that's great man. Now what about this dream? The dream you were just talking about. Just a second ago! The dream you just had in the pillow fort! [Entering] Heh heh. [Deep voice] Aw, yeah. [Chuckles] Whoa, really?! [Examining] Hmmm... [Knives fall from the clouds and Looks like we're stayin' in today, kid. What's on the menu, BMO? Start it up, BMO! Yeah, they're cool. BMO, that was weak. Ooh, ooh! Dude, I know somethin' totally rockin' we can do! Let's use our imaginations, man! Eh. Your loss. [Beat] AAAH!!! Lava!! Lava all around us!! [Panicking and jumping around] Lava on the floor! Seriously, man! There must be an enchantment on the house or somethin'! NOOOOO!! I was just playin' around with my imagination... [In [To himself] Don't imagine blowin' apart my own brain... Don't imagine my eyeballs coming alive and flying around with rocket packs... I can't! My imagination's too amazing! I can't, dude... but I think I can imagine an imagination turning-off machine... that is upstairs, surrounded by a crud-load of traps, ghosts, monsters, and poison fountains, and... and... girls. Cute girls, and hamsters. You can't hold this baby back! That's bad parenting, mamma! Neat! [Finn and he enter the den] Grab that missile. And... get that cosmic gauntlet. I'm imagining a wall. You can just go around it. Oh, there's one now. [Troll roars] Look out! You're kickin' too high! He's shorter than you! Alright! You're gettin' him, man! [Finn continues attacking] Uh-oh. Now you're uppercutting his family. [Finn kicks in the air and a scream is heard.] Heh heh heh heh heh! You just kicked his wife in the face! [Troll wife yells incomprehensibly.] She's comin' back for revenge. The knife storm, remember?!?! [Finn frantically pulls himself and Okay! [Does it] It is done. I can't imagine a riddle. You exploded the snakes right at us!! I'm sorry, brother! I'm so sorry! AAH! A big bowl of baby elephants, chainsaws, and doo-doo's flyin' towards us!! JUMP, DUDE!! [Finn evades the obstacle.] Here come's a soul-eater! Snap its neck! [Finn jumps up and does so. A weapon is heard charging up. YEAH! Alright. Goin' up. Check it. My imagination-off machine is left of the bed. Yeah, I mean there's a bunch of cute girls... but they shouldn't bother you. Cool, man! [Invisible girl giggles.] Dang, girl. If you weren't a figment of my imagination, I'd want to have your baby. [Another girl giggles.] What're you laughin' at? Dude... I can't see anything... I must've imagined... an invisible monster!! I'm comin', buddy! Alright, Invisibo. Eat a piece of this! [Punches it] Hurry, Finn! Get to the lever! [Completely regular tone] Hello, Finn. I am awake and healthy. I do not know what you mean. I am perfectly bombastic. But Finn, I cannot tell you something amazing as there is nothing amazing happening around us that I could describe for you. One note is all that is needed. True. Doth thou not remember shutting down mine imagination? I am happy that my imagination is gone. It was purposeless. [ [Head shrinks] Aw, man... I imagined my mom naked! [Finn appears next to him.] Yugh! I think so. Lemme check. Mmmm... Yup. She's clothed now. And hey, man! It's clear out now! We can go on an adventure! Huh?! [Body starts melting] AAH! AAH! MY LEGS ARE MELTING! Just kidding. [Chuckles and reforms his body.] [moans] I ate all the candy in your backpack, and now I'm sick. Oh, no. That explains why it didn't taste right. That's how I feel—like a dying parsley. So what's goin' on with the spoon? Marceline and the spoon. It doesn't look like mu—[belches] Oh, my gosh, I feel so much better! Hungry, even. Guys, let's go home! [running off] ♪Let's rock!♪ Sometimes it's better not to know. Hey, guys, look what I found! [starts sinking in the sand] Yeah! [laughs] [tries to get out several times but keeps falling back] Heh. Quicksand is pretty fun. Heh. Okie-doke. Hmm. Hey, is this whole place made out of sand? Uh, give me a pull, please. [stretches his upper body to Finn and Marceline, who grab him and pull] [laughs] Stop, you guys are tickling me! Let me try this other thing. [shapeshifts his body into a corkscrew] Flesh drill! [screams] Yaah! Rug burn! Ow! Ow! Aah! [escapes the quicksand] Whoo! It worked! Check it out! My piggies are free. [wiggles toes] Yeah, only half. Our only exit. No regre-e-e-ets! [tumbles down a hill] I'm sorry. [touches his toe] This little piggie stayed home, and so should have I. I know! I'll dig us out of here. Snacks! I wanna eat snacks... because I am hungry. Bust, bust, bust! Uh-oh. I thought they were candy. Oooh. I'm sorry! [eats cookie] So how hungry are you? Aah! [cowers] I'm sorry. Please don't eat my blood! Like... how crazy? [whimpers] [eats the rest of his cookie] And that will keep you from draining my bloods? [gulps] [whispers] Hurry, Finn. [eating a sandwich] Yo, you know better than that. Don't go crazy, okay? [gulps] Why did you leave me here, dude? [bites sandwich] Oh, my Glob. Oh, my Glob, where are you, man? Marcy's wiggin' out! What? [screams] [screams] [screams] Okay, [pats sand] all done now. Nice and snug, right? [gulps] What? You're sick! C'mon, [laughs] [licks lips] [panting] [digs a lava moat around Marceline] I'm cooking up a crazy vampire! That should heat up nice! The sand will keep the meat moist. You was gonna eat me! [blows lava] Cook, baby, cook! Finn! That's an emerald, dude. This thing is green. You're a little colorblind... and there's nothin' to be ashamed of! I'm sorry you had to push that thing so far. She was threatening to eat my insides, so I'm cooking her. I know that sounds crazy, but I had no choice. I'm operating on my lowest survival brain function right now. What? [looks behind him to see that Marceline is gone] [gasps] No, we gotta book! [pushes Finn into tunnel] Go! [babbles] Yeah, but watch out for Marceline. She's gone rabid! [Snores, wakes up] Hm-huh? Hmm? Oh, yeah... [hugs one in his bed] thanks... Huh? [Penguins grab him, [Struggling with a penguin] Eh... What's with these super penguins? [Getting slapped] Well, where is he, then? [Being crushed] Okay, I give up. [Sees Demonic Wishing Eye] Nice ice! [Sarcastically] Well, that's great. I don't know—lemme see. [Stretches his arm inside and upstairs and brings down a telescope] Whoop! [Looks into telescope] Dang! Hold on. [Looks in another direction] Oh no! NO! [Looks in another direction] Hold on, man. Wait. Oh, Glob! This can't be happening! Eh, it's over. We've been conquered. Everyone. No, dude! By Gunther. [Finn jumps on him, That's not gonna work. You're not gonna tell her the plan? What? I thought you weren't into Bubblegum anymore. OH MY GOSH! Where is this coming from?! Jay T. Dogg—awww, dude! Don't read that book! It's gonna mess up your brain. I keep that book around for laughs. It's all really bad advice. No, well... you can still be mysterious—that's fine. [Arriving at the Candy Kingdom] Never mind—I didn't say nothin'. Uhhh... [Snaps] Oh snap, look out! Breaking news that mystery plan of yours is a smash hit. [Laughs stupidly] Because the—of the glass... I guess all they care about is bottles, huh. So, we make them new bottles. Then the Gunthers break the bottles, and then we pick up the glass and make new bottles again? I like it. I got a rhythm goin'! [Says 'tink' as he reassembles each piece of a bottle] Uh, dude? Where have you been? I dunno. Mayhaps we drank juice of the Elder Toad. Yeah, right. When did we ever did wrong actions? Get real. [takes out his cellphone] I'm callin' BMO, see if he knows what happened. [mutters] Junk... My new camera phone... Wait, c'mere! I guess I vid-taped a buttload of stuff on here. Okay, play. [clicks play button on his phone] Battery crunked out. No, but I guess we're here on purpose? Look! [holds up cellphone and charger] Is there an outlet somewhere for this? Hunson Abadeer? [giggles] Alright. [holding up a banana] And what's up with this? [trying to get the demons' attention] Hey! Hey! Is there an outlet anywhere? You guys... Okay, get on. I think it's like sentient blood mist. C'mon, let's see if anyone knows where Hunson Abadeer is. Okay. [holds up the banana] Hey, do you know about this? [looking at the boat demon] That guy stinks. I... can't. I got nothing to say anymore. Bloobity bloo bloo blah blee blee blah. Shree shrah... Hey, check it out. We're at the front of the line. 41 million... [mutters gibberish] We're next! Whew! Man, I thought I was gonna throw up! Yaaay! [sees that there is another extremely long line] Nooooooo! Hey, do you know if there's an outlet anywhere? Do you know what this is all about? [holds up banana] What's going on, buddy? You givin' up? You don't wanna just stick it out a little more? Listen, Finn. Are you listening? Your heart may be small, but it's strong as a bull donk. And I know. You can wait through this line so we can meet Hunson Abadeer and find out why we're here, and why we're in a pile of banianials, 'cause you're a champ, OK? 上手で頑張ってね ("Being that you are skilled you can do it!") That's it, champ. [Finn starts to jog in place] Hehehehe, you're pretty pumped up. [gasps] Put your hand down, Finn! It's not answering questions, man. That thing is gonna bake our beans. [Points to cloud] Look. Ride me, partner. [ We just wanna go home, man. Ah, come on, man! Finn! We don't want to hurt you, Abadeer. Just let us go. [groans] Alright, but I'm gonna take a shower first. That paper crane for Princess Bubblegum? Heh. I bet you wish you were my butt. I bet you wish you were my butt, because then the princess would... No, wait... I bet you wish you were the Ice King and the princess was my butt! Hmm... [Snapping] OH! I bet you wish Bubblegum would kiss you, too! Like the Ice King and my butt! Hahahaha! Who's ready to party?! If you wanna dance, just go dance! Huh, it sounds like you're dealing with some new emotions you don't understand... like jealousy. Look, man, just go out there and get down! [Pushes him onto the dance floor] Do the Science Dance! Remember it? It was sorta like this. [Does it] Wah unh we ah eeh... Yeah! Probably. [Pushes him back onto the dance floor] Do it, man! You're a pro! [To himself] Woof! Man... This is goin' bad. Hey, Finn. You gotta come help me slay these peanut monsters at the bar. It can't wait. [He and Finn are alone.] Wow, man, what happened out there? Yeah. Ladies are twisty, man. Bubblegum's super smart, too. Why? Is it because his face is so foldy and dramatic? Maybe what you feel is romantic rivalry. How? Lemme see. [Gets binoculars] I can read their lips. [Mimicking Princess Bubblegum] "Hey, shorty, you should pick your boogers and then fart!" [Mimicking Ricardio] "You look kind of like a big pink baguette!" Is it? Don't get me wrong. I'm all about stakeouts and spying on this guy, but what if he's not a villain? What if he just looks wicked? Some people look wicked but are super nice. [Grabbing gut] Hmm. So... he's recycling... or what? So I was right! He is a good guy who's just cursed to look suspicious! [To gut] You and me, gut! Together forever! Solvin' crimes and makin' up rhymes! Or good! Or nice with an evil face? Yeah, we just wanna know if you're evil or not. Yeah. [Slightly annoyed] Yes! Hold up, Finn! The Ice King looks sorta damaged! Princess Bubblegum!! I don't wanna watch an old man die on Princess Bubblegum's carpet, man. Wakey, wakey, wake. Mmm, when you're right you're right. Um, we were at home last night. That was a great thing we were doing at home with no other witnesses. Princess Bubblegum? She's right around the corner. Oh princess Bubblegum! [tries to imitate her] Yes? [normal voice] I think some banana guards want to speak with you. Hey, Root Beer Guy. You were not supposed to view this tape. Hey, this looks kinda personal. [yawns] Happy birthday, Finn. What? No. My prank is this fake-out gift. Huh? What's this guy's deal? [Shouts] [Groans] Aw. Owiee. Yes. It's an invisible shield. That's right! Yay, yay! Now's our chance, BMO. He's got this. He's 17. [Flips the paper upward to reveal some writing] "I'm not talking today" [it states.] [He gives the paper a little shake to emphasize the intent.] [Begins writing on a new paper. He flips it over] "When did you make your sign?" [Replies with] "You fancy a wager, buddy?" [Hops out of his bed and onto Finn's with papers in hand.] [Flips his newly written message,] "So, what are the stakes?" [He waits for Finn's reply.] "Can we use signs?" [Pushes his plate away to shuffle through his signs, he finds the one he wants and flips it over,] "What's your favorite part?" [it states,] [he flips another sign] "... of the breakfast, I mean". "the juice?", "the toast?", "the jam?". [By this point Finn gives an annoyed stare and shuffles through his signs some more, looking for a response. "You didn't write enough signs, did you dummy?" [Becomes agitated and crossing his arms and baring his teeth, he rapidly shakes his head. He then bops Finn on the head and covers his mouth as well as his own.] [They both look back to BMO.] [Dashes to the kitchen table to pick up a sign] "I'm going in there". [He then looks through a box to find a headlamp, he quickly goes back to his signs and with a look of suspicion to Finn, he picks one up and flips it over] "Don't touch my signs". [Coming out of the hole and walking up to Finn, he frowns when he sees his signs have been touched.] [When [Picks up two signs] "Oh dang, the toast?", [he tosses them and walks off.] [Taps his forehead and expresses that he has an idea.] [Points to his nose.] [Shifts his hand to become bigger and pounds on the wall.] Ow, ow! Okay fine! Uncle uncle, please stop pinching me Bikini Babe!. Whoa! [Marceline does a slam dunk] Yeah! What you are talking about, Marceline? Yeah, lay it out, Marcy! Pretty heavy Heck yeah! We’re home. What about when you got trapped in a mind dungeon for a buncha years? Yeah, I’m burnt out. No more adventure for a while, okay? Yes, yes, yes! Let’s go take hot showers! Yeah. We gotta get to the bottom of this hot shower. Home always looks different after a long trip. You’re seeing it with fresh eyes and newfound wisdom. And sometimes there’s also a new strip mall or something. So, everything being pink is probably not a big deal, and also, I’m tired. Haha, yeah, why you worry so much, worry baby? Woah! What the heck happened to the tree house? Oh, okay, I get it. We’ve obviously stumbled into another alternate dimension where everyone’s a different version of themselves. Yawn. Wow, gummy Shelby’s a lot of fun. I think I’m okay with candy world. Hey, I want some of that! Stop striding! It just keeps you agitated. What I’m hearing is, you’re stressed out because everything’s candy. Not really. Lemongrab’s always been a weirdo. At least now he’s helping people. And Fern is, like, laughing and joking around. Maybe they don’t need you to fix them. Sweet P., do you remember what happened? Hmm. Okay, you’re right. This is pretty freaky-deaky. And never be the guy with no phone, Finn. You’ll think it’ll make people wanna talk to you more, but people just forget to invite you to things. Ooh. Something smells nice. Nice and toasty. Get it, get it, get it, get it! We gotta get out of here before- Cloud Kingdom. Finn...You gotta see this. BMO, turn the music down. BMO! Turn it down! [Groans] Come on, BMO you're messing up my game! Hey, dude, can I borrow that paper? [Whistles; rolls up paper; hits BMO with it] Bad computer! No! No! [Music stops.] Now go sit in the corner and think about your life. Ugh! Hold on! [Stretches his arm and grabs a saltshaker] I got this! [Grunts, brandishes saltshaker] Don't make me use this, man! I think our house is all jacked up. Yeah. Okay, let's help him. But he's got to lay off the house. Lay off the house, man! I don't know, but you're probably going to say... Just do whatever you want, man, as long as it comes from the inside. You keep that stuff inside you, brother. You just got to talk to 'em. Finn, you see any hot mamas? Go talk to her! Go talk to her! He's got this. Relax. I got it. Snorlock! Hey, Snorlock. You okay, buddy? Went a little nuts there, guy. You got to get that under control, 'cause you're scaring ladies and jacking up our house. Aw, who could leave you? Come here, you big hot mess. [Hugs] Yeah, the ladies. No, it's not. Check it out, Snorlock. Finn, you be the guy snail, and I'll be... [Shifts to appear like a lady snail] the chick snail. Come on, man. We're just pretending. Do it for love. [High-pitched voice] Well, I'm just sitting here thinking about mating with snails. [Normal voice] We're just role-playing, buddy. Here, Finn. This time you be the chick and I'll be the snail dude. [Shifts into Guy Snail; flexes pecs] Hey, baby. What's up? Mm-mmm! [Sniffs Finn's hand] mm-mmm! [Deep voice] Girl, you smell good. Did you take a bath in rainbows and cupcakes? Say "yes"! [High-pitched voice] Say "Yes"! [Deep voice] Say "YES"! [High-pitched voice] Say "Yes"! [Normal voice] See, Snorlock? Talking to ladies is easy. Just act like me. Aw, it's okay, buddy. Come here and give us a hug. Stay focused, Snorlock. You have any cool talents that ladies might like? Umm, hey, Finn, teach him how to use swords. The princesses always love this one. Do you think you can do that, Snorlock? Hmm. Maybe you're musical. Can you do this? [Inhales deeply, begins beatboxing] Try doin' all that. Yeah, Snorlock! Show us that talent! Let's just let Snorlock do his thing. Go to it, buddy! [Grabs Finn and sits on top of observatory boat] Look at him go! Bringing in the ladies. Wedge, dude! [Grunting] It's no use, man. It's stuck with snail slime. Finn! Aah! [Also gets shoved back and forth between the Snail Ladies] [ [Runs and then jumps into the house window] Hmph! Snorlock, I'm gonna give you till the count of three, mister! One, two, three! Fine. I didn't want to have to do this. [Taps out a single grain of salt onto his palm] [Inhales deeply and then blows it in Snorlock's direction] Snorlock, you never had a shell? That means you're not naked. You're a slug! I don't know why they have to make out so close to our house. Yeah. You live here, too! Yeah, you think you're pretty way up there but I can get you! [he stretches to be on Lady's level.] Whoa! Dude, what's up? Whooo! Tell me about what, dude? [Chuckles] Alright, what's going on? Hey, dude. I think you and Bubblegum are up to something. Whoa, you guys are up to something. Is it some sort of prank? Can I get in on it? Hmm... [Shoulders Finn] Hey seriously, man. I'm your bro. Bros are supposed to tell bros everything all the time. What are you and Bubblegum up to? Is everything alright? Truth. I can't eat chocolate or fudge 'cause I'm a dog and they'd probably kill me, but hmmmmm probably... neither. Finn! Truth or dare? I dare you... to tell me the truth about what's going on in your mind. What were you and Bubblegum talking about when you were alone together? I'm not playing dodge socks 'til you stop dodging my questions. Hey... [Sniffs socks] Old Mr. Cream Puff? Isn't he dead? Whoa. [angrily] Look dude, just tell me what's up, 'cause you are crazier than a cannonball tonight. What? You lost me. Adventure time? Really? Okay, okay, alright. [Closet door closes on Whew! Seven minutes up yet? [Grabs a jelly filled doughnut and eats it, noticing the zombie corpses.] Whoa! [Runs to Finn] What the nuts happened here?! Really!? This is messed up, but sweet. Starchie! [Walks over to Finn] Man, you broke a Royal Promise? You're nuts. All you had to do is say that it was a royal secret. I know what's up. [Walks away from Finn.] It's an ugly scene, man. Whoa! Wait, wait! [Stops] Shh, shh, shh! Shush! You hear that? [Long beat] It was totally silent for, like, a whole second! Sometimes, we get so wrapped up battling stuff, we forget the...Ooomph! [as Magic Man] Well, you guys are missing some important details. I'm Yeah, that's true, except I'm not Magic Man! Whoa. That second one sounds pretty cool. I mean, yeah. I'm way into that. Except...oh...I would really miss my best friend. His name is Finn, and I think it would mess him up if I wasn't around. Yeah. [in real world] [moans] Huh? Hey, I'm alive! [stretches his ear back through the door] He said his new prison is shame. I'm staring because I can't move my head. No, really, I can't move. What's happening?! Hey! Who is that? [Straining] Ooooh... [sees Ice King] Ice King! So why can't we move? Why are you doing this, Ice King? You tried to kill us, like, four times. Just unfreeze us now, man. Mm-hmm. Um, ooh, uh... rainbow? Wha—? Don't touch my lemons, Ice King! Ice King! [Gasps] Gunter! No, Gunter! No! No! Gunter! No! What're we gonna do?! What? Noooo! No, no, no, no, no! I can't take this any more! Dang it, Finn! What are you doing in there? [Quietly] Key! Gunter. Gunter. Psst! Pssssst. Come here, Gunter. [Makes kissing noises.] [Whispering] Grab it, Gunter. Pick it up! [Gunter reaches for the key] Pick it up!! [Gunter gets closer] What are you waiting for? Just grab it! [Quietly] Gunter! Come back. [Quietly] Gunter. Gunter, wake up. [Gunter wakes up] Go... get... the... key. [Gunter starts playing with Wait, you're sleeping up here?! Uh, yeah, my girlfriend? Lady Rainicorn? [Sarcastically] You don't say. What? [Groans] He fell asleep with his eyes open. Finn! Finn, snap out of it! I'm hungry. That sounds pretty good, actually. Dude, you're back! Where's your Astral Beast? What kind of beast? A gorilla, huh? [Butterfly lands on Hey, come on now, you're not the worst. No, you're not! You're the best! [Strains] I'm using my enhanced brain sense to tell your astral beast to slap some sense into you. [Strains] No... you... don't! [moaning sickly] Blankie me. Blankie me, Finn! Right here. [touching the blanket on right side of his bed] Because I'm sick! [making a shriveled face] Too hot! [pushes the blanket off] URGGH! Soup me, Finny. Yes. [ No! I already heard that story before. Make me a new one, Finn. A new story. Nooo! [ I don't want a made-up story. I need a real story. Oh my gosh! What is it? Spit it out. Oh no, now I feel a thousand times worse. Finn, a story's gotta have excitement, romance... [his eyes turn shiny] ...suspense, [dragging out the word and pulling his eyelids down] and it has to have a happy ending. [sniffs] That's okay, buddy. Just dig me a hole and -- actually, two holes. One for my guts and one for my face, 'cause when I die, my guts are gonna blow outta my face. Then go get me that story. [pulls out a paper] And make sure it has all the stuff on this list. And then what happened? [coughs] Huuuuuuuuh!!! That was... [he stretches his arms and legs and shakes them] perfect! I feel a million times better! Yeah! The romance stopped my fever... the suspense cured my headache... and everything else cured everything else! I'm not sick, I'm not sick! [dancing] Finn, c'mon! Dance the health dance with me. You allergic to my health dance? Ohhhh... Finn, did you catch my sick? The end. [turns the lights off] Yeah, man, it'll be fun! [Shrinks and gets in Finn's hand] Toss the Again, man! Ow!! Whoa... I don't think this is a stump. A hatch? [He jumps on it and opens the lid.] We should check it out, ya think?! [He jumps down.] [Excitedly] Waaah! What a dump! [Finn's flashlight goes out. He tries to get it working again.] Can you imagine the jerks that musta lived here? We could rule them... like gods! [Deviously] ...Angry gods... [Whispering] Shh. They're startled. Ya gotta be gentle with wild animals. I don't know, man. Maybe they just don't know any other thing. Well, let's bring 'er up! Ooooh! Mah back!! Oop. Ya killed 'er. Yep. Felled by surface-world germs. [Susan starts scurrying with her face still planted in the ground. Finn scowls at [Semi-French pronunciation] Patience... That's just a rock. [Punching it away] A low-level enemy. Golden as a wheaty sunset! How's yours? Heh. That's adorable. Hup! Dang... She is way into candy. You know, she may be too excited about candy. So now what? Fight the humans to the death when they attack? [Whispering to Finn] They're doomed. Ahh, these candy weapons are too cute to be scary. Aw, so cute! I just wanna give them candy! I don't think that'll scare anybody... [Running up to Finn] Hey, buddy! We did it! Finn? You okay? [Beat] We're all wild animals, brother. It's a cure-all! Oh, yeah, that makes sense. [belches] Oh, sorry, last one. Hey, now! I pride myself in having nice-smelling burps. Just kidding. That ain't true, PB. Marcy took a risk, and you helped her because you're her friend. Real friends take each other to the edge of death—'cause death is life! Right, Finn? Gross! What if they're, like, her boogers... or worse? Ew, ew, ew, ew! Sometimes I think vampires were invented just to torment me. I'm just saying it's a possibility. See?! I hate it! What it this, some hut the Moon plopped out of her bod? Still hate it. What's that, pickles? Ew. Yeah, that's her. Shouldn't she, like, explode or something? Oh, yeah. How are we supposed to destroy this stay-fresh creep? Man, we've been doing this for hours. Wait. "Taking" or "staking"? She said "you guys, 'sztake' her back. " So which one should we do? Whoops. Get her back in the vase! What?! Dude, for real, why'd you make her chase us? Shoot, just don't let her near my deli tray! Okay. No, bro, just let me run! I don't need a play-by-play, man! What do you mean?! Why do you think that? No, boy, you crazy! Okay, my life is in your hands, man! Stop hitting my butt! That's her voice?! But she said I'm running in her light! What do we do? You gonna try something? What was that?! "Tap out"? When do you ever tap out? I can't! I feel like I'm in a slow-motion terror dream! Finn. Finn, she's dead. Space what-y? Hey everybody. [Laughs] Hey, what's with the hair, brudda? [Laughs] Nice. Beats me. I was just eating a sausage on some stupid planet, then all of a sudden there was a beautiful rainbow explosion and a loud noise - sort of like a space telemetry capsule activating. Then here I was, standing next to this Mars door. Me! Yeah! Nah, it's a Snow Golem, man. I think he's laughing. Oh, yeah, big time. Yup. [getting massaged by BMO] Here we go. They're probably gonna try to lure us on some dumb trip. Oh. [Reading a ninja manual] And if I do this hand position, [he positions his hand] my boogers should turn into smoke bombs. Relax, Restless Pants. A true ninja can sense the intentions of his enemies. [He shifts his ears into a symbol] Jin. Yep, ever since we fished this ninja manual out of a ditch. Finn, booty me! Finn, I think I'm gonna take off my booties. I can't flip these pages. Uh-oh. If the Ice King's so happy, he must have stolen a princess when we weren't looking, somehow. [covers his mouth with his ears] That's ninja logic. You got it, shino-bro! Ninja kick! [Sniffs the floor and raises an armchair with his arm like a jack] Princess? [Looking in the toilet] Princess? ...Ahh... No princess here, man. Nothing is trapped, dude. We can't find any captured princesses, because the Ice King hasn't captured one yet. He's out doin' it right now. [confident] No. It's only a ninja hunch, so we should ninja snoop for proof. [Pulls out a book from under a pillow on the bed] Whoo! Got the Ice King's diary. And yet we must. [clears his throat and takes the form of the Ice King] Dear diary—and you better write me back this time!— [not actually reading] today I'm bringing home a special new cutie. Or... we could keep looking through his stuff. Heh, heh, heh! You know, for more proof? Hehehe! Where are we gonna hide? Nah. Hey, Finn, I don't want to hide in the hamper anymore; it reeks in here. Nah, man. My sense of smell is, like, one thousand times better than yours. Also, the hamper's boring. I'm out. I'm out! Check this out! I want to draw something. I'll delete it after! What kind of guy builds a cave inside of another a cave? [Goes to a book] What's this? A spellbook? [Turns the pedestal] Whoo! Ah, it's too late for that. What'cha got there? [in the manual] I ain't even heard of these techniques. [He makes a symbol with his hand] Nuh-nuh-n-numm-nuh [Summons ice nunchucks on his hand.] numb-chucks. [Twirling the nunchucks] Yeah, so? [He hits himself with the nunchucks.] Nah, they're still cool. But Ice King's still lame because he hides his ninja love. We wear our ninja on our sleeves! [Breaks a cabinet with nunchucks] [Also making hand positions] Fridjitsu master Hyah! [Kicks icicles] Icicle kick! [Evades the snow with a jump] Flying jump! [Behind Finn] Heh! Fridjitsu master Hai! Thin ice, thin ice, thin ice! [Turns 2D and disappears] Ooh, right. Yeah, the one you just came back from stealin'. Gunther's a woman?! [inhales through his teeth] [laughs] A couple of ninjas like me and Finn can only be defeated by another ninja! Oof! [He replaces the door] Yeah, man, just don't croak out here. [Orgalorg shifts into a huge yellow being with sharp ends.] Hey, man, look at Gunter. Whoa. That's pretty. [turns to look at Finn] Looks good, right? Man, are you still Gunter? 'Cause you seem like you're not. Ohhh, I know about open door philosophy! Pretty much. [pointing to Orgalorg] He made it ugly. Okay. Shoot. Hey, stop drifting! Ooh, maybe I can use jet propulsion! [passes gas and clutches at his helmet] Oh no, I can't breathe! You okay, Finn? Well, I was just floatin' around, and I drifted into B-Man's flight path. Pretty random— [Banana Man nods] —right? [with Finn now in the ship as well] Let's get the jazz outta here. This stinks! Hey, how much longer till we get to the mysterious party? What's it say? I'm Randy Butternubs. [Walks away and throws card on ground] Tut-tut, Lumpy Space Princess! What would your boyfriend Brad say? No. Yeaaaaah, right. [Walks over to Cinnamon Bun's skeleton] Come on. You don't remember when I pulled the same trick on your birthday? [Picks up Cinnamon Bun's skull.] I used the fake skeletons. [Makes Cinnamon Bun's mouth move the same time he is speaking.] To make you think everyone was dead. [Blows small raspberry] Classic move. What do you mean "Hmmm?" Let's find some candles. If the lights go out again, we'll be able to catch the murderer! Okay. Lay truth on me BMO, is Finn pulling some elaborate prank on me? Ooh! [Laughs maniacally.] Thanks, BMO! BMO? BMO? AHHH! [Runs back up the stairs to the foyer.] Oh my crease! Oh my crease! Assemble! Reassemble! Come on you guys! The ghost got 'im! [worried] It sounds like she's in there! [Points to a door behind them.] Chill out, girl. [to Finn] You find any candles upstairs? Well, I dropped a lighter downstairs, but there's no way I'm going back for that. Someone at this table isn't who they appear to be! [matter-of-factly] A half-orc shaman. [interrupting] Why did you break up with Brad? Only the real LSP would know that! You're right. I'm just feeling gossipy and I wanna know what happened. [accusing] You're not PB! Tie you up! Aha! [taps Finn's face] I knew you were pranking me back, you! [turning and noticing the painting] Look! [Finn walks over.] [whispering] I'm scared, bro. RUN, HOMIE, RUN! It won't open! [He taps the door with his left hand, enlarges his right and punches the door. He then holds his hand in pain.] [groggily] Okay... [hopping in pain] Ow, ow, ow! I got a splinter! Don't let go, man! [removing the white sheet covering him sitting on Lady Rainicorn 's head.] Haha! Gotcha, dude! Two for two! I figured out your plan months ago! So I flipped the script. Oh yeah! Yeah, see?! The what? Eh, nah. You must have been so scared you imagined that part. Haha, nice try, Finn. Let's get outta here. Come on, Finn! Let me hear that war cry! Finn, this ain't workin'. It's just fart grabbin'. Also, we got you crosswords, "sudukus," and connect-the-dots. Just take her easy, buddy. Later, Vampire Queen! Aw, don't worry about him. It's good to be passionate about your hobbies. Yo, T.V.! Get me a chocolate bar! Attaboy! [Preparing to eat,] There you go, just need a little push from the old man. [Coughs.] Bam! [Slaps down three more cards.] Bam! [Slaps down the remaining four.] Bam! Lady, you're really off your game. I never win at canasta! You said you wanted the kid to spend more time outside. Bam--He's outside. He's loving it! If it'll make you feel better then yes, but I'm sure he's fine. Uh-oh. Uh, son? Uh, close enough. T.V., what is that? Gimme the book. [He pulls it away from T.V. with some effort.] [Opens the book.] A diary, huh? Juicy. [Flips through the pages.] And now you've become dangerously obsessed with it, and have confused your reality with that of the diary keeper. [Turns to T.V., who looks at the book over Ooh, ripped pages! Mystery. That's super weird, son. She was obviously emotionally distraught. Maybe she was so stressed she broke out in hives! And they covered her whole body. So they rushed her to the hospital. She was thinking, "oh man I'm so young," and how life is so unfair, and that this was the end. But it wasn't the end. She had pulled through. Except her hand had been replaced with a crab hand! Which negatively affected her handwriting. Wait... you refused? [Shocked,] He did not! [Opens the diary.] Well, that's one theory, anyway. Hey, did you say Love Tree Point? That's where the kids used to go smoochin' back in the day. This diary must be pretty old. We should go check it out. Ugh, this place is a dump. Because of that tree over there. Yeah, it's pretty heavy-handed. Hey, good thinking! Bingo! Yeah... B.P. would have love this. Justin must have been too devastated to reclaim it. Maybe he thinks she'll come back for it one day. [He twists to look out over the water.] She never knew how much she meant to him. To all of us! Y'know, son, I bet I know where this music box is from. Maybe they can give us a clue. Okay...Well, we gotta go. Who was it meant for? Woah. Hard to say. [He changes slowly back to his normal shape as he walks.] Some people can't face their troubles. But T.V., hiding away won't solve anything. Ah, teachable moment. It's a model. It's plastic. [Waving the skeleton's hand,] "Heeyyy." Hey, look at this! Maybe we shouldn't read this... Wow. B.P. is Nurse Poundcake. She turned out fine! Oh, I saw them in the cabin. It was just a lot of mean stuff about Justin. [Chuckling,] Hey, that guy must be pretty sad, huh? Hey, you wanna go find him? Here, try throwing this one. [ I have no idea. But it's probably best to stay out of it. Uh-oh... [while laughing] Oh boy. I'm sorry! I can't stop now. Two witnesses! Heheh. She's completely bonkers. Don't worry! [elbows Finn lightly] That won't happen. We're gonna catch that Duke! Dude, look. The Duke of Nuts is bad guys. Think about it. If Bubblegum hates him so much, then he must have done some rotten stuff. I mean, maybe he even threw a bottle and turned someone ugly before. Maybe I am! Nah, we're more like cops. Crooked cops! [ How are you? [ Woah! What?! You believe that? She is nuts. Listen, man. Let's just go back and face the music. Who cares if Bubblegum hates you forever? It's no biggie. Tons of people hate me! I went left too! Dude. That's not him. That's the Duke of Nuts. Just because he's a good father, doesn't necessarily mean he isn't a villain. I can probably think of a reason why that's villainous if you gave me enough time. Maybe. Hey man, it's not that bad being hated. What happened to the cup? [behind bush while shaking the bush] Rustle. Rustle, rustle. [ Oh, [out of character] Did I come out to early? I've come for the princess. I'm an assassin! Hi-yah! I will kill you! And raise your children as my own! Hah! [while running towards Princess Bubblegum] Sorry, dude! [ Go, go, go, go! [jumping out of bush] Yeah, alright! [yawning and talking to an oval-shaped member of royalty] Buy a lady a drink? ...nope. Vampiyah, I'm gonna kick yah Vampiyah, I'm gonna lick yah Vampiyah Aah! Uh-oh. It's P.B.'s outside clock! Yeah, I need relief. P.B. still working on new vampire-busting gear? Patted my laps and made some rhymes. Stoop, stoop, sittin' on the stoop Stoop, stoop, sittin' on the stoop I heard a loud snap, and my vampire-hunting reflexes kicked in! Yeeegh! She doesn't have to know I broke the clock. Let's blame it on the vampires! Or we can hide it! Whoo! Problem solved? Yeah? Whooop! Oh! I know, Finn! I know! [Laughing] Aaaaadventure time? [Sniffs] Enchiridion is... [sniffs more, points] That way. It's in the castle on top of the mountain. [Sniffs] In a room. [Laughing and tapping his nose] Wish you had one, huh? What about the book? Yo, Finn. Are you alright? Did you get brain damage? Hey! Back off, you gnomes! That kid just saved you guys! You should thank him, not destroy old ladies! Do you even know what I'm talking about? Say thank you! Say... Thank... You. [Shoving the gnomes back into the lava pit] Get back in there! Hey, Finn. You okay? Awww. Don't let those gnomes and their illusions get you down. They're just gnomes and illusions. Yeah, man. Think. What would regular, old, sweet ladies be doing wandering the hills of Mount Cragdor? [Laughing] No way. This place is designed to mess you up. To mess with your head. None of this is real. It's all just trials to test your heroic attributes. Now let's go get that book. [Popping out of the ogre's nostril] It's ok, Finn! I can get out! [Popping out of the ogre's ear and laughing] Don't worry, dude! I found another way—oof! Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa-oa! [Laughingly] Stomachs are weird. Dude! You just flew us all the way to the top! Wait a minute. [Sniff] I can smell the book right through this door. You know what that was? That was righteous. You got it! [Laughing] Hey! Crack open that book and read something for fun's sake, alright? Whoa. What'd you just read? [getting a banana] Dude, we've been up for like seven days. Yeah, for real-sies! [Flashback begins.] Remember? First, we rescued the Slime Princess from the Ghost Ship Vortex. And then we slayed that fire dragon. And that took a couple of days. Then, we captured that Bandito. Saved the house... And fed that duck. We've had a busy week. Good night, buddy. Yeah? No. Yeah, what's going on with that? Man, I just wanna go to sleep. Not gonna be able to sleep with that horse watchin' me. Outta sight and outta mind. See 'ya in the morning, pal. All right, man. Let's just go...push it off that hill or something. Hey! Get out of here, horse! I want to go to sleep, and you're creeping me the math out! Forget it, man. This horse is whack. It's got poo-brain. I'm super-pulling! I didn't wanna have to use my powers on you, horse, because I'm so sleepy. But you've pushed Let's get back to bed, buddy. I wanna marry my bed. No more.... NO MORE! I have an idea! [runs up to the horse, and flakes a blindfold on his face] I did it! Ha-ha! He can't stare at us if he's blind! Wh..why?! Stupid blindfold! What's your deal, screwy?! Why are you messin' with us, huh?! Yeah, I know, Finn. I diagnosed this horse with whacked out poo-brain five minutes ago. That's true! You're a genius! [goes to get his viola] All right horse, prepare to be lured! [walks off and plays Beethoven's, "Moonlight Sonata"] Follow me, Horsey. Huh! Hmmm. [plays Symphony No. 5 in C minor] So, Beet-hoven's not luring enough for you, is it? Well, how about some Mozzart?! [plays Mozart's "Eine Kleine Nachtmusik"] Huh? Oh, nuts. Let me try and lure a mongoose! [starts playing, "Ride of the Valkyries"; Finn throws No! Ahh! [sighs] Dude... let's kill the horse. I'm so tired, Finn! Okay, we won't kill the horse. We'll dress him up like a bunny! Ha-ha! And get a giant hawk—Caaaww!--To kill him! Caaawww! Caaawwwwww! Eh. Did I say that the hawk would kill him? I meant that the hawk would swoop down gently and take him away to an island of sunshine and love-stuff and, take care of him. What do think? Grab a good hold and fly away! Good night, buddy. That's obvious, Finn! You don't have to say that out loud! You're just mad at me for being...handsome? Well, you're the one who told me to lure snakes! Ahhh! Aw, man.. you're right! We have to get rid of this horse, for us! Oh, Finn; this horse is bringing us together now. This horse is a blessing. You...wait, wait. [crying] The horse is tearing us apart again! What are you going to do? What are you going to do?! Oh, my Grod! He was trying to learn our bedtime secrets! [gasps] He was! Did you find out that I sleep "in the nude"? It's none of your business how nude I sleep, Ice King! Nnnnone of your business! Here's your sword, dude! Tell us why you were spying! Quick! Throw them to the Ice King! He's using his ice powers. Yeah and make it quick 'cause we're both really sleepy. Huh? So, you dressed up like a horse? Yes, sir, son! I wonder what it could be. Maybe it's a teenage silverware werewolf squatter. Ghosts, huh? Whoa, wait! What if it's... I'll go get tulips for Mom! Man, I've never been this excited about ghosts before. And show 'em that their kids are awesome. Hello? Ghosts? If you're in here, please vacate my son's property! Yeah, in that case, I brought flowers! [Pots the flowers] I'll sniff 'em out. [Sniffing] I dunno. Kim Kil Whan is a good businessman. Plus I'd feel kinda weird dealing with this stuff. It was right over there! And over here you gave me a wet willie one time. Right. I know you believe that's true, but memories distort over time. Classic false memory syndrome. Classic false memory syndrome response. [With enlarged ears] Way ahead of you, pal. Uh... over there! [He runs over to the bathroom and barges in.] Aha! [There's nothing there, and the ticking has stopped.] Nope. This is a nice bathroom, though. Man, this whole office is nice. It's kinda bunk how Mom and Dad stopped using it. We were babies forever. [Exiting the bathroom] Yeah, but they knew what they were getting into. Whoa! Who moved the sofa? Who put forth those chairs?! Who set the table?! What's going on?! But I don't want that. Look! I'll take the bathroom! The bathroom is a lot scarier than I was expecting. Scared? No way! I'm primitive! I'm real! Ghosts, you can't touch this dog! You've got ethereal hands! I'm alive! I'm filled with hot blood! You'll never see through me! [He bursts into the bathroom again.] Gotcha, ghoul! Aah! Oh, sorry for interrupting your poop. [ [Screams and exits again.] I gotta get out of here! No, Huh? [He looks out the window.] Dad? [Enters] Finn! I'm freaking out, man! I just saw the most messed-up thing! Dad? That's so not how I was birthed! I'm no melon baby! I'm a majestic womb baby! I'm gonna go hog-wild on the next ghost I see! Aah! [He exits.] We're trapped in a ghost trap! One of the dudes that escaped Dr. Gross' menagerie. Yeah, I'm pretty disgusted with the whole situation! That doesn't sound scientific! Wait, I'm still confused! And having feelings! If this was all time weirdness, I guess that memory was true. I did see my own birth. Far out. [ We're doin' what now? C'mon, let's go look for that creep! So, you got some sleek new shades, and now everything's different? You smell with your beard? Lame. I know! I almost told him 'cause it was driving me nuts! Do you think he's got evil intentions behind his reborn star-child act? Yeah, me too. Aw, hey, that's cute. [while picking up a weapon] Hmm. This one's a letter from the hospital. Yeah, I learned braille from my ex. Nah, just cool. [reading off of tablet] "Dear Xergiok, thank you so much for your donation. The kidneys fit great." [stops reading] Well, geez, maybe he has changed his ways! Shush, child! Finn! What are you doing, man? Are you sure? Alright, tell him. Your eyes weren't stolen by a wizard. They're in your beard. Sure, okay. [ You were in the desert a long time, man. Nah, it was more like one year and change, dude. Whisper Dan. Uh, wait. Xergiok, this is the Goblin Kingdom. Oh, dang! [ You lost your friends, dude. Are you gonna be alright, man? Nah, man, he's fine. [panting] Remember last time we were out this way? It was right after you messed things all up with Flame Princess. No, it wasn't. Okay, hold on. Let me get out my sidewalk chalk. I want to write all over the walls in there. Finn? Fi-inn! Finn? Where are ya, buddy? Finn! There you are. Again? You just got here, son. What cave? Well, I followed your map, but there's just a bunch of grass here. And then the whole thing disappeared. But I wonder how come I don't remember any of it. Okay, well... Good night, buddy. So, been almost a month now. What do you think? You wanna try opening 'em? It's beautiful day. Plus, I need someone to tell me if this hat looks cool. Yeah, that makes sense, I guess. So, um, I got you a little something, a little present. You're really gonna thank me. Gotcha! Well, shoot, man. If I wanna do it that bad, it must be kinda right, right? Look at it from where I'm sitting. All this funky pizzazz that only you can see, that's like the literal definition of a hallucination, either all that stuff is a dream or like, I'm a dream. And I ain't no dream, ya heard? Whoa! That must have been some cave! I don't know... I'm getting bit up by something. I said it might be good. It's not, though. Wanna just go? [Turning around] Oh, whoa! [Disgusted] Bleehhh! Aw! Ehhh! Whoa, relax, buddy! You're talkin' to the right couple of guys. That's nice! Thanks, man. [Sniffing] Hmm. Yeah, but it's hard to make out. Could just be some footprints... or an old doodie. Yeah, that's a great idea, man. I was just gonna throw 'em all on the ground anyway. [Drops a lollipop while walking] Whomp. [Drops another] Whomp. [Drop] Whomp. [Drop] Whomp. [Sniffs the air and points] This way. [The two climb a fallen log bridging a ravine] The thing with frogs is they got a real subtle smell. Kinda like when you open up a new thing of, um... CDRs. Yeah... but subtler. [They come across a large footprint] Mm-HMM! Just as I suspected. Oh, yeah. Word. [Sees footprints overlapping and facing different directions] Wait, these prints are all messed up! [Holds up empty bag] We ran out of those a while ago. What? Nah, man! Frogs are mighty dumb, you know that. He's probably runnin' around like that 'cause he's lost! [Laughs] Plus, we're not even lost. I just gotta stretch up past these trees and see where we're at. [Stretches head above canopy] Dang. It's all misty! It's kinda nice up here, though. [Lightning strikes his head, screams as he stretches back down] AAAAAAAAH! Man, forget that! I can't see anything through that mist. Plus, I got struck by lightning. We're just gonna have to set up camp and wait out the storm. Yeah, me, too! [Laughs] Do you remember how to make a fire with sticks? Oh, yeah. I don't think it's workin', man. That's not it. I think you're on to something, though. [Blows on a twig while twisting it] [Knocking two twigs together] Come on, boys, come on! [Rubbing his hands together while holding a stick] You just gotta get some momentum going. [Pokes himself in the face with the stick; muffled] AAAAAAH! Glob-globbing stick! Glob-globbing swamp! [Streches up above trees and gets struck by lightning] AAAAAAAAAAAAH! [Comes down with lit stick, drops stick onto pile of sticks, runs off screen while screaming, comes back] Oh, hey, you got the fire goin'. Right on! I don't know, but let's pound him while he's vulnerable. [Pulls on ear and lifts and drops his jowls] Whoaa! [Heads toward frog] Ow, my head hurts. Oh, what?! [Birds land on the wooden structure] Yeah, [laughs]. Hey, whoa! That gives me a great idea. We can make a Finn and [Looking at Mega Frog] Fuh-fuh-fuh... fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh... [continues] FUH-FUH-FUH-FROOOOOOG!! Finn, that is gross, man! Don't use language like that. [As blow lands] Chomp that! Aaaah! He's eating me! Aah! Gently eating me! No teeth! Mostly tongue! [Pushes frog away from him] Oof! Sick, dude! [Sees Finn] Huh? Great. We’re gonna look so great for this funeral. You look great! We gotta chop this thing into smashaghetti. Got it! Great work distracting ‘em, Finn. You okay, dude? Yeah, my hands are a little sore from smashing, but I’m fine too. BMO! Me and Finn took this whole bad block down ourselves! Took a bit of fananglin’, but I never hunt what I can’t catch. I’ll come too! We don’t need a boat! Have you forgotten? With a little imagination… ...I can be anything that you could ever... ...Oh, I lost focus. Hey, yeah, can we borrow your boat? Charlie, hi. It’s me! It’s dad. I have to go on a sea voyage, honey. I wanted to say bye. I can’t hear anything. Bye, love you! Mwah! And, I’m telling the other pups! Aw, I’m gonna miss you so much, lady. Finn, did you bring your nail clippers? Cool, I forgot too. Bye, kids! Don’t be naughty. Ooo! What's that? Woo! Yeah? Oh, yeah? What's that? Hey, how can you sing like that, dude? Oh, yeah. Seriously, Stanley. For a watermelon you get into trouble way more often than you should. W-whoa! That... is the most adorable thing I have ever seen. And he loves your baby song. Sing some more of it, dude. Keep it going, man! [Laughs] [Laughs] Yeah! I've got that on my back. I call it my butt. Whoa! Little baby feet! What are you doing? Enough hygiene. [Putting a record into a phonograph] Let's get to it! [Yawns] Mornin'. [Laughs] Yeah, ok. [Pointing with his cup] Over there. Slam-a-cow! That fool looks rumped. Well, look at him. He's all limp... and weird. He doesn't want to drink that goop, man. You mean the grapes? That doesn't sound good. [Looking at one of the Jiggler's holes as it leaks a pink juice] Uh, you think we... think we fed the wrong hole? No way! Holy fig, that's awesome! What food are you drawing now? [Distressed] Well, don't feed it me! No! [Running away with the Jiggler] Ahhh! Keep it away! Shoo! Shoo! [Screaming] [Snatches the drawing away from Finn] Dude! You eating me is just as bad as the Jiggler eating me. Yes. If that is what must be done. I taste awesome. I'll get the tunes! Yeah, Jiggler. Go nuts! Go nuts like there's bugs on your butts! Whoa! What the heck? What's wrong with him? Oh, man... All I could find was your glass eye collection! Aw, man. They're in mint condition. [Running over with glass eyes and eyepatches] Alright! Coming! One... more... patch! [Sigh] Finished. Ugh. He looks terrible. Finn, I know you don't want to hear this, but I think we should cut our losses and bring this fella back to where we found him. Oh... Finn. Ok... Our pet exploded. Maybe we can... scrape him up! And... eyuhh... And the cupboards! I wonder... Where's his heinie? Found it! Come here, you! Hey! Ok. Got him! Well, at least he's all in one piece. Sheesh. You think he's dead? Finn. Stop it, man. What are you doing? Just put him down. I think he's trying to tell us something. Finn, this looks like it could be his Mama Jiggler Look... Chill out, ok? We can fix this. Check it out. [Pointing to a house in the background of the image] His mom looks like she's out by Stanley's house... where we found the Jiggler. If we get him back to her, she'll be able to fix him up! Did you hear that? Whistling! Look! The little guy wants to go home! [Waving] Be well. He feels cold. Finn, wait! Huh? [Sniffs the air and then himself] Oh, man! [Stretches his arms, grabbing Finn and pulling him back] Finn! I figured it out, dude. It's the juice. The Jiggler needs to smell like its mama's juice. That's how wild animals know what’s going on... and this guy right here is all drained out. We gotta toss it in the soup, brother. You said it! That was a nightmare. You alright, buddy? Another nightmare? Whoa, the Cosmic Owl? What if that was a premonition dream, Finn? Could be... We better go tell Billy about it just in case. He'll know what to do. I dreamed I was in kindergarten again, but I had really big feet and was also the teacher. Come on! We better hurry! BILLY!!! WAKE UP!!!! We came to see if you were dead! [Squinty-eyed] Cool! You sure that's a gem? Gross.... Man, we got so many gems, it's crazy! Hey Billy, how many gems we still need to get? Two? One? Wait... Two? Or One? Hmm... [The gems shake inside his bag] Ooooooohhhhhhh! Cool! Enhance! Whoa... Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm...MAKE IT STOP! Let's go get that gem! [pointing] Dude! Shooting star! Make a wish! Oh, you know. That something special only two bros can share. You mean the... Oh, man I wanna ride it so bad! You can't control it dude. You have to let it give you control. Start wishin'! [chuckles] Yoga balls aren't that really huge, dude. [whispering] Should we like, try to cheat and stretch over the walls? Okay, well... then... I'll just hook my legs around this stump and stretch us through so we don't get lost. Like this, see? [ Thank you. Nah, we're here to save you, guy! This is our chance! [slides under the Hot Dog Knights and picks them up.] Hold on boys, we're gonna get us some wishes! Choo-choo. [ Yeah, I got a nice bod! Okay, well you can take your weird body issues and tuck them somewhere private. Where I can take my healthy body issues... and [ I'm on it! [ [straining] Stop flexing. I can't... stretch.... any more. Come on baby. [exhausted] Golem... taken care of... dudes. [still exhausted] Hehe. [sighs] Alright. Come on, Finn. The stretching train is leaving the station. Choo-choo. Just gotta keep stretchin'. No. Whoa! Check that out! Hmm. Hey, man. Watch it. I think that's my nerp, but like super stretched out. [laughing] Stop man! [shocked] NERP! I got it! [ Owowowowowowowowow. [coughing] I'm good, man. It's the small scorpions you gotta worry about. Or is that just with snakes? [rumbling] Oop, nope, wait, poison's kickin' in. [groans in pain] [groaning] Alright, you guys, hop on! [ [reassuring] I'm fine, brother. We'll have that war elephant in no time! [raspy whisper] Yes. Huh, yeah, I just... can't close my eyes... lids... too tight. Yeah... I'm feeling a little thin. Ah, alright. [stretching towards the puzzle] I'm goin' for it! [grunts] Done! [while getting thinner] Gotta move carefully. My internal organs are super stretched, I'm paper thin! Ow! Ooh! My insides are all mashes up! You were right. I pushed myself too far. I'll never fall victim to peer pressure again! Actually, I'll do anything you guys want if you say my name three times. [ Here we go! [coughs] Ooh. But I'm too weak! Yeaargh! That's it, I'm dead. [He drops Finn and collapses, he is now thinner than Finn's arm.] Nah. Huh? Right. So hard to think on an empty stomach. I wish I wasn't so hungry. [ I know. You should wish for the Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant. It's what we wanted. Do it... for... me! Yes! It has to give you control! Remember! Yeah, boyyy! Mmhmm! This is gonna be easy as... uh... mm... Yeah, okay. Where's your village? Sammiches! Be alert. Anything could pop out of there and rip our faces off. [makes arm muscular] Be careful, Finn. It's you! LSP, what the heck are you doin' here? Whaaaaat? Oh, and then you found this windmill. Yeah, that'll work. Yeah, you could just let her go. Yeah, we didn't really do that much. Man, birthday-holiday overlap. That's some tough luck. Everyone's all jollied-out when it's your turn for jollies. Well, I suppose. But you don't got to be so technical about it. Hey, thanks. Hey, Moe! New haircut? Well, we made a cake. Yeah, BMO's like a baby almost. [hiding in a cup] Oh, hey, I'm on my way. One sec. Finn, all this is heck of awkward without BMO -- way more awkward than I thought it'd be. I think maybe I don't like old people. They make me feel like I'm gonna get old one day, too. I'm just gonna stay in this cup for a bit. I'll be out later. [He turns around.] Yeah, but she listens to music. Moe probably only, like, listens to the sound of the earth decaying. [whispering, to Finn] I think I'm feeling better now. [growing huge] Yeah! Did you see what we did, Moe? Moe? It's exactly what it says it is. So, hey, uh, Gwampa, feels too quiet in here. Maybe we can hang out with Neptr. He can rap or something. Oh, you have games like BMO? Let's do that, Gwampa! [gasps] Yeah, let's play hang-a-man! Show us what you did, hangman! What haven't we guessed yet? "B." "Burgess Meredithe"?! ["Moe"'s screen changes to a guy swinging a wrecking ball, with "win" on the bottom of the screen.] I don't even know what that is! Uh, I don't know, "E.' [Three "E's" pop up on the blank spaces.] Is this "Burgess Meredithe" again?! [A "B" pops up on the first blank letter space.] Not cool! Come on, Finn, let's find a real hangman. I don't even know what I'd do with a hangman if I got one. If you tell us where the bandits went, we'll avenge your legs! [feeling Neptr's head] Neptr's out cold. He's got a heck of a dent on his head. Yeah, man, be cool. BMO's like our best friend. Ow! Well, I don't like that. Sorry your birthday was weird. Coming! Just gotta get this cocoa pipin'. Okay. Let's watch some stars. Oh. Okay. Hey, man, I think I hear something weird over there with my little doggy ears. Naw, man. What I heard didn't sound like her. Give me a peek on there. This is pretty much just a tube. [ Uh... it looks like he's headed for the Mountain of Matthew. I hear beaucoup spookoo legends about that place. Huh? How come you care where Lemongrab goes? Okay, okay. I feel you. Let's do some things. [ Whoa! Dang it! [ [ Okay. [Finn and [ Oh, yeah! It's time, BMO! Finn Cakes, boy! Up-up, BMO. Finn always gets the first Finn Cake. Why are you being so opaque about not letting me in there? Gol' ding! Yo, class, hold on. Uh... Okay. Here we are. I don't know what to do. Yeah, but he just keeps dropping them on the ground, and we're all like, "It's still good. Look." [gasps] Plan C? Are you sure? You're right. Plan C, activate. Plan C, plan C,... Aha. Bingo. Hmm. What's plan C, again? Something about music? You got it, Sooz. Oh, hey buddy. Even better. It's a "Battle of the Bands"! No! You are! [Breathes hard and climbs down the ladder] Finn, oh my grosh, Finn! It was amazing! I had a croak dream, Finn! My croak dream! [Laughs] Mhmm! Yeah man! [Does a summersault] There was a rocket ship [rolling over], you weren't there [looking back at Finn], and there was a Banana Man [Does another summersault landing on his head] and I ran out of air and in outer space [breathing hard] and isn't that great Finn! Aww, come on Finn [Going between Finn's legs and wrapping around them a little] There's nothing to worry about! Think about it, I don't know any Banana Man Finn and rocket ships haven't been reinvented yet! I'll probably live another hundred years, easy. Someones downstairs. Who is it? [Blows a raspberry.] [quietly] What do we do? [looking over and quiet] Is he still out there? Phew, see I told you today wasn't the day! Hey, you wanna make an ice cream pizza? Finn, [sets the ice cream pizza on BMO] when I die my individual earth conscious is gonna go all everywhere while glob tallies my deeds! I'm gonna be all around you! [Stretches out branches.] In your nose, in your dreams and socks, I'll be a part of you in your earth mind! [Stretches back to normal form] It's gonna be great! No one can change your croak dream, Finn, not even you. Why? No man, he's walking into his house! [Banana Man walks towards his house]. Finn, did you eat your breakfast? Because you forgot how the sun works. The sun is actually far away, it's not just sitting on the horizon. [Puts his arm around Finn.] You gotta eat your breakfast man, eat the protein. Helps your brain. Whoa, just like in my dream! [Finn pulls Dude, just except it! What are you doing man? [Finn takes out an arrow] Ahh!! Ahh! Wait, you're not gonna kill him, are you?! Careful man, I want to be alive for my croak! Dude, man. I appreciate why you're doing this, but you're not gonna stop me from transcend in to Glob world! Huh? [They see a big rocket ship with supplies on the ground and dynamite to trigger the rocket.] The rocket from my croak dream! Oh, man. I guess... I guess this is it. I've gotta embrace this today! You can't stop destiny, Finn! [He wipes his head.] Huh? No, man! [He jumps out and tackles Finn. Banana Man comes out and sees the confusion.] Yeyuh! Banana Man! Get your butt on board, we've got a date with destiny! Get off! You cant mess with fate! Finn! Finn. Finn, let me go. You have to let me go. DESTINY! [Shakes Finn off his leg when the rocket is about to shoot off] Take care, brother. You weren't by my side in the croak dream but I'm glad you're here to see me off See you on the other side! [The dynamite ignites and the rocket starts fly.] Huh? Whaaa? Am I in glob world? Fiiiiiiinnn, don't try to stop me, Finn! Thanks man, I knew you'd come around. Take it easy there, buddy. Poor Banana Man. So I guess that wasn't a real croak dream after all! It didn't really come together quite right. Hey no wait, in the croak dream it was me and Banana Man, [Stretches himself and Banana Man on his belly] but this time you were here too. [Stretches Finn on his belly] So... [Stretches stomach back to normal] it must be destined to happen again when your not around! Hmm? [Finn puts his face against [Slight pause] Get off of me! No! No, c'mon! I know you're not a ghost, Finn! Stop chasing me! He's magnificent! Yep. All right, let's hit it. [starts to move towards the tunnel] Bye! Goodbye! Heh, that was fun, but why'd you do it? I guess this is it. Yeah, man, mostly just looks empty. I mean, what thief would ever hang out here? There's nothing to steal! True, true. This place is perfect for toting tarts. Heheheh, yeah. Ohh, wait! Hold up! Shh. [sniffs] It's a campfire—close by. Maybe. What? Whatcha sayin'? I think they're just dirty hobos. Why? Oh, yeah. Rawr! [hits Taddle] Uh-oh, man, he got, like, five or six! They're radical! No tart problems here! I think the plan went awry. Oh, yeah, and who knows what kind of freaky things would have happened if we took the Royal Tart Path? [Finn puts on the tart pack] Heheh, old Cinnamon Bun's probably got his hands full. Huh? How? So no thieves! You are on a roll today, buddy! Yeah, P.U.! Yeah? Uh, just now? No. Hmm. Hey, Finn? Did you just, uh, lick me—all the way up my arm? Hmm. Strange. Uh-oh! Man, we got got! There's only two left! Whoa, whoa, take it easy, buddy. We've still got two whole tarts left. PB is gonna be fine. Yeah, why not? Finn, he's got a laser gun! Mmm, yeah—or... we could smash in there and stop Congress from chopping her head off. And there's Cinnamon Bun over there! Psht! Whatever, man. Heh heh. Yo, guys! You gotta do something! That's my best friend in there! [texts on his phone] "You okay in there?" I know! It's called... [farts into pillow] And it is deadly. Ha-a. [eats chips] [laughs] Of course I am! See these tears of worry? [produces fake tears] Hey, why don't you guys team up and fight each other to see who gets to wear the crown. [points to painting of Princess Bubblegum] [laughs] Man, this is intense. I better do something! [takes a bunch of selfies] They devolved into beasts. It has hilarious. What? My butt? Weird. Where are we? Ouch! Hmm. Hmm. Not that great. I feel weird in my skin. Yeah... but I could get used to this. Okay. Okay. Okay. [hums, begins singing] Broke-up dimension, you're breakin' my heart. I'm lookin' for broke-up girl to break me apart. [stops singing] Just kiddin'. I got a girl! [snaps fingers and produces image of Lady in hand] Lady Rainicorn, yeah! Hmm, that don't look right. [adds mane to image] That's better. [kisses image] Hmm? [looks down at his seat] Oh my fun. I thought you was a rock. Whoops! [gets up] Sorry. Cool. You wanna be friends? Whoa. Seriously? [looks into empty shell] Hello? [sadly realizes it's empty] I'm just gonna pretend you're sleeping. [turns over shell and sits on it, frowning] [on screen] Hey, Lady. You asked me to make you a video. [on screen] ...saying JTD won't change his doggy ways. [on screen] Okay, I love you girl. I hope you liked it. Bye! [kisses camera] [On screen] Okay, this is scene one and take one of Heat Signature 2. Ready? Action! No! Hmm, guess what, Lady? This dirty dog needs a bath! Wawoo! What'a mean? Uh, what? That's my dad, Joshua, back in the old days. I'm his son, dude. He's dead, dude. Don't make me get emotional about it. Okay, that's weird. You want to get beat up? That's weird. I'm not doin' your weird biz. Nope. What the—! I'm Jay T.—the Dog. I'm Whoa, lady, no way. This boy's got. I like the way you talk, but you are crazy. [whispering] No, girl, we can bounce outta here. My friend Finn will save us any second now. Well, I guess we're gonna have to fight then. Finn, yes! Help me! This isn't hugging—it's fighting! Fighting! No, that is not correct! My blood! Woo! Woop! Hey, hey! Lady! [He walks over to Lady and gives her a hug.] Samantha, you can come too, I guess. You made an oath. Okay. Nah, I'll just stretch into a tree. Pshh, please! Not even. Uh, because... Kee-Oth was right there! An-and there were traps! I didn't have no blood this whole time, so I'm totally out of it. [He falls to the ground.] Woo...Sorry, I got a little light-headed. I love you too, Lady. Okay, big hug! [With mouth full] I know what the Ice Cream Marathon is. [Swallows ice cream] I've been training for weeks. And I am determined to eat more ice cream at the Ice Cream Marathon than anyone else! Ice cream is good! What the croak was that? What? That's a frog dressed up like a Gnome Knight. And now you're, like, attracting a mate? Oh. Well, you should just let go, man. Uh-oh. [Sing-song] Somebody's gonna do a quest for a frog. Huh? Beans?! Ah ha ha! Magic beans... hee! We'll be right back. Come on, Finn. I think I dropped my spoon in the bush. [Walks off] Dude, what's goin' on? What?! The beans? [Brandishes spoon at Gnome Knight] Now wait a second! Well, we should get a move on if we wanna make the Ice Cream Marathon. [Walks off] [Reentering] Really? We have to do the bean quest? Yeah, I wasn't here for that, so... can't we guard the beans and eat ice cream? "...unless you're a clown." I do say that a lot. Gee, sittin' in this hot sun, guarding beans. It sure beats 26 miles of vanilla ice cream. Or caramel ice cream. Or peach ice cream. Hey, what if we plant the beans ourselves? No, wait, hear me out. See, [opens chest] if one of these beans is evil, then it's our duty to crush it, once and for all! Plus, two of the beans are good. If we plant them, we'll be bringin' twice as much good into the world! I hadn't even thought about that! [Yawns, grabs a pillow from off screen] I'm gonna take a cat nap. [Yawning] If we take shifts, there's less chance of us falling asleep at the same time. [Starts snoring] [Rubbing eyes] Huh? [Yawns, opens eyes] Oh! Aw, look how cute they look all sleepy and snore-y. Aw, they're so cute they can hardly hold their pencils. Nothing evil could be this adorable. YES! [Runs over to pigs] You hear that, guys? You passed! A-plus! A-plus-plus! [Shielding pigs] Stay back, babies! What? COOL! [Runs over to the wands and picks one up] [Waves wand around, sprinkling glitter] WOW! It's a wand that poops glitter! What's good-er than that?! [Runs over to pigs] Whee-hee-hee-hee-hee! [Sprinkles glitter on pigs] Hey, let's have some fun with these pigs before the evil pod shows up! I'm exhausted! And then go to the Ice Cream Marathon, right? [Yawns] Okay. I'll take the first shift. It's bigger than the other two, dude! Huh? [Pod starts leaking brown substance] It's squirting! See? Squirting. Right here. [Touches substance and licks his finger] Tastes good. [Starts licking the opening] [Pulls back pod skin] No, it's not. It's... ice cream! [Starts eating] [Sighs] That was awesome. No, man! It was awesome! Aw, yeah! [Eats some ice cream. It replenishes.] This pod makes ice cream out of nothing! It's the "goodest" thing that's ever happened to me! And so are the fairy wands. Well, I found my weakness [starts eating ice cream from pod]. [Stops eating] What about ice cream? Just the thought of that scares me, man. Ah, gross! That's--EW! [Starts dancing] Ahh, I can't stop dancing! It must be the glitter! Oh, I really can't stop groovin'! It feels weird! Go on without me! [Still dancing] Whoo! Yeah, man! Kill it! [Still dancing] He's tryin' to trick you! Kill it! Not so fast! I'll take it from here, folks. [Starts eating] [Angrily] I've always got room for ice cream, Finn. You know that, man! Ugh, I'm going to the Ice Cream Marathon. Whoops. Hey, what's it supposed to be, anyway? ...Sooo this means you wanna give 'er your spit, huh? It's okay, dude. I totally get it. Haw haw haw. You mean her... Super Science Barbecue?! Relax. She'll love it! [To himself] And then she'll love you. Heh heh heh... Hey, there's Bubblegum! [Princess Bubblegum dumps charcoal on a grill.] Hide it behind your back, man! [Princess Bubblegum feeds Flambo a piece of charcoal.] Princess! [Now a paper bag] Buddy, just breathe into me. [Turns back to normal] You're just gonna give a speech to a buncha' brainiacs. Then we'll just borrow some brains by goin' to the place where knowledge liiives! Uh, no, the library. No... Just the regular library. Hey, Finn, let's split. This turned out to be boring. Okay, okay... I'll just keep readin' this book about figs. Haha! Whatcha doin'?! Yeah, then you can at least sound smart... but where're you gonna find someone like that? Heh heh heh heh heh. Oh, yeah. OH! Let's just solve this thing with magic! [Not seeing anything wrong] Yeah. It's the easy way out! Whoa, bud, are you okay? More spit bubbles? And how will you do that? Finn!! Don't do anything stupid!! You got problems, man. Yeah, be their king. Finn's gonna need a queen... I'll do it. Show me what we got, Gummy. Show it to me! [stretches head across body] Dude! I'm psyched! Can you make that a bunk bed? I call top. [jumps on top] [Immediately falls asleep. A lion and a goose sleep with him.] No way, dude. [rolls over and farts, waking the lion] Maybe, but rules are rules. [a goblin spits stuff out on I'm in here. pbbbbbbbbbbbbb. All right, man, how do we do this? What if they figure it out? Jump in my mouth. [Finn does so and [sighs] Alright. [they walk home] Yep. Mmhmm. Wha? Ohh, uh, a wizard put a curse on me. Finn? [reaches downstairs] What's going on? [turns his head] Is the spaghetti all—whoa! [stretches towards Finn] Finn, what happened? [scoffs] Man, I knew that arm was bogus. Man, don't worry about that. [walks Finn to the couch] You just went through some outrageous beeswax from losing your favorite arm and et cetera. You can't just expect to bounce right back to normal. Nah, man. Listen. [grabs two fake arms] All these princesses donating all these gross fake arms—they mean well, [throws both fake arms in the air] but they're throwing you off your game! You got to go at your own pace. If you listen [opens fold of skin around forehead] deep in your melon heart... [melon heart starts beating] that's where the real instructions are. [chuckles] Well, those things are bad, [grabs bag from table] so they can't be the real instructions, but you keep listening. Me—I'm going to go to the spaghetti store and buy a new mop head. I'll be back soon. Just remember—listen to your melon heart. [walks down ladder] Afternoon Princess. What's that you're building? I might. [ Word. Word. Pfft. TMLO Princess. That means lay off. Finn's feeling this one out solo style. Give the kid a chance. [Shakes from cold and yells up to Finn] Goodnight buddy, I'm proud of you. Feelings hurt! Eeeeeeeeeah. Oh, hey buddy you're back. How are you feeling? Ha, Ha! That's great! [Points at Finn's head.] You can always trust the old melon heart to get you through. [Looks at tower.] So I guess we won't be needing this thing anymore. You wanna do the honors? What? Finn?! I'm coming! [ [sighs] Yo, bro, you're sleepwalking again! Wake up! [He slaps Finn.] Yes, Finn. Again. Every time youse is screaming about "She's got me!" and all that. Wait, you don't remember? You just woke up, man! Recall it, baby! Come on. That's too much; don't punch yourself. [sighs] [He grabs Finn.] You're repressin' the memory, dude! You're hiding whatever she is in a mental vault. Okay, so you even know you're doing it? [He lets go of Finn.] Listen, we gotta find out who this lady is. We gotta open the vault a little. This is just gonna keep happening, man. Finn, for reals. Alright. Chill, chill. Don't sweat it, man. It's not even a thing. Why don't you clean up the kitchen now? It's alright. It's only, like, the fifth room you've train-wrecked this month. Wow, that was fast. While you were doing that, I downloaded a new game on BMO. [ I don't know. Lady said it's good. Naw, this is different. [ Go in there, man! Don't be scurred. What do you see? Do you remember anything about the scary lady? How you doin', buddy? That's cool. Whachu' gonna do about it? What was th—aww, no. [covers himself with his blanket] Dog-drangit, Finn... [Shrinks to normal size] Yeah, man. Makes me wish I didn't have to poop ever again and could just la... ah...ow! Hey, what the heck am I laying on? Hmm! [Looks at Finn] Let's get outta here and wreck some stuff with this thing! Oh, snap, look! Sorry, this thing's kinda got a mind of— [panicking] Ah-haha! What are we gonna do? Wow, Ice King! Heh heh! That was amazing! You got it. [laughs] Surprise! [He bites the monster's hand and latches on.] Finn, get in here! [He and the monster continue fighting.] Feeling good, buddy? [Struggling to keep the monster's arms restrained.] Slay him quick. He's got crazy devil strength! Finn, are you doing the thing? Aw, dude, you are doing the thing again! Slay him! Finn! Finn, stop showing mercy! [Pained] Love you forever, man, but your guilt's hurting the team dynamics. Cool. I'm gonna make peace with my aging body. Dude... how long are we gonna follow this frog? It looks cool in there! What're you talkin' about? [Indicating his legs] I got two keys right here! Wow! Look at this place! They look like donuts. Wait a second... I don't know what poison smells like. Hey! No, I didn't. I just sniffed it. Listen, Mrs. Witch. Well, I never ate your donuts. [Mouth full] No, I'm not! [Noticing he is holding a donut] Whoa-hoa! Hm... That's weird... I don't even remember grabbing this. My subconscious must be hungry, huh? Huh... whatever. [Finishes donut] Uh-oh. [Gets blasted] Yeah... I think so. Just a little chilly. [Noticing he is in his underwear] WHOA! Yeah, it's not like I killed your husband or somethin'. And what gives? [Pointing to his nipple] I used to have like eight more of these things. Well, you can forget it because you're the one who's wrong! [To Finn] ...Right? Ha. That takes me back. Let me just... [deep voice] remember. [A memory bubble appears above his head.] I see a memory. When I was just a pupster... I'm rollin' around in a mud puddle, and I'm just... lovin's it. Oh, no! [The bubble explodes. Oh. Um... I went into the mud, and... I guess I became a magic dog? [Lying down] That's nuts, man. You got any idea of how many mud puddles are in the land of Ooo? Four? Maybe even five? Nonsense... but I like it! Yeah, let's do it! I forgot that I don't have magic powers anymore. How do we search for the mud without my powers? [To himself] This whole time, I thought running was some sort of... leg magic. [ It's too hard! [Straining] I can't reach. [Finn bends backwards; I'll stretch into a boat! [Strains then farts] I'm startin' to really miss that old magic of mine. [To himself] Man, that looks exhausting. [Gasp] What are you?! Okay, what are you doing here? [Donning the hat] Ha ha! Man, I'm glad I met you. Uh, I can't swim that river, dude. My subconscious says it's too hard. Check out this hat, though. Whatcha workin' on, Finn? [Finn continues constructing a catapult from the junk, still mumbling angrily to himself. "... have to do everything!"] Look at you! Doin' stuff! [Finn pulls down the catapult lever.] Oh, is it a chair? [ Oh, yeah! I can feel this workin'! In fact, you should roll in the mud with me, Finn! We can both be magic! This isn't the right mud. I was just really hopin' this was over and done. Actually... I'm feeling kinda chubby-tired. Can't we do this tomorrow? Never! I'd rather be powerless forever then apologize! I'm lazy but prideful. Adventuring is too much hard work for a bro without his powers. Nah, from now on, I'm just your regular old dog. ...Ironic given my current man-baby body. I'll scare her off, Finn! [Barks at her] Finn! I've got an idea! Rub my belly! Yeah, I'm one of those kinda dogs. Finn? [Gary takes him to her nest.] Finn! Come on, Finn! You gotta save yourself! I'm just a dog! Aw, man. Oh, geez... Okay. Then I'm back on the team! [Attempts to climb tree] I'll save you! Don't worry! [He fails to climb the tree.] Hey, Finn... Can you help me to get up there? [Desperate noise] If only I had my powers back! I know, I know! I have to apologize to that Witch. [At gate] Hey! [He's straining to get past the gate, but he's too fat.] Witch! I need my powers back! So I'm sorry! I'm so sorry I ate your donut! [Straining sounds] ...Oh. [Stops straining] So do I get my powers back?! What?! Why?! No way, Jose! He's my subconscious. I, You're recording this?! No way. I have my dignity. [To his subconscious] Oh, no, dude! What do we do now? Wha?! Why are you dying, bro? No! No! [Starts crying] Yeah! [Sobs] If only... I were a humbler guy, my subconscious would be alive, and my best bud wouldn't be trapped in a mermaid's nest! [Magically stretching his arms] My powers! How can I ever thank— [Swipes her magic cane away] Ha! Got your cane! NOPE!!! [He and his subconscious laugh.] Honey, I'm back! How about a big kiss? [ Well, I'm glad you learned your lesson that in a crunch, there's nothin' I wouldn't do for ya. Uh... [Sweats profusely] No way! I must have found the right... mud puddle! Yeah... I don't remember. Heh... eh-heh... [Blabbers lips with relief as the episode ends.] [Shouting] Finn? Oh, hey. Me and BMO are heading over to the vuvuzela store in the Music Kingdom. You want to come with? I got to get a new vuvuzela. Somebody keeps smashing my old one. [He pulls out a snapped vuvuzela and blows into it pathetically. BMO screams in terror at this horrible sound] BMO, how could you? Neptr?! All right, all right. Well, I'm still getting one. You coming? True, true. Okay, well, I'll see you later then. Come on, BMO. [From downstairs] Ah, don't sweat it buddy. Hey, boys! Y'all have fun out there? [He turns around and sees Finn covered in scratches and grass stains, and suddenly shifts to a much more serious tone.] Wait, what happened? You and BMO play Finger Spread quietly. I need to get into the zone. [walks over to the window and looks up] I am ready to receive instruction from the realm of creation above me for the sandwich I am about to conceive. I am open; use me. [sharpening knives] One, two, three, four, five, six. [putting herbs on a steak] Rosemary, thyme. [puts the steak in a bag, seals it, and places it in a pot of hot water] Sous-vide. Keep that at 135 degrees. [cuts a loaf of bread in half and uses a blowtorch to toast the inside] All right, now we're gettin' somewhere. [places each ingredient on the bread as he says their names] Cream cheese! Pickles from my boy Prismo! And some dill! [grabs a bird from the windowsill] Diced boiled eggs! Bird from the window! Yeah, baby, now we're rollin'! Whoo! Common cucumber! Sliced Roma tomato. Sweet yellow onion—organic. [tears up] Oh, almost done. [wipes tears away and puts them in the sandwich] Tears for salt. Meat prepared sous-vide. ♪Bacon.♪ [holds up a lobster] You're the most important part. [He puts the lobster in a pot of boiling water, and its soul escapes. You guys want some? Thank you. [ You stay away from my woman! Eh, my sandwich! Sandwiche! Mijo! Magic Man! My sandwich! What are you gonna do with it? Something gross? NOOOO! [stretches his arms toward Magic Man] [groaning] Give it back, you animal! That's not even a riddle! It's wordplay, at best! Ow! What the? [growls] What's he doin' in there? Why did he freeze himself with my sandwich? Aww, that's gross! Yeah, okay. [slow-mo] Hey, Finn. [slow-mo] How long have we been in here? [slow-mo] Retreat! Five hours?! [stretches around the sphere to see Magic Man] He's halfway to hittin' the ground... which is when he'll bite my sandwich, probably. [groans] Must be his new software. What?! BMO, are you serious? Yes! Yes! Are you sure? Okay, BMO. He lied to me. [sighs] Maybe I should just make another one. [goes inside, turns on the radio again, and dances limply] [sighs deeply] Eh, okay. Let's do this. I can make another awesome sandwich. Creation realm, inspire me once again! [looks out the window at storm clouds, and the wind chimes fall] [uncertainly] Okay. Oh... maybe... maybe it's just as good! [puts the sandwich together and takes a bite] Blech! [spits it out and throws the sandwich on the floor] It's terrible! [starting to cry] Dang you, Magic Man! You took my one and only! [takes a bag and heads outside] Not too well. BMO looks cool, though. [sighs] What's your plan? I'm lighting these candles so I can move on with the grieving process. I made them with the leftover bacon fat from my sand—[sobs] Tree Trunks?! No, man, don't call Tree Trunks! What's she gonna do, bake an apple pie?! Don't you get it?! It's over. It's over, and I've never been so sad. And you know what? I got to deal with it. [walks into sphere but does not slow down] Hmm? What? But how? What?! Nobody [begins to slow down] calls it that. Right. [walks deeper into the sphere] [sobbing] Magic Man, I'm gonna sock you in the head! [punches his palm] [laughs] [starts slowing down again] Uh... okay! Hey, Mr. Cupcake, you stay away [starts slowing down] from Lady! Uh... What? Um, I love you too, Mr. Cupcake. I didn't want to hang because I thought Lady was into your muscles. And I thought if we'd hung out, you'd sweet-talk her and take her from me. Dude, I have so much respect for you! I try to be like you in some aspects of my life! Look, if something were to happen to me, and I wasn't here anymore, I'd want you to take care of Lady and the kids. [tearing up] Me, too! [crying] [now running through the sphere] I'm sorry, Mr. Cupcake! [punches Magic Man and catches his sandwich] [sobbing] Ah-haaaaa! [holds up sandwich] I got you, baby. [takes a bite] [with mouth full] This sandwich is so good! Coming up. [ Kissin' Princess Bubblegum on the mouth! Yeah, you would. You're just bad at talking to ladies. Come on, dude. [Chuckles] Yeah, I heard. [Bored] Bleh. [To the Tree Witch] Uh, can you, um, give us a minute? [Whispering to Finn] Dude, I don't think we should help her. 'Cause she's a witch! Her? Are you kidding? Come on, look at her! [She turns her finger into a Venus fly trap and it swallows a butterfly.] If she was good, she wouldn't be so ugly. No, man! She'll kill us or put a freaky curse on us or something. [Glances at her] Let me get rid of her with some of my world-famous smoove talking. [He walks over to the Tree Witch.] [Smooth talking with romantic music in the background] Hey. Sorry about that, girl. [Lies down] Ahh. You don't mind if I take a load off, do you? How pretty you are. We were just saying someone as pretty as you doesn't even need a full head of hair. [Finn bends down next to him.] Isn't that right, buddy? Girl, if I didn't already have a G.F., I'd be on you like butter on toast! Oh. Umm… Yeah, I think I'm making things worse. Ah-ah-ahhh! What? Um... spaghetti dinner? Hey... uh... what's—?! Yaaah! Hey! I told you she was evil! Nyuh! Get some princess hair!! Noooo! [Whispering] Dude, if they think you like them, then use that. Embrace it! Find the least terrible princess you can, play her some music, cook her a meal, smoove talk her until she likes you. And then get the hair! Marry a princess if you need to! Just get her hair! Aaaah! [Muffled] Go get the hair! [Muffled] Just give it to her, already!! What?! Aaaah! Duuuude! Duuuude! [Crying] Du-hu-huuude... Huh? I don't. [on phone] Finn? Finn? Finn, I'm bored. Are you sure Princess Bubblegum doesn't like me anymore? Sounds weird. Are you lying so you can do this dinner thing alone with Bubblegum? I don't know if this is a good idea after your break-up with Flame Princess. PB is out of your age range, anyway. Yo, man, how's it going? Terrible? Go on. So whatcha saying here? Oh, dang! Didn't you hear? She's got a new boyfriend already! [laughs] Man, I'm just kidding. [laughs with Finn] She might, though. What's the status? Nice! Seal the deal, bro! You can do it, you hear me?! [quickly] I'm playin' BMO—call me later, bye! [hangs up] I think it's goin' good. Where's the key to the tower, BMO?! Tell me! AAAGH! Hey, man! What's the status? Awww. I'm sorry, Finn. But look, man. Lemme share with you a little secret on how to win the heart of a princess. It's not easy, but ya have to be persistent. You might have to defeat a demon lord, and warp through several worlds. But once you do, you walk up the wizard stairs, and produce your magic key you got in a water world and unlock the chamber door. Then, walk right up to the princess, and give her a smooch. Yesss! [triumphantly] Does that make sense? Mmm-hmm. Whooo-hoo-hoo! Noooooo! [blocking Finn] Don't let him eat it all! Yeah! Wowowowowo Best apple pie ever! You ate all the pie... I'd carve my face on the moon so the moon would look like my face! That sounds awesome! YEAH! Or your trunk. And your satisfied face. We love you, Tree Trunks. Psst, I can take you even higher on my shoulders. Oh, yeah. Whatever it is, I'm liking it. Oh, yeah! Whoo! Nah, she'll be fine. It's fine. It's fine! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's fine, she'll be fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine. Where'd she go? Where are you, Tree Trunks? Hiya! Finn?! You go fight—I'll keep Tree Trunks out of trouble. Yeah, Finn can handle it. He's 12. Uhh, you should stay here, Tree Trunks. Uhh, no way. She got passed me, man. I tried to stop her, but she overpowered me. Huh? Finn, kill it! Whoa, man. That's what happens when you care too much, dude. You're the man, Tree Trunks! Whoa! Let her kiss your cheek, man. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Finn! Graw! Ow! Ow. Whoo! Shake it, Tree Trunks! Crud, this is barf dude. I'll get the make up. I'm okay with it. And I'm stupid. Heh-heh, you heard the guardian, TT. Bite that thing. Yeah! How is it? [bouncing] Whoop! Bouncing! [Hits the ground] Oof! Yes! AAAAAGH! You're still biting me!! This is... new. It's nothin' ominous, though. Just a bump. What? You think I'm gonna turn all lumpy like her? Get outta here. [Arm suddenly lumps up] Wha? Finn, I think I'm freakin' out! Uh, could you skip to the part where you tell us where the antidote is? Actually, I think I'm beating it back with sheer willpower! [Part of his head bulges up.] [flatly] Oh, my. [Forces lump back into body] Aw, Finn, this music ducks, right? [suddenly in a lumpy accent] Ah. I love this song. We should totally TP Shandala's house! [in normal voice] Gracious! That was terrible! Finn, if you can't save me from the lumps... if I do turn... if I become lumpy like them, I want you to— Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm saying that if I go totally lumpy, then I want you to get used to lumpy Um... bumps. Aw, man! No. Because no matter how messed up and lumpy I get, this guy never turns his back on me! [Completely transforms into a Lumpy Space person.] Oh, yah. Right behind ya. Just gotta turn my back on this guy. [Literally does so then exits] Yeah! Promcoming! Yeah! Cool! No! [Slaps sphere down] No!! Chyah! I remember you! You're just a smoothie wannabe lumpy poser! NO!! Hey. Stop talkin' to yourself, dumb guy. Take your ball and get outta here. So I can't have it now, eh? GIMME THAT BALL!! I want it! Give it to me! Bumps, bi— [Sits on the sphere and turns back to normal.] [gasps] Oh, I'm not lumpy anymore! Oh, no. Finn buddy! You gotta sit on this! Finn! Hey, Finn! Hey, buddy! Finn Hey, dude. We made it. [Lumpy voice] That sounds totally lame. [Normal voice, laughs] I'm just kidding. Let's dance! Ha ha! Yeah man! [Running away] I call being dog and you be human! Dog! Dog Dog Dog Dog! What? Oh yeah. [chuckles] Bark! Bark Bark Bark Bark! [Chuckles] Ready! Bark! [The disk flies up to the top of an extremely tall tree] [chuckles] More like the perfect blow! That blew. [ Okay, but it's right here [ [ Uhh! No wonder it's been takin' so long! Need any help? Okay, well, I'm gonna walk Lady home. I'll be back later. Don't eat any more magic apples. Silly. [ You should take it easy. No, no, let's get you back. [Finn muffles " Huff! Cow Teeth and Shirley temple Aaaaaaah! I ran into some vampires! They were being weird as crabs! Do you know these oily doilies, Marceline? Aah! My soul! [Marceline chuckles] Ugh, even though I got my soul sucked, I'll still give you a ride to Bonnie's because I'm good. Okay. There was one that looked like if a baby-snake was a baby-baby. Nah, that's not right. There was another one that looked like if an ant hill were a girl. Nah, that's not right. There's one of them that looked like a wet uncle. Nah, that's not right. There was a lady who looked like black drapes on a cake pop. Nah, that's not right. There was also one that looked like an angry stop sign coming out of a loaf of bread. Nah, that's not oh, actually that one's pretty close. Ugh! Gross. If anybody wants tea, it will be ready in a few minutes. Whoa, Flame King! Ooh! He was saying "evil, evil, evil" over and over again. Well, I wasn't sure if you heard him 'cause he was whispering. Well, I was just trying to help. Chamomile tea! Don't forget LSP's diet cola. Ice latte for my lady. [Gives Lady her drink] We're so excited that you could be here tonight for Finn and Yeah, that's on all the movies we dig up. Pause, BMO. Sorry we had to cancel. [They close the door] But these movies are before the Great Mushroom War. Dude, we've never found a movie without that warning. Well, what are we gonna do? Wowp! Start to truck in. Keep going. Keep truckin' in, BMO. Yeah. Fantastic, super. Don't lose her, BMO! BMO! BMO, you're gonna miss it! Over there to your right. Look over there. Across the river. I don't get it. It's just a bunch of random junk. Yeah, like a romantic comedy. Wait, that's not what I said. I thought it was great. I think we should use all of it. What? Okay, you're having a picnic, you're in love but you can't admit it. So you're having a playful food fight. And action. Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut, that was not what I wanted! [Sigh] What's next? Hey, Finn. How 'bout when the chariot takes off, she says something like, "Mmm, check, please." I'm sorry. Well, I thought it was funny. Not the way you're shootin' it. All right, but after this we do my part. [Through a megaphone] Okay, everyone. It's been a long day. A lot of... [Chuckles] A lot of running around, chasing frogs [chuckles again]. But we are makin' a movie, and this is the big wedding scene. Mr. Cupcake, you're playing Todd Johnson. And Lady, you confess that you never loved Todd Johnson and that you were just trying to win a bet with your snooty socialite friends. And then, you both realize you do love each other and you both say "I do." And then Shelby, you say... Heh, heh, heh. Yeah. Don't forget to look right at the camera and slap your cheeks like this. [Slaps his cheeks] And 1, 2, 3 action! Lady! Cut! Cut, cut, cut! [To Mr. Cupcake] I didn't tell you to flex out! No, I don't like the way he's flexing at you. Why you... GAAH! Okay. Uh-huh. Me, too. Yeah, I was just thinking that. I know. Yep, it—wait! No! Romantic comedy! What do you mean "what"?! Yeah, me or Finn? Why wait? [Pulls out a pen and paper and begins writing] "Dear BMO, Please use only the best footage when cutting the movie. Love, See you at the movie club, then. As will I. Heh heh. Alright, thanks again everyone for coming to... [Singing] movie night! I hope y'all are in the mood to laugh. It's, ahh, it's more of a romantic comedy. Right, BMO? Yeah, I guess we will. Start the movie, BMO. Me too, dude. That's a good one, BMO! What?! No more crackers? Eeeee. [He runs over to Prismo] Prismo! Prismo! Hey man, Hey! Bad news, you ran out of cheese crackers. Yeah, man, what are you going to do about it? [ Prismo, you make me happy, Prismo. I'm always smiling when I'm around you. I just noticed that. I always am. [giggles] This feels so good. What's up. Aw, don't worry, he ain't gonna hurt nobody. Ha! You got a cup on your head. Ha-ha, you dingus! [laughs] See, he's docile as a lamb. Yeah, man, make your dreams come true. Oh, what time is it? [looks around] Hey, yo, Clock Face, what time is it?! Aw, boo to that! Yo, Prismo I gotta get back before Finn realizes I'm not home. He gets worried if I stay out too long. Laters. [nervously] I was, umm, in the, uh... All right, man, I'm gonna come clean. I've been doing a lot of partying at Prismo's lately. Come on, man! I don't even take Lady up there. Whoa, what? Whoa. [ Yeah, or maybe he was ambushed in the wild and hid you so you wouldn't be captured, too. But... it might also be good to find out if you have any genetic risk factors or allergies or whatever. Plus, you get to see what you'll look as an old guy. Could be cool. Cool. Oh! If we hurry, Prismo might be still partying. [waits] No. Prismo, we need to get to the Citadel. I know you can't grant Finn and me any more wishes. So, we brought Shelby along to wish on our behalf. [upset] Shelby! [sadly] Dang, Shelby. So, what do we gotta do? Rob a cosmic bank? Steal a space baby? That's it? That doesn't seem much of a crime. What? Come on, Finn let's go find this old guy. Nope. Hey, upside-down duck! No, wait, it's right side up. Aha! [He makes his hand large and knocks loudly as he talks loudly] Hey! Get out here, old man! [shrinks head only speaking softly still knocking relatively loud] Hey, get out here, old man. [whispering] Uh oh! [The nightmare version of Prismo comes out of his mouth and scratches the wall] Finn, a little help? Gizzow Let's see here. [normally] Dude's got serious night terrors. So, wait, what happens to him when we wake him up? [sadly] Prismo. You sure about this? Still feels like a bad idea, man. Prismo, don't worry! I'll put the old man to sleep and get you back! Aw, no man, how are you gonna see your dad?! Old man Prismo. No, old man Prismo, don't talk to him. Ha ha, yeah. And I swung him around into that golden cactus? Yeah, man, that adventure was tight. I can't wait to get back home, though. I need some sleep— [Nods] Great minds. [Points to head] Finn? [Runs towards the hole] Finn! [Hits head on branch] Ohh! [Groans, stumbles backwards, and falls into another hole] Oh... Ohh... [Rubs head] My--my cabbage aches a little... What happened? Parachute? Hole? Walnuts? Fell down, wait! [Gets up] You mean we're falling right now? [Stretches up and to the left] Thanks for your help, buddy, but I gotta go. My friend's still up top. He could be looking for me. Or, he could be in trouble and every second I'm down here I'm falling further away. I gotta get back. But, I've got to do something. Mmm. You know I think you're right! [Stretches down to the platform] Finn is a pretty heroic kid, I gotta admit. He'll probably be here in half a gif. [Takes the walnut] Thanks, man. I'm [Eating walnuts on his stomach] Mm. So how did you pass the time? Freecell? Mm. Yeah, man. You know, also, I know some other card games we could play. You know, together. [Looks up] Oh! Hey, Finn! Who's your new friend? [Gasps] Why you... [opens an upstairs window] What? Whoa! [picks up BMO and stretches them down to Finn] Where did ya get this baby? [rubs truck] Oh, yeah? Like what? Yeah, buddy! [gives thumbs up] Nice! Let's crank this beast up. Nuts. BMO, you know anything about cars? Wait... I know someone who's good with mechanics. Hey, Banana Man. Yeah, alright. Whoo. I'm bushed. You guys wanna pick this up again in the mornin'? Yeah. Biodiesel. Well, then go over and talk to her. That's the craziest thing I ever heard. [stretches his arm to the wheel and his foot to the gas pedal and drives the truck over to the guard] Pardon me, miss. My friend here is super smart, and he rebuilt this truck. Anyway, his name is Banana Man. If you like what you see, give him a call. You gotta stop listening to all those conspiracy shows. [twists his head] They twist up your noodle so you can't tell what's real. [picks up Princess Bubblegum and places her in the bed of the truck] You want some tea? Bye, Banana Man! Yo, Finn, look what I found! [ Ohh. Well, cut me out, yo! You got anything sharp? They were too long, Finn. Augh! You broke the skin, dude! It's cool, man. I'm gonna take a nap while you grow out your fingernails. We'll make our escape when I wake up. [ It's okay, Finn. You bought us some time. There's nothing! Just a bunch of nature. Alright, one... two... three! Here comes another one. One two three! Good job! Last chance for life. Break out! He feels crazy about making you cry. We're free! Oh, no. You got that look on your face. You going back to help that fool? Spider marriage is complicated. Sometimes, you just gotta mind your own biz. Ugh... Go with Glob. [ Something we're not supposed to see. Nice. Love like theirs will always find a way. It'll crawl all up over you and drain your body fluids, poisoning you slowly until you pass out. [Finn starts screaming and flailing his arms] Circle of life, Finn... circle of life. Should have stuck to your diet! [In baby talk] How about I swaddle you up like a sweet baby. [With Ice King tied to his back] Why'd we do this again? Hmm… That didn't really explain anything. Yeah, this place is deserted, except for that guy. Settle down, prisoner! We gotta record your belongings. One magical crown, [Whispers to Finn] probably stolen. [Running with the crown] Okay! Five counts of jerkateering. Ha! Dude, [Licks him] be calmed by my saliva and think of all the terrible things he's done. The Candy Kingdom! [Sighs] I'm glad that's all taken care of. Awww… This sucks. Man, there are a lot of secret door around here. By getting us to beat the tar out of him. Dude, how are we gonna get those howls? That sounds ominous. I don't like it! We're out of options. Let's just beat it out of him. Hey, what about me? Good job! Those wails must have reached all the way to… Finn, if I came across your lifeless body, I'd clasp you dramatically for a kajillion years. [Grows] Hey, why wait?! Play dead, Finn! Why?! Heh heh heh heh. Why?! Heh heh heh heh. Why?! Hey, man. [Chuckles deviously] Oh, you know, just takin' this garbage bag of butter... [Grunts] ...into the house. [Chuckles again] HAHAHAHAHA! Heh, yeah, I'm a genius. Whatever. I'm gonna take a day long nap. [Yawns and walks towards the door] I might wake up at any moment! Naaaah, I'm still asleep. [Tired] Ahhh, hey, du—AAAAAH! Hey, man, what you doing?! Don't worry, bro. We won't tell anyone about the private time you spend with your wad of Princess Bubblegum's hair. Finn, we're roommates. Which is why I'm gonna share my beloved keepsake with you. Babadadaa! My old baby blanket. That guy must do crazy squats. Can I be the jerk it the band? 'Cause that's an important part of a band's success. [Shrinks face] Hmph. Let's see if you hacks can keep up with my raw talent! Well, I know what's missing. Talent. I'm getting out of here, you hacks! Talentless hacks! [Leaves] Hmph! Shut yo' face. I came back for the music. [Cries] You've all forgotten 'bout the music! I quit the band! [Runs away backwards] I'm just pretending! So hand over our stuff. ...That the real treasure is friendship. Okay, here's that lock of Bubblegum's hair you love so much. And here's Marceline, here's your rock shirt. [Looks up and stops playing] Are you okay, dude? You look bored. Well good, because I'm about to kick it up a notch. Could be anybody. [stretches so that Finn can look out the window] The Ice King?! Yeah! Kick his butt, dude! Whoo, hoo hoo! [To Finn] This is weird, dude. Yeah, good luck with ye and thy creepy wedding. No. No, no, no, no, no. [puts his finger over Finn's mouth] Shhh, I know. I know that you can't have that. Don't worry. [turns to Ice King] Alright, let's go party, Ice King. Have fun being married! But you said you were fine with it! What? Are you serious?! [holding him back] Finn, Finn, cool yourself, buddy. We need to get this guy married, remember? Watch. [walking to Ice King] Let big brother handle this. [poking Ice King] Hey, Ice King? Don't be nervous. Marriage is the most beautiful thing that could ever happen to a jerk like you. [starts sweating] "Why?" [walks back to Finn] Poots, that guy is good. Why? Why? Not now! [to himself] Why, why, why, why, why? Eh, let's cross that bridge when we get to it. Look how happy he is. All that's left is the lousy wedding. [fist bumps Finn] Uh-huh. This wedding looks lame, man. [Ice King is seen on a snow pyramid with some penguins and Snowman Priest] Be prepared to be bored outta your mind. It wasn't me—it was my foot, dude. [points] Look at her ring. Wait a minute! [sighs] So you knew she was cursed all along, which means you knew she wasn't trying to steal your Demonic Eye Junk or whatever, and you knew you had total control of her! So then why did you make us go through all that junk about why marriage is worth stuff?! She wants to marry you because you brainwashed her! Gotcha! Hehe, no problem. Whoa! [bolt freezes him] Hey. Huh? Oh. Oh yeah. Now she's not hypnotized, but we're still frozen. Oh, good. [strains] Wait, what the—? What am I laughin' about? Well, I wouldn't say everything. What's shaking? [From the phone] I can't come to the phone right now. I'm either hanging with Finn, my kids, my GF, or I'm dead. Bye! [Tone] Wha...? What'cha think? It's crazy far, man. Eh, go for it. Not really. What, like, no ladies? Yeah, two people is mad efficient. It's a beach brawl! That's not a barn. That's a dude! You don't want bionic legs. It ain't natchy. Let's discuss this later. Yeah way, we can't! He's the ultimate! Man, I already am a legend in other aspects of life. Third highest score in Kompy's Kastle, bro. [holds up three fingers] Third... in the Candy Kingdom. Okay. How are we gonna beat him, then? He can't even walk. Yeah, I was just kiddin'. Let's destroy that guy! [points to the Farm] [follows Finn] Whoof. [coughs] Let's see your Chokey Brokey Style! [strangled] Nice one. Now watch my... Something Style. [closes his eyes and punches Finn] Huh? Whoo! Uh... yes. Look, I'm a full-grown dog of my own, and I need to play Kompy's Kastle every day so I can maintain my rank. I never really take anything seriously... 'cept Kompy's Kastle. KOMPYYYYY! I'm gonna break every bone in your body, then heal you later with that magical goo we got from the Cyclops' eye! [grows huge fists] AAAH! [smashes Finn] [now giant-sized] [picks up Finn] Apologize! I'm gonna turn up the juice! [gasps] My little face! Ouch! [punches his head where Finn is, but Finn climbs onto his nose] Ow. [punches his nose, but Finn jumps off] Oh! [starts spanking himself] Where are ya? Huh? Huh? [sees Finn] Come out, you chicken nug! [stretches into tree] Ow. Apologize to Kompy's Kastle! Ehh, gross! [groans] Ow! [pushes Finn down and slaps his head] AAH! My eyes! [wiping mud away] Cheap move, you butt rag! Oh! [growing his buttocks] Bring it on, bro! [squishes Finn underneath his buttocks] OUCH! Ow! O-o-o-ow! No bities! [stretches to normal size] Grrrrr! [barks] I'm gonna knock down the Farm just so you'll never know the taste of downing the Farm! The only way you're gonna win is if you use your cheap moves. Hey. [touching Finn's hair] Come on! You gotta fight the dude! Yeah, that's what you get. I do, because peeps need to respect themselves when they leave the house... even if it's just for ice cream, or TP, or whatev. What is going on here, Dream Warrior? Hey, did you dream about Dream Warrior? I don't know; I didn't get it. But listen, man. I'm sorry I got mad at you. Who cares about my high score at Kompy? It ain't important. Well, good thing we're rested, 'cause now we can beat this beast. Dudes came back to watch us fight! Uh, all we did was fight dirty with cheap—wait. Dream Warrior was telling us what cheap moves to use on the Farm! Headlights mean eyes! Give-up-on-life pants! Two golden apples! Well, sure. I can make a wild guess. Yeah, dude! [whispering] Put your pants on. Yeah? Of course, dude. [To Finn] Wait! Let's not be too rash! Just look at this guy! [The reaper chuckles menacingly.] Check out the sunken, lifeless eyes... The foul stench of decay... You know what that means? Well, evil, sure... but mostly, he's unattractive, and unattractive people are desperate. You should haggle with him! [Whispering] Play it cool, Finn. He's here... but he's not you. [Making his fist bigger] We should beat 'im up until he starts makin' sense! Oh, boy! Whoo! Yeah! So am I! It is a lie... and I take full responsibility for it! Yeah! And I am into it! It's, like, gossamer! Yeah, you can! Do what I do! RAAAAWR!! [Increases size then eats broom with ease. He shrinks back to his normal size, but the broom remains the same size.] Oops. [Slightly increases size] Ah, there we go. Haha! Observe my magics! [Rising up] Dude, you got your star, too! Well, that's... sorta cool. Whoo, yeah! Force that enthusiasm! [Slightly removing blindfold] What bowl? [Annoyed] Mmmm, fine... Dude, it's okay. They're just peeled grapes. Nah, I'm good. Eh... I've got everything I need. A limitless supply of mayonnaise, this captivating new hairstyle... and I just learned the best spell of all! Sleep. [Still sleeping] Reflect. [Reflects spell.] Huh?? Full circle!! [Pushes Finn away, groans] I know! We got here six hours early, you dork! Just wake me up when they start selling hot dogs. [sees that he is laying on a hot dog] Whoa! What do you know! [Eee gasp] Boo! You're a loser. But we're not wizards, man. What about the sanctity and honor of Wizard Battle? Ooooh! You don't care about the Ice King. You just wanna kiss Princess Bubblegum. Mm-hmm. Yeah, you do. Yeah, you do. Over there! Okay. When the wizards start to battle, let's go hide behind that rock. Looks like everyone had the same plan. [Pops his head out of the head hole] Whoa. This kid looks like a wimp. Why isn't the Grand Master Wizard seeing this? [Pops out of the shirt] Uh-uh. Whoa. [Comes out from under the cloak] Wow, man. I've never heard you scream like that before. You were all like, "Nooo! No one kisses her but me!" Then stop hiding you feelings, man! Go out there, and smooch it up! [His tail wags] Good job. You got the kiss, man. Don't worry about that, 'cause you look totally cool right now. Okay, am I cool now? Yo, that stinks! Tonight's part 3 of his graveyard secrets workshop. That makes sense. Yeah, I mean, magic's probably more natchy for your body in the long run. Wizards don't play. Yeah, man, this is it. Wo-o-o-o-o-o-o-op! [ Nothing. Just more mountains. I think the wall knows we're not wizards. How do you trick a wall? For reals? That was a nice try, man. Boo. All right, what am I, then? [ Boring. We need a spell for the cold. Dude... What? Dude, don't make me feel any more awkward than I already do! Shush! Whoa, whoa, whoa! We don't want trouble! [while hiding behind a bookshelf with Princess Bubblegum and Finn] That's what you get for asking a magician about his tricks, PB! Psst! Wizards rule! Ridiculous, huh? [ Hey, let's count the days. [ Sleep tight, Princess! Yeah, we still got to heal the snuffins out of Starchie with this little baby here. [ No! Bunk that, I'm tired! C'mon, Finn! Of course, dude! That's Chocoberry. Why are you guys spyin' on Chocoberry? Yo wait! They threw a basketball at my head one time! Are you gonna let that slide?! You sacks! I'll rip your cups! Hmm. Crazy lightbulb hardcore style! Hop on! No Lemongrab. Just an empty room with a catcher's mitt! MARKOVEND

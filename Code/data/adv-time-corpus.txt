 Ha-ha-ha. Okay, now make him look angrier! Alright, give me a second. Nope, not funny anymore. Sorry, dude—you ruined it. Man, I don't have patience for this animation junk. Whoever does this must have no life whatsoev— Oof... Why did I do that? Yo Finn, did you order a brick? Hm, I don't think so. [Reads the floppy disk that is taped to the brick. It says, "Email to Finn + Who's it from? Looks like Ice King's handwriting. Eeeww! Escape, Jake! Escape! Alright, alright, hold on. [ Whaa? Aaaah! Hey, Princess! What now, Ice King? Remember that time last summer when you said you'd only go out on a date with me if I was the last guy on Ooo? I doubt I said that. P-bubs! P-bubs, P-bubs! The computer went... Open video and... The email... Potato trampoline... Brick window with the plastic... Then crashment! Banana hummingbird... 47 grapes! [cleans throat] Anyone having any... [robotic voice] computer problems? [A laugh track plays and stops once How do we stop the computer worm, you pile of goo?! E-ha-ha-ha-ha! My worm exists beyond your comprehension within the universal source code... STOP TALKING LIKE A NERD AND GIVE IT TO US STRAIGHT!!! Once the glitch does its work, the whole world will be deleted! Except for me and my "Bubblygums." [Attempts to kiss Princess Bubblegum, who moves him away with a stick and then throws it at his face.] Ow!! Well, see y'all! I'm gonna prepare for my... date. Ahaha! [Teleports away.] [Crashes out of the door of a house with a glitchy face, running in circles.] AAAAAHH! MY BEAUTIFUL FACE!! MY HOPES AND DREAMS—RUINED!!! [Emits beeps and runs away] Don't worry, Princess, we'll take care of this thing. Oh, me too. [Loads her candy horse tranquilizer] I'm gonna take care of it, too. [Slowly walks away] Okay! [Runs away with Jake] [Grabs Mr. Cupcake] Don't worry, guy! I got you! [Mr. Cupcake disappears.] YEOW! JAKE, HELP ME!!! [talking to Chocoberry] Okay, shh, you're safe! [Chocoberry's arms and legs fell apart then disappeared.] Come here, guy! No... Stay away from me! I'm trying to help you, yo! I saw what happened when you picked up Todd. [Fades away] But... No!! Jake, this isn't working! We need a plan. Aw, man. Okay, here is my dream plan. You were wearin' tights made of green feathers. These tiny green feathers. And I was this wisecracking coelacanth that only ate popcorn. Anyway, we were in this— THAT PLAN'S NOT GOOD! Hold on, I'm almost done. So we were trapped inside this huge egg, and after a while you started dancing in this kind of sign language. And then Ice King's glitchy stuff started eatin' my dream up. I peed in my pants, but you went up and talked to it. You just... talked to it. Then talk to it I will. [Grabs a bit of glitch static from the ground.] Hey man, tell me the haps. Yeah, tell us your feelings! Get deep. "Sllabfoog uoy pleh tnac I..." [running and screaming] OH, SWEET LORD, MY FACE! MY PERFECT...!! Slaw frog yokel snacky. Snacky slaw frog yokel. Sea salt yack let a snacky. Yeah, that sounds good! AAAAAAAAAAH...!!! [Digging in the static.] Jake, I think I found a way in! No, wait, dude. I think I cracked the code! There's no time! [Grabs Jake and enters a portal.] AAAAAAH!!! AAAAH... AAH!!! This must be the universal source code! Huh? Ice King and Bubblegum? Jake! Don't touch anything! Huh? I think the shiny things are the building blocks of the universe, man! They store every single thing that is a thing back on thing! Okay, enough exploring already. Where is this glitch guy? I'm gonna smash his jimmies. [Looks to the front and cringes in fear] Jake, what is it? Oh, Princess Bubblegum? Guess who? Can you guess? Can you? I'll give you 3 chances. No. OK, four chances. [Imitates rimshot] [Stands up] Ice King, give me the anti-virus, or I'll shoot you with my candy horse tranquilizer! But sugar, look what I brought you! A box of chocos! [Eats a chocolate] Hm... Still good. [Box disappears] Argh. Look, I can't prove it, but... [Bubblegum shoots him.] ...you made a promise we'd have at least one date if... [PB shots him twice, and he starts speaking slowly.] ...if I was the last person on Ooo... [ Okay, well, even if I did promised, you're not the last person on Ooo, because I'm still here. [PB starts kissing her left palm.] Well, uh... Ooh, I-I have a hand too, y'know? I can lend you one... [ Oh, that's disgusting. Grrrr!!! Come on, Jake, pull it together, man. Jake? Oh, no, my arm! [grabs arm.] We had so many great times together... Dooby, dooby, dooby, dooby, skeebily, skeebily, dapdy doo... Huh? Who's that? [Sees it was Righty] Awww. [confidently] Let's do this... for Righty! That's the spirit! [Grabs sword.] ADVENTURE TI--!!! [ [Kisses her hand several times, and then licks it, after that, she pushes it away.] ...No. [Continues kissing the hand.] Oh, come on, woman, I'm trying to be nice! Can't you at least make the best out of this? [PB walks to [Stomping Ice King's head.] GIVE ME THE ANTI-VIRUS! I can't, monkey peeps, I didn't make one! The glitch will delete everything until we're all that's last! You mean, forever?! Well, yeah! I mean, you say that like it's a bad thing. Come on, Finn and Jake.... So, hey, Finn, how do you plan on taking this guy out? [voice is muffled by the sword] Okay, I guess it's worth trying. Aah! What we do now? We gotta get those things... outta his stomach. Hey, Finn! Remember that gross video Ice King sent? [disgusted] Ugh, yeah. [confidently] Yeah!! Let's double team these locks! [Bites Finn's hair and starts swallowing it along with Finn. The glitch gets more glitchy. As the glitch roars and starts coughing, it pukes out all of the things it ate from the universal source code. Weird, random stuff starts to happen, it loads and the land of Ooo starts reloading with the candy people. By a pond, Finn and We did it! [They high-five and start coughing.] You should wash your hair! You should wash your mouth! [They start walking as Ice King is seeing the land of Ooo reloading.] Huh? No way! Impossible! [Makes noises and when he moves, the house he was in reloads. His head was already outside of the house, so his head gets stuck in the wall.] Uh... Everything back to normal, huh? Seems like it. [running] Aah! My face!! My beautiful face is back to normal!!! Aaah!!!! [Runs around Finn and Jake, Finn stops him.] Hey, have you seen the princess anywhere? Yes, she's in the Ice King's castle. AUGGH! [Starts running again.] [Destroying Ice King's holographic computer with a baseball bat] Useless-- [Hits it with the baseball bat.] Ugh! --computer!  You sassa-frassin-- Nu!! --hammer-slammin-- Ruh! --wamma-jammin... [Stomps on the computer.] Ugh! [elbow drops on it as the table collapses.] Ugh! [Hits the computer twice.] Ah-ya-ya-ya-ya! [Hits it hard. She sees Finn and Jake.] Finn and Jake! [Throws the baseball bat away.] My heroes! [Picks them up and hugs them.] Yeah, no big deal. Geez... [PB and I missed you! I missed you, too! [They kiss.] Whoa, you taste different, baby! You been playin' basketball in someone else's hockey rink? Ahem... Hey, Bubs, where's the Ice King? I wanna kick his boingloings! Yeah. Where is he? I wanna kick his boingloings, too! Uh... guys? Hello? Princess. Uh... Let's forget all about this... [the snake-spider hybrid wanders onscreen and bites Hey, brother. Pass me that jam, won't you? Sure. Thanks. So, how is your toast? Pretty good. Funny, though, I can kind of taste the toast's emotions or something. Getting ground into flour and then made into bread really did a number on this wheat's sense of self. That's a pretty hyper‐developed sense of taste you've got there. Hey, you seem kind of different. Nope. Same old You're blue, you've got those five eyes, you're way bigger, and you keep discovering strange new abilities. I think this might be a situation. Where's this coming from [Gasps] Whoops! Tuck‐tuck. See? Same old Ahhh! Whoa. [ Ahhh! Jake is a crab! Ahhh! [ Same old Jake. If you say so. Hmm. I think I'm handling these minor changes pretty well. Besides, a lot of people are different these days. Dirt Beer Guy, you're practically a zombie. How are you dealing with it? Well, I'm basically the same as before. The difference is only physical. So you agree Finn is really overreacting? Totally. You're the same person as before. Heck yeah! I'm still the same old Wait, you're Jake?! Uh, pardon me. Oh, dear, oh, dear. That's really something. You know, I think I figured out why I make people uneasy. They're used to yellow [Speaks Korean] 자기야, 내가 좀 고쳐볼게. (Babe, I'll try to fix it.) [then tries (and fails) at changing Jake's color] [Laughs] Lady, that tickles. [Speaks Korean] 젠장! (Damn!) It's okay, lady. Thanks for trying, but I'm fine, really. [Speaks Korean] 어떤 일이 일어나도 나는 널 사랑해. (I love you no matter what happens.) I love me, too. Jermaine? Ahh, mountain colors. I'm painting this mountain. I think it's really coming together. That's the mountain? Yep. I'm a mirror. Hey, who's your friend? [Warren Ampersand appears] Yipe! Dad? Look at this. [Playing with a yoyo] I can almost walk the dog. Your body looks like one of my paintings. Pretty weird dream, huh? This isn't just a dream body, this is what my body looks like when I'm awake. Oh. Got it. Ha! I've got it! What? [Now with 5 eyes, and 8 arms, each holding a yoyo] I can almost walk the dog. Finn, you up? Yeah, man. I had a really bad dream last night. So ominous. These images are going to haunt me for, like, forever. Sometimes it helps me if I draw a bad dream in picture form. My crayons! It was a weird scene, all right. Chanting ladies, labyrinths, classical sculpture. And Jermaine was there, too. The weird thing was that he was painting abstract art. So? F.Y.I., Jermaine hates abstract art. He would never paint something non‐representational. Maybe he's just trying something new? It's not in his nature. Why would he all of a sudden get into painting meaningless shapes? He's probably fine. Just feels so out of character, you know, for Jermaine. How's the drawing? Just squiggles. [Playing a game on BMO] Fuelish tank! You are too slow for the [Looks at a postcard of the mountain Jermaine was painting] I knew I had seen that mountain. [Scoffs] Tank boys,you have no hope. [Laughs] [ Vrrt‐vrrt‐vrrt! Brrt! Who goes there?! James, it's me, You look nothing like Jake, but I believe you. I just have to ask because I'm supposed to guard the Wasteland. I was just making some beans. Come to my tent! Okay, but I don't want any beans. [Laughs] Man! I could eat beans all day, every day. [Gasps] Where did you get that painting? One day when I was guarding, I saw Jermaine painting it. You like this? It doesn't look anything like a mountain. I think you're looking at it wrong. Where'd Jermaine go...after? He went back to his studio, behind the wall of water. You mean a waterfall? No, like the thing I said. [Laughing] Hey! None but the chosen may walk beyond the wall of water. What have you done with my brother? Who's your brother? Jermaine. Wow. You guys don't look anything alike. We're practically twins. Well, I guess you can walk beyond the wall of water. But just this once. Ooooh! [He opens himself up, creating a doorway to Jermaine's house. Bryce climbs up from the floorboards] Can I help you, sir? [Chuckles] Hey, Bryce. I'm looking for Jermaine. Is he behind that door marked "private"? No, no, no. Mr. Jermaine won't be seeing anyone today. His wishes for privacy were quite explicit. You wouldn't want to interrupt Mr. Jermaine. He's a brilliant painter. Yeah, he used to be. Now you got him painting all this nonsense. I'm just his humble dealer. So many times I've watched him painting, painting, painting. What's really going on, Bryce? My dad told me all about your demon tricks. Well, now I don't want to say anything bad about your dad, but... Bro? I'm here to save you. Hmm? Oh, hey. I'm not sure if this is done yet. It's hard to tell when an abstract is finished. Jermaine, what's wrong with you? Who's taken away your identity as a landscape painter? There's nothing wrong with me, Jake. I just changed a little. You seem like you've changed a little bit, too. No, I just look different. Eh, that sounds like denial. No, it doesn't! Come on, bro. Nothing's different! I'm the same! Same old This looks bad, but deep down,I'm not different. And you're not different either, right? You'll go back to painting landscapes? No one is making me do this. I painted so many landscapes that the shapes of the land began to lose their meaning. And the shapes broke apart to me, so I painted them like that. And it's not like my new paintings erase my old paintings. They're both me. Okay. I think I'm starting to get it. I like the new look, by the way. 'Cause you like your brothers to be crazy shapes? Sure. Also, Dad told me you might go through some changes one day. Huh? He told me to be supportive. But I would've done that anyway. I wonder what he meant. You knowhow secretive Dad was. Sorry I don't have more answers. Well, do you have any more of these paintings? The shapes are always changing. Changing is their normal state, like us. Even if we're not changing on the outside, we're changing on the inside constantly. There's some stuff about me that I've been ignoring for a long time. I'm afraid of that stuff. But it's part of who I am. As long as I know the shape of my soul, I'll be alright. Wow. You really understand my art. Oh, I totally don't understand anything. Hey, you're back. Yeah, I went to see Jermaine. He says hi. No, I mean, like,you're really back. Huh? Different, yet the same. Hey, Jake, do you think you should date someone just like you or someone who’s like your opposite? I don’t know. I’m the "first come first serve" kinda guy. Get in line, ladies! This Rainicorn thing can’t last forever! [chuckles] [Magic Man peeks out from under a strip of grass, unnoticed by Finn and So it’s not good to weigh someone’s qualities against your own? Well, no. I mean, if you feel something, you feel something! [ Alright, well, what about BMO and Ice King? What about them? [Looks confused] Would they make a good couple? Whoa! Wait! Did BMO say something to you? No no! Oh, I see. You’re being weird. It’s not that weird! Come on! Do what thoust will be the whole piece of Law. BMO and Ice King? Yeah! I’m not coming back. [Retreats into his hole] You’re creepin’ me out. [Gets up] I’m just thinkin’ out loud. [Jake starts walking away and Oh, is that what you’re doing? Yeah man! Pffft, jeez don’t be judgy. I’m not! Yeah, you are! How could you know that? I can hear it in your tone. You can? [in a mocking tone] Yeah, wise-guy. [Pointing to the bag] Hey, what’s that in your pants? [Looking at the back of his pants] What?! Not again! [ Crazy. [Finn opens the bag and reaches in] Careful, dude. What the--? [ What the heck?! Are they alive?! [They are now moving around aimlessly] Hey, are you guys alive? [BMO starts to fall off, but Jake catches him] I don’t know, man, I think they’re some kind of magic toy. Maybe it’s black magic. Maybe we shouldn’t mess with them. No, man, look! That’s you! [Jake is playing the viola with Lumpy Space Princess on his back and Yeah, that’s good. How many more thingies are in there? [Looks in the bag] Dude. Like a lot. Come on! Let’s check this out at the house. [They run towards the house] I’ll make a special spagot [spaghetti] with a new sauce. Sheesh. So many. PB, you hang out with Lady. [Picks up Princess Bubblegum and moves her towards Lady] C-listers, go back in the bag. [Pushes Xergiok, Donny, Tiffany, Lemongrab, one of the Gumdrop lasses, and'Turtle Princess] [stirring the noodles] Who’s in the C-list? [Adds something, possibly wine, from a bottle, then dumps some spaghetti onto each plate] Tiffany, Donny. [To himself] Well, he’s okay. [Out loud] Xergiok... a bunch o' these guys! That’s not very nice. [Turns off the stove and brings the food to the table] Don’t worry, man. They’ll get involved eventually. Involved with what? [Sits down and gives Finn his food] I don’t know. Involved. Check out Lady and Princess Bubblegum! [Stretches to get forks. Lady and Princess Bubblegum are having a conversation. It looks as though Princess Bubblegum is asking Lady questions] What are they talkin’ about? It’s hard to say, but I think it’s got something to do with Lady being preggos [pregnant]. Whoa! What kinda narrative are you trying to create here?! That’s your narrative, buddy. Alright, well, what else ya got goin’ on? Hmm. Not much really. I got Ice King over here. [Points to Ice King] Ice King? He’s not C-list? [Looking through the bag to find Ice King's drum kit] Yeah, well, I saw his drum kit in here. Here we go. [Puts it in front of Ice King] Okay, jam out, little Ice King. [Ice King starts playing] [Little Chemistry... Hey, Finn, eat the food before it gets cold. [Pops up from behind Flame Princess and Lumpy Space Princess] I made a new sauce! Umm, earth to Finn, are you okay? Yeees. Whoooooa. [ I didn’t sleep. [Very blunt and tired] [Comes back to the table with a drink in a mug] You stay up all night readin’ trash books? [Finn makes a weak “meh” sound.] I told you, man. Those datin’ books. [Sips drink] That stuff is mess you up. [Drinks again] I’m not reading. I’m playing with the little wees. Oh, let me see little me. [Stretches his head to find little Uh, you guys broke up. [Confused] Wha? She’s with someone else now. [Angry] Who?! He’s a cool guy, don’t worry about it. [Hears Lady laughing and goes to the source. He finds little Finn in Lady’s lap kissing under a book teepee] Ahhhhhh! [Slams his fists on the table] What the ball, man?! [Laughs and shrugs; he doesn’t sound as worn out as before] What? What? What do ya think “what”?! Come on, they’re not real, they’re like toys. These guys here, they’re goin’ out. [Points the Marceline and Peppermint Butler in a tea cup. Marceline licks the red off of Peppermint Butler’s side.] Pretty serious. And look at Choose Goose and Lollipop Girl. They’re still testing the waters. [Choose Goose and Lollipop Girl are dancing and are joined by Abracadaniel] But I think things are gonna work out. Check out Xergiok and Turtle P. [Turtle Princess is seen lightly spanking Xergiok. [slowly backs towards the exit] I don’t like where you’re going with this. It ain’t wholesome. I’m gonna go to Lady’s for a few days. To clear my head. [Leaves] Okay. Whatever whatevs. [Goes over to little I’m back! I got over all that messed up stuff you did. [The tree house is covered in trash and Finn looks awful] Yeesh. You okay, man? I don’t know. What’s little Finn doing? He’s... thinking. [Looks concerned] He looks sad. What’s he thinking about? I don’t know. Probably lots of stuff. Where’s little Rainicorn? Probably still crying. Wha? She’s not handling the break-up very well. [sees Lady still crying in her teepee] Aww. PB's good, though. [Princess Bubblegum is on a weight bench lifting weights and she has become very toned. She looks very angry.] After little This is messed up, dude. You’ve crossed the line from weird curiosity to some dark messed up stuff. [Looks perturbed] I know! [Marceline has licked away half of Peppermint Butler] The destruction! [Xergiok looks like he’s in pain and Turtle Princess is furiously spanking him] The depravity! [Choose Goose, Abracadaniel, and Lollipop Girl are all tangled up together] The wrongness of it all! I’m taking that bag back to the cliff where we found it. [Tries to grab them but Finn grabs his arms.] No, man! I gotta fix this mess! Look at me, man! I’m staring into the shadow of my darkest mind hole! I gotta help him! You can’t! Just let them do their own biz, man! I junked them up too hard though! I gotta step in! How would ya do that? [Lets go of his arms and Jake steps back] I’m gonna talk to him. But he can’t hear you. Yeah, why is that? Hmm. Maybe we’re on different dimensional planes and the border between our planes is like a two way mirror. So we can see him, but he can’t see us. [Gets really close to little Try shakin’ him. Why? Maybe we’re vibrating on different intervals. Try shakin’ him at different speeds and see if he responds. [Grabs him and starts shaking] Okay. Fiiiiiiinn! Fiiiiiiiiiinn! Now go faster! FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINN! Faster! [The cloud Go slower, he saw you! Okay. [In the Little People’s world] Fiiiinn. Can you hear me? Wah wah wah. Whoa! Neat! I made you do those crummy things. I’m why yous guys is fighting. I’m the big you. I came to apologize. I will never interfere with your lives again. [Little Now what? [shaking Lady, Princess Bubblegum, and Flame Princess at the same time and they all see the cloud] Hey, ladies! This is big Is that gonna do it? [The little people join the party and start dancing] Get the C-listers out. [They begin dancing as well] Good party. Oh, flip! [BMO and the Ice King are dancing] Look who’s hittin’ it off with the Ice King! [Chuckles] What the... [she breaks the seal on the letter and reads it aloud] "mmmmn Hey Finn! Hey Jake! Can you come up here? I have a job for you! Okay! [getting up] Sorry CB, we'll finish this up later. [entering room] Hey, Preebs. Hey, guys. I got a letter from the earls of Lemongrab. They've gone through all the food that I've sent them. [gestures to case] This case contains precious candy seeds for the Lemongrabs to grow new food. [closes case] So, I need you two to deliver these seeds to Lemon Castle. [hands case to Jake] For sure. We'll do it. [saluting] Good luck, gentlemen! [waving] Bye, girlfriend! [laughs] Hey, Lemongrabs! You home? Holy--! [worried] Jake? Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake! [smacking a Lemon spider off his arm] Kiss it! Aah! Sorry, dudes--got no food! No... food! [Lemon goat bites Hey! Weirdos! [stretches his hand into a slice of cake] Get the birthday cake! Are you lemon? Whoa! What the thing is up with this guy? Does your head come to a nub? What? You are un-lemon. Yeah. Cool, man. Hey, do you know where--? I am Wait, what? They're quite hungry. Yeah. What the heck's going on here? There is no food, only Lemons--Lemons with bellies empty but for lemon lusts! Whatever, Lemonjon. We've gotta give those dumb-butts these seeds. Where should we go? Mmmmmmmy senses tell me that they're in the dungeon. They've been there for three weeks. Three weeks, dungeon. I wonder who put them in there. I don't know, but we gotta bust them out! Which way to the dungeon, Lemonjon? Oh, cool! [running to hole] Thanks, man! [going through hole] Yeah, thanks, man! [turns around] Hmmm. Hmmm. [opening door] Yo, Lemon-wipes! Yech. Um, maybe we should hands... for safety. [taking Jake's hand] Yeah, sure! So, where'd you want to look ne--[looks at what he's holding, which turns out to be a green Lemon creature that starts licking his hand.] Eeeh! [yanks hand away] Uh, Finn?! [down the hall] Oh, sorry dude. [opening door] Stay close to me. [closes door] Nope! [running to door] I think this is it. [ratting handle] All locked up! [looks through bars] There they are! Hey, Lemongrabs, we're here! We're gonna get you out, just hold tight! Go away. No food here. Maybe the kidnapper's in there, too, coercing them. Probably the grossest one of all, too--beet red skin, barf, poopin' all its junk-sculpture. Ah, stop, man! You're just makin' it worse! [makes fist huge] Let's just get this over with. [punches down door] Lemongrabs, you're free! They broke the door! The door is broken now! FIX THE DOOR! Fix the door? What?! What? Fix the door? Fix--what? What's goin' on here? Fix the door. Finn, what's goin' on? Fix the door. It doesn't matter anymore. There is no more candy to hoard. Let them keep what crumbs they find, for there are no crumbs. [Half screaming, half singing] NO CRUMBS! Are you saying you locked yourselves down here with all the food so you could eat it yourselves? You know there's guys starvin' up there?! Hmm. No, no. You do not understand. It is not us for whom they starve, but them... ...for whom they starve. Mm! Yes, yes! For the candy food was not consumed--no, no--but was given life! Wha--? You see, Finn, [starts pacing] when Mother Princess last visited ...when she saw fit to create me, Lemongrab... [holds up formula]...she left behind a little something-something the secret formula for creating candy life! She must have meant for us to have it, to keep making more family. Yes, yes! All her fault! What? What'd you say? I said, "all her fault." Oh, indeed! For once we had commenced, how could we desist? I looked deep in myself and found that I'm a guy who can't stop making candy life from the food he needs. Me, too. It just felt so pretty okay inside, greeting each new placid face... ...and hearing each new piercing song! [screams] We used the last of the food to make Plop-Top, here. Mm. I thought we said Dump-Dome. [screams] Who cares anyway? They've brought no food! We're all going to die! Look. We brought these seeds. [opens case] They're special candy seeds. You can grow new food now. [walks over] Oh, yes. [taking seeds] Hmm, mm-hmm, mmhm. Yes. [pushes Plop-Top off of table, squishes seeds together] Yes, yes. There we go! [pours formula onto wad] Ha-haaa! We'll call you Seed-Wad! [admiringly] Ooh! You really are gonna die. ...and all your boys, too! Our... boys? Come on. We'll take you to see Princess Bubblegum. She knows more about candy than anyone; she built a whole kingdom out of candy! Yes. Okay. For our boys. But first we will notify the children of our impending departure... ...so they won't worry about us while we're away. Okay, yes. The hard times are over! Mmmm, here's the plan... We will go to the Candy Kingdom and take all their candy from them! Then we will give that candy precious life and build a candy army so we may then go forth and pillage candy for all to eat! Now go, young Lemonjon! Go! Go! What's going on, Lemongrabs?! It's all [points finger at Finn] your fault! [points finger at Finn] All your fault! We warned you! We warned you about us! Yaaaah! [pants, looks down at Lemonjon's leg] What the--? [as Lemonjon starts walking] Whoaaaaaa! Jake! Are you alright? Yeah, but look! [points] He's heading right for the Candy Kingdom! [gasps] And he's too big to duke it out with! Unless... Giant poison candy aspirin! [holds up large pill] I've got this one, but it might be too small. No. We'll kick him in his heart 'til he's history. Those must have been Lemonjon's guts we saw before. His heart is his weak spot. Yeah, but we'll never find it again in time... unless that's it there [points] with the juice coming out. Remember all that juice, from before? Oh yeah, that's probably it. [Jake stretches them over to the grate] Whoaaa! [ [climbing in] Tastes like vitamins. [grunting and punching the heart] Are you sure this is it? It's not even doing anything. Just smash it already, grandma. Right. [grows hands and hits the heart hard] [sarcastically] Oh, nice one, Jake. [stops walking] Whoa, hold the phone! What is this powerful new juice coursing fromst my core source? [groans] The juice aches. Is this the rumored ache of feeling? The feeling of caring unknown to Lemons? New thoughts emerge! If I act, the Candy People will suffer. If I don't, the Lemon people will suffer. The greater good demands but one course only that I dissolve the bonds uniting me and become component to all! Whoa, dang! [picks up some candies] That Lemonjon turned himself all up into lemon candy! Man, that Lemonjon's all right. [erasing] ...and... there... we... go. [blows on Lemongrab's brain] All done! The last trace of the candy life formula is out of their heads! ...and I snatched this [holds up formula] out of the Lemon castle, boyee! Now we all just have to keep a closer eye on those two so they don't get in to any more trouble. But how come we don't just fix their hearts like we did with Lemonjon so they're more selfless and less selfish? Oh, no, no. Their hearts are fine. They're just like this. [smiling] Hmm! [Lifts up door] Ugh! [Whispering] Good morning [Smooch]... Good morning [Smooch]... Good morning [Smooch]... [Angrily] Drank up! [Whispering] Forever young. [Opens cabinet door] AIIIIIIIII...! [Screech] Oh! Ooh I'm so simmering! I'm so... I'm so... Ooh! I'm so mad! A rat in the flour?! A rat in the flour?! I'm so smoked! I'm a hot log! I gotta thumb war! Thumb war! [Sticks thumb at rat] Aahhhh! [Muffled] Aahhhh! Finn! [Wakes up] What?! [Feels lip] My lip hurts again. [Inconsolable] Finn! Finn, I ha—I hav—I have a boo-boo! Kiss it. [Nonchalant] Okay! [Kisses BMO's thumb] That tastes like rat. [Sulking] What's worse than You! [Screech] Thumb war! [Punches rat in the nose] I WIII... ... IIIIN! [Takes a spoonful of cereal and munches twice.] [Slurps] Huh? I was just sipping my coffee. Oh. [Takes a spoonful of cereal and munches twice.] [Slurps] [Munching] [Slurp] [Munching] [Slurp] I am also excited about today. Oh, yeah? Today is the first day of my new job. What's your new job, BMO? Yeah, are you a spy? You know, 'cause of the overcoat? I'm a door-to-door salesman. [Together] Oh. What are you selling? I've got so many great things. Like for the man about town, this piece of lint. I'll take it! [He takes the lint.] Hooray, my first sale! That'll be four doubloons. Can I pay you later? Mm, the customer is always right! Good attitude, BMO. Well, gentlemen... got to chop that wood. [Whispering to Jake] It's Ice King. [Whispering back] I know. [Peeks his face out the front of the overcoat and spots that Finn and Jake have seen him.] Oh! [He quickly closes the overcoat.] [Exiting] Okay, wish me luck, fellas, even though I don't need- [Together] Aww. Boy, this is great, huh? You and me out in the fresh air? Now, the key to being a tip-top salesman is to get the ol' foot in the door. Bodies don't talk, Ice King. Well, mine does. Okay, then. If I say "My feet hurt," you can go "Woof woof." That's my dogs barking. BMO, I think we're gonna make an unbeatable team. Yeah, yeah! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! [Kicking the sides of Ice King's head and laughing.] [Reading as she types on a typewriter] "Chapter 3 No Time For Sleeping. Elizabeth's heart was racing like a water mill after spring thaw. She knew her enemies were coming for her, but when? Suddenly, there was a knock at the door." Oh! Oh. Oh, my goodness. Someone's at the door. That's all. [She opens the door, finding BMO and Ice King.] Hello. Tree Trunks, how are your children? Can you believe this weather? [After some fumbling, Ice King tips So polite. Please, please come in. [Taking a seat] You have a lovely home. Here, have some apple pie. Oh, thank you. Now what can I do for you? Oh, well, I'd like to show you what I'm selling today. Okay, we have a broken branch, a half-eaten sandwich - oh, another ball of lint. Another? These are selling like red hots. A dust bunny - That's like a cage-free ball of lint. A doll's head, and a little velvet bag, tied tight at the top. I'll take the branch. My loose cash is up there in the flower jar. Help yourself. [Laughs happily as Ice King tosses the money wad from hand to hand. Tree Trunks joins the laughter, not really paying attention as she has been distracted by the branch.] You have a lovely home! [Ice King falls out the door and they both scream as they exit.] [Entering] What'd you buy, honey bunch? A branch. Huh. [Tree Trunks turns him around and starts scratching his back with the branch.] Huh? Oh. Ah, Tree Trunks, you're a financial genius. [Laughing as he and Ice King leave the orchard.] I can't believe we unloaded that branch. It wasn't even our best one. Oh, my. Shield my eyes from the sun. Why? Because I think I see our next customer. [They watch a large chipmunk carrying a couple of acorns.] Those nuts could be ours. Excuse me, little boy! How are your children?! Ice King, duck. Jump. Right. Right again. [Laughs] Left. Jump, jump. Left. Right. Left. Ice King, you're doing so good. You have not bumped into anything. BMO, where's the customer? Oh, no. I was so excited about you not bumping into anything, I lost the customer. Ice King, I think we are lost. Look. A house. All I see is the inside of this coat. And... stop. Knock politely. Mysterious sentinel, you have a lovely home. [Whispering to Ice King] Turn. [Continues talking to the mysterious figure] How are your children? [ Hello. I'm a door-to-door salesman, ma'am. [Chuckling] Oh, excuse my indigestion. [He kicks Ice King.] Ouch. I have some wonderful new products, like, uh, this ball of lint. No, wait, this is the dust bunny. Uh... Oh, oh! I know - this velvet bag. Did I mention that it contains Finn's teeth? Please, let's go in the parlor, where we can be more comfortable. And you're sure these are Finn's teeth? Yes. The same Finn who serves Princess Bubblegum, obstructs my plans, and plagues my thoughts? Yes. Finn the Human's teeth? That's a [Whispering] Psst! Does Finn know you have his teeth? Because I don't think- [Interrupting] Hey! I'm trying to close a sale here. I hope you accept silver. I can pay you immediately. [Admiring the teeth] Yes, my pretties. Poor little guy. Still wearing out the shoe leather trying to make just one more lousy sale before coming home. He'll feel better after we have a little party for him. Still, it's tough seeing your kid get his heart set on doing something he really sucks at. Hello, boys. Meet the salesman of the year. Or maybe of the decade. The Chinese food is on me. I mean, check out the loot. [Ice King hands Finn a silver goblet.] [Whispering to Jake] It's real. What the heck did you sell to get this silver goblet? Just a line of smooth talk and pipe dreams. Oh, and a set of human baby teeth. Where did you even get a set of human baby teeth? [Suddenly realizing] Human baby teeth!! [He rushes up to the bedroom and retrieves a box from a drawer. It's empty.] BMO! Branches and lint are moving like cray, Jake. Oh, sure, I sold your baby teeth. I could sell any part of you. These were, like, the only things I had left from when I was a little kid. Hey, you know what? We'll just go buy back those little pearly whites. I'm sure whoever bought them is like, "Why did I buy these things?" What possible use could some guy have for a set of human baby teeth? Unless he's an evil sorcerer or a mad scientist... He wasn't a mad scientist, was he? Well... [High pitch shriek] Stay back, baby [Groans nervously] They're made out of some kind of hard tooth-like material. Ouch. Ouch! Ice King, freeze these nightmare babies. I'm not allowed to wear my crown. It's against BMO's dress code. Just don't let them climb into your mouth! Hey, there, bitey boys. Get off of there. [More babies attack Hmm. Maybe I sold too well. Hey, you're a great salesman. Evil babies are not a problem for you. They're an opportunity. Yeah. Where did I put those - Oh, here they are. [Ice King pulls out a couple of sledgehammers.] Gentlemen, could I interest you in a couple of sledgehammers? Perfect for smashing through minerals or composites. [Being gnawed by babies] I'll take one. Me too! Great decision. A little tap is all it takes. [Smashing babies] These baby-smashing hammers are great. I'm sorry I caused such a mess. It's very bad for business. Well, time to call it a day. [He pulls out a clocking-in machine and a punchcard, and clocks out, then places a small hat atop his crown.] The ice man leaveth. Hey, wait. See you tomorrow, partner. [They shake hands.] Until tomorrow. Yeah, you're not doing this tomorrow. Hmm. In retrospect, the attack would have worked much better were they not baby teeth. [Clears throat.] One free-range Humpty Dumpty. Sorry. Fine aged cheddar man. Homemade ketchup. A fresh pepper fart Dance, parsley. Face bread. Special sentient sandwich. Mmm... Is that special sentient sammich? Bingo. Made by the BMO, you're my little cherub. You know that? You made all this for me, right? Aaahhh. Not so fast, Jake! Naaaw. The sammiches are yours... For a price. What? I need you to be my tiny horse for the day, so I can do my live-action cowboy role-play adventure. No way. Poo deal. I'll do 20 minutes. It took me over six hours to prepare this nosh, Jake! Not to mention the time it took acquiring the ingredients through the "special market," putting my safety and my reputation on the line. Okay, fine, fine. Three sammiches for every hour I'm a horse. Mm... One sammich per horse-hour, six-hour minimum. Deal. Yippee-ki-yay! Om! Mm. Oh, yeah. It tastes alive. Steed yourself, partner. Okay. Om. 'Kay. Oh, come on, man. You didn't even try. I did try. Horses are hard. How's that? Eh, it reads. Steady, girl. Wha... Shh, shh, shh. I'm going to mount you now. Hup! Good girl. So, what's the plan anyway, BMO? The plan is to punch the toads to the stump and bring justice to the peeps! Ow. Oh, and by the way, Jake, from now on, you can call me... Angel Face. Hyah! Yow! I used to be a guy who ran from Glob with the wind at my back and the devil on my shoulder. Now I'm the guy chasing those guys, yet the devil is still here, sleeping in my couch. BMO, that hurt when you dug your boots into my side belly. Are you gonna apologize or... Horses do not talk. Over there! Hyah! Whoa! Jackrabbit Johnson. This guy's wanted for stealing piglets from their mothers while they are feeding. Makes me sick. He was last seen in dead goat gulch. What do you say, girl? Want to catch this donkey and split the reward? You have 45 minutes left before my next sammich. Time's a-wasting! Hyee! Hmm. BMO, I'm tired. Looks like my horse needs a rest. Slow down, horse. ♪ Being a robot cowboy ♪ ♪ Is a lonely job ♪ ♪ But somebody has to protect the piglets ♪ ♪ I got nobody but my horse ♪ ♪ And my friend the cactus guy ♪ ♪ It's okay because I like them a lot ♪ ♪ That's okay, I like being a robot ♪ ♪ Cowboy ♪ Be careful, Jake. This is where Jackrabbit Johnson's gang of lowlife bandits lays low. Hyah! Bang! Bang! Put them up, partner! Hyah! Pyew, pyew! Pyew, pyew, pyew! I want answers! [high voice] You can't do this to us! No answers, eh? No use to me! How about you, frisco? [high voice] I'm not going to talk. Why am I talking to you then?! Hooah! Yah! Unh! BMO, what did you do? It's Jackrabbit Johnson's right-hand man, Tumbleweed Terk. I spent the last three months building all of this. Oh, that's where you been? Mm-hmm. BMO gave me a Finn Cake. Don't talk to my horse, Tumbleweed. Aah. Where is Jackrabbit Johnson?! I know you know where he's headed. I don't know! Tumbleweed terk's always the last to know. It's just like I told the other bounty hunter, I swear. I don't believe a word you say. Now take a message to your compadre. Tell him his pal, Angel Face, is itching to get together. Tell Jackrabbit Johnson to meet me at Dirtwater Flats, just like the old days! Okay. Sock citizens of dead goat gulch, we can rebuild! Neigh! Grrr. Uhh... I don't remember where Dirtwater Flat is. Better stop for the night. We can make a campfire here. And we will talk about what we will do with the reward money. No. It's been fun, BMO, but it's time to go home because there are no more sandwiches. But I want to finish the adventure. Which direction is the house? I'm not sure. Get down! Getting kicked out of the guild of assassins... check. Capturing my first bounty... Check. Going to Finn and Jake's treehouse and getting revenge... Unchecked.  Mm-hmm. Who are you, and why do you want to get revenge? I... Am... Me-Mow?! Whoa. You've gotten bigger. Have we met before? Finn, is that you? That's Jackrabbit Johnson! Finn? It is Finn! Tricked again! Look... It's me-mow, BMO. I don't care. That's my bounty! Yaah! Jake, transform... Horse! Whoa, did you have a real gun all this time? I am old enough to vote. [thinking] Hey, Jake, if you can hear my internal monologue, I'm going to kill you! Your Daisy days are over! I am the whaler 'round these parts! Huh. Sounds like you're out of ammo. No, you heard incorrectly. Bang, bang, bang! I'm coming for you! Ugh! Blast you, Finn and Jake and Angel Face. This prison cell's not going to hold me. Oh? Hey, Finn and Jake! I'll get my revenge! You hear me?! Revenge! Hey, BMO, are you sure you took down all the wanted posters? Yes. Stick 'em up. Huh? This bounty belongs to me! Get out of here! Yaah! Thanks, BMO. You're welcome. Jake! Jake! Good mornin'! Whatcha doin', buddy? Meditating. What are you meditating about, dude? Wait, dude. I'm connecting to the internet with my mind. Ha ha! Beep boop boop boop beep boop. Check it out—I downloaded a little dance. [Begins to dance] Huh, I like it. Yeeoow! [Starts to dance, too] Whoa! Algebraic! Look! It's Princess Bubblegum's rainicorn! She looked like she was crying. Well, let's go cheer her up. To the max! Yeah! Yeah, let's do it! Woo hoo! [Grows huge] Rrrrroar! [Crying] Hey! What's wrong!? [Still crying] Wanna hear a funny joke!? [Cries even louder] Knock-knock! [Cries frantically] Who's there? [Cries even more] Woowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoo, who? [Cries and flies away] Man, that wasn't very funny. She's flying into the Ice Kingdom. Aw, the Ice King is an oxymoron. Seriously... but what are we gonna do? Survey the situation. What's up? The Ice King is throwing frozen lightning bolts at the Rainicorn. [Puts on the binoculars] That guy is a total patoot. He's like 50 patoots! Whoa! And there's Princess Bubblegum! [sigh] The Ice King is always stealing princesses. We're going in turbo time! [puts on a sweater] You want your booties? Yes, please. [Jumps in the air] Howop! [Booties are thrown up into What time is it? Adventure time!  Mathematical! That was totally math! Rhombus! Iceclops! Did somebody say my name? That was close! Oh, my goodness! Let's rock and roll! [Roars] Ice to meet you! [Throws snowballs at it] Hey, cut it out! Snow Golem! [Baby sounds] Elemental! I'm lost. Can you direct me towards the sun? That way. What? Oh, geez, duh! Thanks. Snow problem! [Throw snowballs at him] [moans] Oh, real nice! How old are you? I'm 12 years old! I'm 28! Hey, Ice King! Stop it! Heh? Stop meddling, boy! You and your magical dog can't harm me. He's not my dog! He's my friend! [Jumpkicks Ice King in the face] Hey, how's it goin'? My name's [Coos like a pigeon] Why are you always stealing ladies? I'm going to make one marry me! [Cackles] That's... stupid! Your hat is stupid! My hat is awesome! [Jumpkicks him again] Where's Jake? [To Lady Rainicorn] Are you kidding? I play the viola too. [Coos] You are crazy. You are so crazy. [With ice lightning in his hands] Now I've got you, boy! [Freezes Pen] What's going on? Ab...Abraham Lincoln? Pen, your mind has been transported back in time... and to Mars. What? It doesn't matter, but what does matter is you need to believe in yourself. [Breaking out of the ice] Never! Pen! Princess! Let's go! Heh? Yay! Nwah. How dare they trifle with me. They can't possibly think they can win! Hey, sloppy milkshake! Wha? Why don't you pick on someone your own size? Fool! Your powers are no match for my magical crown! [falling] My powers! Foul and noisome whelp! You've not seen the last of my wintery fangs! I'll cleave the warmth from your bones and stop still your beating heart with my claaaaws... There you go, Princess. You are free. Oh, thank you, brave knight. Oh, I'm not a knight. I'm a boy. Well, then, thank you, brave boy. [Kisses Pen on the forehead and he blushes] Ha ha ha ha ha! Whoa, what is going on? Uh, nothing. [Giggles] [Pushes Jake along] We got to go, okay, bye, Princess. Bye. Go where, dude? We don't have anything to do. Heh, heh, yeah we do, buddy. Adventure awaits. I don't see any adventures going on anywhere. I think we're good to just sit here for a while and just talk about our feelings. Heh, uh, look! Those ninjas are stealing that Old Man's diamonds! Give me back my diamonds! Later, Princess! I have to attend to this! Fair thee well, Pen and Jake. Jake! What time is it? Adventure time! [Talking to the viewers] Oh, hello. [laughing] Here for more graybles, I presume. Well you've come to the right computer-fable. Feast your eyes-mabel, on my holo-pyramid viewer and— [A bird passes by him singing] Huh? What's that? Not in the mood for graybles, you say? Oh dear. You okay? Did something fatlabel happen to you? [A bird sits on Oh, hello again! As you can see, the bird-house is nearly complete! All that's left is where the door hole goes. But I can't remember. [Starts scratching his head with a hammer] Hm. Door hole. Wait! I just remembered! My door hole solution lies in one of tonight's scheduled graybles! Would you mind I look through them to find it? [The screen is seen shaking in negation] OK! [laughing] Yeey! Here we go! [Sits next to Hm? Oh. Sure dad. OK. You seem kind of dump trucks. What? You know, "in the dumps." Oh, sorry. It's cool. I'm just thinking about the future, I guess. We're on, like, the bleeding edge of history. Everything ahead of us is totally unknown and there's no guarantee that things are going to be all right. It's exciting, but it's also pretty scary. You know? [Looking weirdly at Ooooh! Guys, I don't— No, no, no. Leave it up to your daddy and uncle Finn! [Kisses OK, you guys have fun! I'm gonna get some more juice. [Walks toward a table] Mom has some weird taste in men. [Cleans table using her hair, takes the juice box and puts some in her glass] [whispering] Pssst. She's going back! [Driving a fake bike he made shape-shifting] Ding-ding! [Stops] Scre-e-e-ech! [Walks up to a fake door he made shape-shifting and presses the ring after which a farting sound is heard] [Dressed up as a lady, [exclaims] You just gotta sign for it, to prove you accepted delivery. [Hands out his clipboard-shaped hand] [Writing on the clipboard using a dust-cleaner] Ac-cept-tance. Guys, I'm basically thirty. I'm not a little kid anymore! [holding a night-light in form of Jake] You're not a little kid anymore! [screaming] WHY-Y-Y-Y!? Cinnamon Bun, you can't sleep with a night-light anymore. You're basically thirty—it's starting to bum everyone out. [screaming] I can't handle this denial of light!!! Yeah, well— [screaming] No-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o! [normal voice] Too dark. [Turns the lights on] No! It's too bright! [Pushes the lamb which breaks] Ah! It's too dark! [A fire starts] Oh. A-ha. OK. This is nice. [imitating siren] [Pour water inside of Cinnamon Bun's home] Ah! Too dark! [Goes to the window] [Waving his hand] Hey, Cinnabun! I—need—soft—light! [Throws himself out of the window] Yeeargh!! [Opens fridge] Yeeargh! How long has this been in here? I don't even remember buying this. Oh well—easy come, easy go. [Throws "Yeeargh!" in the trash can. Then, he gathers other products and throws them as well] Goodbye! Well, that wasn't so bad. [humming] [Pulls out a marker and a piece of paper out of his beard] Hm. [It's shown the paper is actually a to-do list with five check mark boxes] Ah! Nothing like a hard day's work to get them spirits a-lifted! [laughing] Great news, fellas! I finished all my chores, so we can start movie night early. Take your sits and will reveal the nominees. We got "Baby Ballet," "Blimby's "WHO GOTS DA ABC'S"," "Airplanes Taking Off," — [gasp] Oh, wait! What's this one? "Basic Mortality Season 1"!? Isn't this that show that everyone is talking about? I heard that this show is really good for penguins. Wow, that's really lucky for you guys, I'm a little jealous. Well anyway, good luck to all our nominees! OK, all in favor of "Blimby's "WHO GOTS DA ABC'S""—raise your hands. OK, all in favor of "Baby Ballet"—raise your hands. OK, all in favor of Air—What!? "Baby Ballet"? Come on! Ugh! I should have never given you penguins the right to vote. Well, you may have numbers on your side, but I still have one trick up my sleeve. Bargaining. Whereby, you let me watch "Basic Mortality," and I in return will do anything you want in the whole world. How 'bout it? Wenk. Algebraic! I know he was your partner. Enough! Alan is not the super-murderer! I don't know about this show though— This, captain, is the most lamentable super-murder I've ever seen—and I've seen plenty. —might be a touch too dark. [screaming loudly] Too dark! [Climbs on a small hill and falls down from it. He falls before a light made by a window near by a castle] [screaming loudly] Too bright! [A lemon falls on his head] [Peaking from a window] Eat on it! [Slams the window closed] [Inside the castle] Hm-m-m. [Inside the castle] Hm. Oh, little Lemon-Sweets, our son. [Takes the toy's hand and makes it wave] So precious. You enjoy sitting in your chair? [Takes the toy's head and makes it shake in agreement] What would you like to do now? [talking in a soft, squeaky voice] Go to bed. No, he wants to dance! [Takes the toy from his brother's hands and makes it dance] [hesitantly] Dearest brother, I really think Lemon-Sweets would rather go to bed. [Tries to grab the toy] [Puts the toy in its little bed] I'll fetch our son a sleeping bonnet. [Opens a lock filled with little hats and takes a little bonnet] Beautiful. [Turns around and sees Lemongrab making the toy dance] [gasps] [screaming] Brother, stop that!! [Shakes head in disagreement] [talking in a soft, squeaky voice] We hate you. [Hits his brother, causing the toy to fall and break] [screaming] O-O-Only O-O-O-ONE!!! [Grabs his brother and proceeds to swallow him whole] [screaming] The end! My end! My end... table, my love seat, yeah. Gee but it's great to be back home. It's always a blast visiting my cousin, city-Fox, at his future palace, but you just can't beat that old country steez. City-Fox's digs be mad sterile. Look a this. This was my grandpa's rug. Some bums let him have it 'cause it was so ugly. [He comes near a heating machine] [loudly] And check out these classic stylings. They don't make 'em like this anymore! [Nearly gets hit by hot water] Wow! Haha! Almost got me right in my both eyes! [Goes away from the heating machine] Look at my bugs. [Comes near two old, ugly, bugs talking about something] Man, I always did have the ugliest bugs. What are they doing? Selling each other houses? [Goes near the bed] Yes, siree, there's some things money can't buy. [Looks at a a sleeping-hole in the bed] You see that depression? You can't buy that, you gotta earn it. Boy, it's like I can almost see myself sleeping in there. [An imaginary figure of himself appears before his eyes in the sleeping-hole] [screaming] Wha—? [He sees himself standing up and going toward the table. His imaginary self starts writing something on a piece of paper] "Dear conscious self, I know where some buried treasure is. I'll draw you a map. Love, subconscious self." Oh my gosh, I'm gonna be rich! [laughing] [His sub-conscious self starts drawing a map] What the—? [Mr. Fox's sub-conscious self disappears] Oh, no! My riches! [Knocks hard on the door] [grunting] Let me in! [wild music plays] [Rips of light] It's too—bright! [gasp] Too dark! [Flips the bed and runs through the wall, breaking it] [screaming] Cinnamon Bun, you!  Did a great job, on this hole wall. It's very rustic. [gasps] M-m-m-m, what a jerk. What, a jerk? Yeah, just give it a little jerk. [Changes an engine's position inside a suitcase] [Closes the suitcase] Now that's a time machine. Hey, sweetie! Sweetie, look! Your time machine's all ready! Aw yeah, you havin' fun, dad? Aw, anything for my baby pup. OK. As long as you're having fun. [laughing] Time machine! [Presses a button, when suddenly the entire room gets covered in a red light] [screaming] [shouting in Korean] Ha-ha! There it is! You see? The birdhouse door—it's right above the peg thingy. Why didn't I think of that? [laughing] Well, I guess that's it for this week. I'll see you crimpy glimmers on the—what? What's that? You want to finish the grayble? [The screen is seen moving up and down, implying the viewer is shaking his head in confirmation] You want to see if you can still guess the theme? [The screen is seen left and right, implying the viewer is shaking his head in negation] You just want to see how it ends. [The screen is seen moving up and down, implying the viewer is shaking his head in confirmation] Well, let's get right to it, then. Ha-ha. Stranger! Stranger! Stranger! Stranger! Stranger! [Pointing toward Cinnamon Bun trying to take the night-light in form of Jake] [Putting his finger before his lips, telling BMO to hush] [Walks up to BMO and types "ITS OK," making BMO disarm the alarm] Excuse me. [Puts BMO down and turns toward Cinnamon Bun] HEY, why are you trying to steal my dad's stuff!?! Hey, I need a night-light because I'm so scared! Man, you can't steal, dummy. [Starts crying] Fine! [Uses hair to get the night-light and gives to Cinnamon Bun] Here. NOW GET LOST! [gasps] [laughing] Yes! Take that, Princess Bubblegum! [Leaves the Tree Fort] [Closes the door] Jake Jr., I'm sorry for messing up your time travel. Aw, that's OK. [pets Beemo, making it smile] It was just make-believe, anyways. O-ho-ho, was it? Then how do you explain tomorrow's newspaper? Who wants a cookie? [She moves it around, making airplane sounds.] Milk-dipped chocolate chip cookie? No thanks. Now, come on, Finn. You have to eat. Open Sesame... Uh, Jake, can't we get rid of these Clown Nurses? They make me feel ridiculous. No way, man. Well, now you know we can't jump off of birds. [The fat Clown Nurse waves a cookie around, mimicking airplane sounds and plops it into Time for our love therapy. Wait, what are they doing? [The Clown Nurse starts smooching [gasps] Oh my! Did that hurt, dear? NO!! I just don't want you kissing my toe! Now, now, honey, you gotta understand. This is the only way to "foo-foo" your boo-boo. What does that even mean?? I don't know... but I'm feeling better already. Ah. That tickles. You want me to stop? No, keep going. [The big Clown Nurse continues smooching [Beat] You're gross, man. [He notices a page in the Enchiridion.] Look! Deep in the forest of trees, there's a Cyclops whose magical tears can heal any wound. See? See? Maybe you should leave the medical decisions to the medical professionals, and my professional prescription is... your toe needs crazy smooches! It's the only way! [laughs] Huh? Wha? Wait! Wait! Wait! There's another way! There's my way! Let me show you my way! Ahh! Let me go! [The head Clown Nurse is still smooching It's the only way! [laughs] [softly] It's the only way! MY WAY!! Hmmm... Ring, ring! Look, there's only two choices, bro. Take your pick. There's the path on the left, Hair Fall-Out Path. No more hair again, ever! Or the path on the right, Smelly Path. Makes you smelly forever. Hoohoo, you won't believe it. Isn't there another way? Nope. But what if I just went— No, that's it! You have to choose! There's no other way! Choosing is the only way. Choosing—is the only—way. It's the only way! [laughs] Hey, listen man, the Smelly Path's not actually that bad! NO! I choose MY WAY!! [He kicks the sign off of her head.] My way. Ring ring. Hello, dummy police? Yes, there's a strange dummy lurking around my house. Okay, yes. Thank you. Goodbye. Wha...? [Beats] I need to cross the river. The Cyclops is over there. You can't cross this river. It's impossible! Look! The current is so fast, it'll turn your butt inside-out for real, doofus. And the water's so acidic it'll crump your boat in half. It's like orange juice. It's gross. There's a bridge, but it's a trap! Plus, the water's jamming with electric eels. Wow, so weird. Anyway, that's it, there's no other way around, you dummy. But I need to get across. Listen what I'm telling you. There's no way. ...Ugly tramp. Glob, Glob it, Glob it, Glob it... Huh? What are you saying? "Globbit, Globbit"? Who's Globbit? MY WAY!! Glibby glob, man! You're crazy! We're not even half way across! You gotta go back, man! It's the only way, you ugly fat-smelling fat-head! NO, MY WAY!! [Frustrated, [panting] MY WAY! [He quenches the acid by smashing one of the melons over his head.] Oh, Glob, oh, Glob, oh, Glob, oh, Glob. Uhh, excuse me, friend. [Finn blabbers his lips together.] You're pretty tall, can you reach up there and get my wheel for me? Gotta get these melons home to my wife. You know how it is. [panting] MY WAY! [He hurls the wagon down the hill. The wagon shatters as it hits the ground, and the melons tumble down the hill.] Watch out, Rainy! [gasps] Rainy! Whoops. Uh... man, I'm real sorry. Yeah? [sobs] No doy... friend. But... I can still help. I'll fix your house for you. Just get out of here! Leave us alone! Uh... wh... I... [sighs] Psycho fink. ♫ I was wrong. Was I wrong? No. Yes... Yes... I was wrong. How could it be? I trusted in my guts, but ended up all nuts. I was wrong. How could it be? Listened to my brain, but ended up insane. The melons rolled...over that lady. I went too far. How could it be? [ Hey! I know you're here for my magical tears, but you won't have any, because I never cry. I don't want 'em anymore. What? Stop lying. You're here for my tears, aren't you? No. I hurt a small, hairy man's wife. I just wanna go home. You're just trying to make me feel sad so you can steal my tears when I cry... but I've got a heart of stone, buddy. I'm EVIL! Dude! What's wrong with you? I said I don't want your tears! YOU'RE LYING! I'M NOT LYING!!! [Beat] You stink at lying. Fine. Whatever, man. Have it your way. Okay... I WILL HAVE IT MY WAY!! Huh? [The Cyclops pounds him into the ground.] Beg for mercy, or I'll kill you! [mutters] Whuh... What? [mutters] What? I can't hear you. I said... MY WAY!! Magical tear drops. [He pulls off the bandage. His foot has been healed completely. He wiggles his toes.] My way can still work! Yeah! Huh? I'm okay. Yay! Huh? [The bush takes root, and all his leaves regrow.] Whoa! Huh? Whoo-hoo. Yeah! Oh, yeah. Huh? Have you come crying back for your proper treatment, Babylips? Kiss that! Oh, my! You look horribly injured! My kisses will make heal you. [She smooches the Cyclops' eye.] Now how does that feel? Bittersweet. Hey, man. You want me to heal your toe with my magical goo? Ah, no thanks. I think the kisses work better. [To nurse] Excuse me, don't stop, keep going, please. [The big Clown Nurse resumes smooching You're gross. Hey! We all have our own ways. [realizing] You know what? You're... right. [sets table] Finn, lunch is ready! [holds nose] Ugh, what are you cooking? It's good! I learned it from Rainicorn. I'm not eatin' that. It smells funny. Dude, this took me, like— Let's go over to Tree Trunks's and get some apple pie! Apple pie! Apple Pie! Apple Pie! Apple Pie! Apple Pie! Let's go! [grabs Jake's arm] Whoa! [grabs a shrimp from his plate before he leaves] Eh. [knocking on door] Tree Trunks! [opens door and walks in with Jake] [gasps] [running over to her] Tree Trunks! Tree Trunks? [mumbling] Apples... my apples... Apples? You! [jumps at Jake] You took my apples! [starts hitting Jake] Whoa, whoa! [grabs Tree Trunks] Tree Trunks, it's us, Finn... and, and Jake? It's okay, Tree Trunks. We're here to help you. Just tell us what happened. [tearing up] They took 'em. They took all of 'em. All of what? Apples. My apples that I raised with love from, from mere seedlings. Without my special apples, I won't be able to bake any more apple pies. NOOOOOOOO! Don't you worry, Tree Trunks. We'll find those thieves and bring them to justice. Let me show you the crime scene. [leads them outside] You see, boys scads of apple trees but, but no apples. Hmm. Is anything else missing, Tree Trunks? No, Finn, they didn't touch my rocks, or my birds, or my flowers, or, or nothing. Hm. Well, I don't see any footprints. What'cha got, Jake? [patting the air] No ghost doodies. Oh. Oh, wait. [feeling something invisible] Oh, no. No. Hm. Tree Trunks, is there anyone you can think of who might want to crunk you up? Oh, no, Finn. I take great care to assure that-that I'm loved by even the most heinous cretins— Hey, guys, I found something! Look! Uh! Oh, heheh, hey, Finn. Heheh. Oh, hey, Raggedy Princess. Have you seen anything fishy going on? Um, no, heheh. I've been kinda down in this hole for a long time. [laughs nervously] I got knocked down here by some ne'er-do-wells. It was terrible. I was so scared. Ne'er-do-wells? They stole my apples. [flapping ears] I'm gonna sass those boys up nasty! [laughs] Awesome. Where do we find these guys? Oh, the Candy Tavern, man. I used to hang out there back when I used to snatch old ladies' purses. [jaw drops with "brring" sound effect] Don't worry, I stopped doing that a long time ago. I didn't know it was wrong. [jaw still hanging, with higher "brring" sound effect] Okay, you two, let's get going. Whoa! [gasps] Oh, my! Uh, does Princess Bubblegum know about this place? Be cool, man. You're gonna queer the deal. Oh, yeah. Try not to act suspicious, Tree Trunks. Okay, I won't. Where—? Oh. [motions for Tree Trunks to continue] Where's my dang apples? Oh, [laughs] Tree Trunks, you're so silly. But, but listen, you wouldn't happen to have seen any—I don't know—apples around, have you? "Seen any apples?" Y'all ask a lot of dumb-butt questions... almost like you're trying to solve somethin'. What? Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no. Mmm... clean, too. Almost like some [pounds bar] do-gooders! Hold on, we gotta go potty. Dang. They almost got us, but I think we blend in pretty well now. [licking toilet paper] This, this toilet paper's drying my mouth all up. Uh, Tree Trunks, don't eat that. [sighs] Here. [holds her up to the mirror] [whispers to Jake] You gotta watch her, man! Oh, I look just like an army brat! What can I do for you? [pouring drink onto bar] You know where a guy might maybe score some apples? [drops mug onto the floor, shattering it] Well, when you put it like that.... A couple of buddies I know have some apples for sale. I'll show you. Hey, fellas, these folks been askin' 'bout your... apples? [scratches chin] Okay, show 'em the apples, Smudge. Grab 'em! You go back, and you tell your boss to stop looking for those apples 'cause they're ours now! Wha-what boss? Your boss! Dr. J? We don't know any Dr. J. [punches Finn's forehead] Liars! Come on, Smudge [walks off] [mumbling] ...gonna take my apples. What just happened? I guess these guys who stole Tree Trunks' apples also stole Dr. J's apples, and they thought we were workin' for him! Finn? Finn. Hm? This could be dangerous, a-and if you want to go back home, I understand, but I need to do this. Yeah, Tree Trunks, me too. Hey, Finn. Hm? [pointing to mark] What's that on your face, buddy? Oh, that guy bopped me one. Must've had a ring on. Y'know, I think I seen that symbol somewhere before. Yeah, right next door to where I used to hawk stolen bikes. What?! I didn't know it was wrong. [points to a building with the mark] Yeah, you see? That guy must work here or somethin'. [knocks on the door] Hello? [through door] Who's the heck happening? What? Uh, we're here about the apples? Oh, okay. Let's see your ring. Um... Here. [forms a ring on his finger and shows it to Wormo] [opens door] Come on in. Follow this guy. [leads them in] [leading them downstairs] My boss is gonna be real psyched I found someone to buy his apples. A whole crate. [shows them a crate of diamonds] What the? What's wrong, guy? These aren't apples. Oh, ya didn't mean diamonds? All ne'er-do-wells call diamonds "apples." Like calling money "bread" or rock-knockers "butter-slaps." [opening door] Hey, Wormo, we're back—what the?! [points to Finn, Jake, and Tree Trunks] What are they doing here? They're here for the apples. That's the dang Dr. J gang, Wormo! Grab 'em! Um, sir? [laughs nervously] I promise if you let us go, we won't tell no one about your apples. Feed 'em to the pig. Yeah, the pig. Heheh, yeah, all right. [walks offscreen and returns carrying Mr. Pig] Uh, I'm sorry, y'all. They're makin' me do this. I-I'll try to make it quick. Hold it! Dr. J! [drops pig] Yeah, yeah, and I want my apples back. [in unison] Get 'em, boys! [starts sobbing] Aw, don't cry, Tree Trunks. But we're never gonna find those apples. Apples? You guys looking for apples? Uh, yeah, why? 'Cause I can hear a bunch of apples in this room. Wait, you mean "apples" as "diamonds"? No. "Apples" as "apples"? Yep. You mean apples that we eat? Yes. With all due respect, Mr. Pig, sir, my apples were stolen by a dirty, rotten criminal who needs to be put in jail. I'm just telling you the facts, ma'am. What I hear is a whole pigload of apples inside that closet. [points to wardrobe] They sound scared. Well, I hate to tell you this, boys, but there's no apples in this closet. [sticks tail into keyhole] You see, uh, I'm the only one who knows how to open this closet. [opens it] [gasp] Oh, so I was the apple thief after all. No, Tree Trunks, that's preposterous. No, Finn, I'm a criminal, [picks up phone and dials 911] and I need to pay the price. Banana Guard speaking. Uh, this is Tree Trunks, you don't need to do this. Thank you, Finn and Jake, but I won't let myself slip away from such a terrible crime. Goodbye. Tree Trunks. Ah, this is hard to watch. I'm gonna look away. This place could use a scarecrow. Huh? Wait, what'd you say? Uh, I-I said this place could use a scarecrow. A scarecrow, no footprints, all those magpies on the roof, Raggedy Princess in the ditch, and all the apples in Tree Trunks's closet. Boy, this place could use a scarecrow. That's it! [climbs onto Tree Trunks' house's roof] I knew it! The magpies have been stealing the apples and accidentally dropping them in this hole! And that's why there weren't any footprints around the tree! Yes. And the magpies were able to steal the apples because Raggedy Princess wasn't sitting on the fence post to scare them off! Does this mean I'm innocent? As innocent as a baby's butt cheek! [jumps off roof] [laughs] Awesome! This calls for a celebration! You know what that means, Tree Trunks! I'ma bake you the biggest and the tastiest apple pie you boys ever tasted. [strains and breaks the handcuffs] Whoa. [to Banana Guards] Uh, you boys better stick around if you want a bite of my apple pie. [slaps Banana Guard] She slapped my butt! [laughs] Cinnamon Bun, what the heck are you doing out in the woods?! I asked you twenty minutes ago to take these drinks around for us. Oh, oh, "around for us." I thought you said "walk to the zoo and back"! Gob. [smacks forehead] Finn, Cinnamon Bun's gonna attend your juice bar now. I have a special job for you. As Ooo's greatest champion, I'm relying on you to keep Lumpy Space Princess from crashing this wedding. I went ahead and deputized you. [hands a badge to Finn] So, you know, no holds barred, got it? [giggles] Yeah. Oh, what about Jake? Well, honestly I haven't seen Jake this happy in a while. I kinda don't want squash his groove. Knock, knock. Hey, Tree Trunks. Oh, hey, Princess. Wow, you look prettier than a sippy cup in a snowbank. [giggles and closes the door behind her] Thanks, Tree Trunks. Now listen, I don't want you to worry about a thing. I've got Finn on LSP Deputy, and we're keeping your ex-husbands, Randy, Danny and Wyatt, a hundred feet apart at all times - at least until it's time for me to perform the ceremony. Oh, well, uh, Princess, I appreciate your generosity going to all this trouble to hijack my wedding and all, but you can't perform the ceremony. What?! Why not? Uh, well, I'm sorry, but I just don't recognize your quote unquote "authority" on such matters. I can only be married by His Holiness, the One True King of Ooo. Now I know... That fraud is here?! Why, yes, but... Oh, dear. Mama, I'm afraid I've offended the Princess. Oh, nonsense, baby. She's probably jealous 'cause you're about to marry a handsome, fine, saucy man. Oh, but he is a saucy, fine bologna factory. Mmmhmm, tell you what I'd like to open up that hood, see how the bologna gets made! Mama, please! Please don't call him a saucy fine bologna factory! Bologna factory, bologna factory, bologna factory! Oh, my perfect day. What else could go wrong? Please, go on. Describe the next thought form. Um... I see, like, reddish-green blotches. Ah... Ahaha! [taps the relative with his wand] One year good luck. I've waited a long time for this King of Ooo, and now I'm gonna expose you in front of everyone for what you really are! Yay! [giggles] Hey, uh, barkeep, can I have another one of these ciders? Sure! [takes out the bottle of apple cider and tries to do a trick but has difficulty taking the cork out.] Hey, little robot. How ya doing? I am the best! I love weddings, I love flowers! I love LOVE! Hey, did you know I used to be married to Tree Trunks? No! Heh, yeah... it's just me and TT. We had some wild times back in the day. Did you know I once taught her to play tennis? No... Yep, tennis! I took her to one of those... uh... paddles... or whatever, you know! No. Yeah, she left me. She said I was stifling her spirit... I mean hehe... You know, what? Not enough tennis for ya? No. It's starting! The ceremony is starting! [snorts] [gasp] Oh no! I'm missing the love! [gets off her stool] No! Uh, please stay here! This is cathartic. You're a good listener. [sadly]Oh, okay... [sits down again] Psst, Sweetie, you look so nice. Shh... Sounds really sweet. Lumpy Space Princess? Is that you? Let me go to this party... It's not your party, LSP. [tries to find Lumpy Space Princess.] Poor Finn. Don't you know? [flies up from an old well. The wind blows the picnic mat off I'm just gonna look in this guy's blimp. [gets on the top of the ladder and turns the door knob] Make sure everything's in accordance... [breaks open the window with her shoe and opens the door] with the laws. Psst... sweetie, what are ya doing? Get out of my way, Finn. [pushes Finn] Oh my glob, you're touching my woman body! Okay, dear, now up you come. [whispers] Don't hurry this. [she slowly takes a step on the stage and King of Ooo lifts her up and brings her on stage.] There you go! Whoa, whoa, kids! Gotta finish the ceremony first. Keep the baby in the basket! Everyone at the party get ready! 'Cause here comes the hot bunch of grapes! Ahhhh... oh my gaaaah... We've gathered here on this beautiful day, under my life-giving sun, to celebrate the enjoinment of Mr. Pig and Tree Trunks, the little elephant. These two weird animals... I bet some cute weddings are happening over there. [sighs] BMO, you're so nice. Those flowers look really cold. I've had a hard life. People seem cute. They seem nice. And then when you can't stop crying because they beat you in tennis that one time, they call you a baby. Yeah, cute nice babies. BMO? Mm-hmm? BMO, would you move in with me? Do you, Mr Pig, take Tree Trunks to be your ever-wedded wife, forever following the teachings of me the true I do. Do you, Tree Trunks, do you promise to love Mr. Pig forever, and spend the next 5 years with me and my serenity compound, performing simple household repairs, [Mr. Pig puts the ring around Tree Trunk's paw] to have and to hold the in sickness and in health, in my gated mountain compound? I... Everybody get ready... [ as she crawls to the ceremony, still with Finn pulling her] to pay attention to me... I... do... oh [looks over to Finn and Lumpy Space Princess right behind the guests, struggling to get closer. The blimp is also getting closer to the stage] Everybody, hey! I'm here! Look at my bouq- [gets knocked by the blimp.] Ah... [pours the cider into Wyatt's glass.] My zep! Everybody! This wedding is a farce! A criminal farce! Hey, just what are you egging at here? I'll tell you what I'm egging at! I'm egging at this outdated wedding officiant license! Oh, is that what this is about? You must've found that in my back records! I have the up-to-date paperwork right here! Oh! What? Uh... Hey, wait, how did you get that? I could've swore it was locked in my zep. No... shhh... no... nope nope, stop talking, go to jail! [handcuffs King of Ooo] Yeah! Princess Bubblegum, you have gone too far. We stand together against your tyranny. Hey, everybody. Your prison may hold one of us, but it may not hold all of us. Oh, poor No, Mama. Well I guess this is it, sweetie. [telepathic signals enter her head] Oh, oh no, the elephant graveyard is calling me now. Okay, hold your horses, I'm coming! Wait, Tree Trunks. Look around everyone we care about is all here together. Finn, Uncle Donald, Banana Guard Number 1, Jake, Jake Junior, everybody. We can have the ceremony right here. Hey yeah! King of Ooo, will you do the honors? Are you crazy? That loopy bird is gonna string me up sideways. You can perform your own dang ceremony. Kingofooo.com! [escapes] Oh, dear. Oh, my gosh. Tree Trunks, did you hear? Huh? The King said you can perform your own dang ceremony! Yeah, that really stunk. But... But... the King's word is law. I can perform my own dang ceremony? Are you up to it, TT? I'll try. I guess it's time. A-are you ready? Oh. Okay, um... do you Mr Pig take me, I do. And do I, Mr Pig, take him to be your lawful wedded husband, I do. Then you... you may kiss the bride! Aww, geez, let them all go, Banana Guard Number 3. Uh... what? I just can't stay mad at something so cute. Did she just say let everyone go? Looks like we got the whole place to ourselves... if you know what I'm saying. Wait, d-don't you think there might be cameras down here? I hope so... Jake, so I just had this weird thought. Well, that's normal; people always have weird thoughts around campfires. Well, I don't know. Isn't is sort of strange that we keep pets? We kind of make them worship us. What?! Nah. [tosses stick into fire] No, seriously, think about it. We're their only source of food and water and, like, tummy rubs. They basically have to love us. [turns towards Finn] What's wrong with tummy rubs? Yeah, tummy rubs are pretty great. [sighing he points upward towards a bright pulsating light] That one star is so crazy, looks like it's vibrating. [ Alright buddy, [pulls his skin over himself] that's a little too much campfire. Time for bed. [extinguishes the fire with a large hand] Whoa... holy. [seems himself and Jake] Oh, dang. [he playfully flicks Jake's nose, but it simply phases through him.] [Laughs] Uh, okay. [He feels himself being pulled away and floating above the treeline] Man, this is screwy. Maybe it's the can of beans we had for dinner. [He floats towards a small square house] Looks- uh- homey. Wuh-oh! Whoa-Aah! [He tumbles mid-air into the wall and inside] Oh- right. [Mumbles in his sleep] Mmm, Boobafina, just pay me back when you can. Aww. Hello? [Sitting on a chair doing a sudoku puzzle] Oh! Hey, you can see me?! See you...? But if I didn't see you... Wait, what did you originally ask me? Oh, forget it, it's cool. Do you, want a drink or something? I think I only have water anyway. [Sees Finn floating upward through the ceiling]. Whoop, here I go! Bye! Oh, that was sort of rude. I hope he comes back. [Goes back to his puzzle] [Above and way from the Fox's house] That guy seemed lonely, not a lot of foxes up at this hour. [Floating higher] Guess you get a lot of work done though. Quittin' time! [She ejects the bouncing children outside] You don't have to go home but ya', oh, you know how it goes! [Bounces away] Bounce House Princess. [His body follows her up towards her home]. I didn't know B.H.P lived in a cave. [He floats inside. Bounce House Princess is at her vanity getting ready for the night] Hey, this place is pretty nice. [Slathers cream on her face] [Blushes] Whoa! [Brushing her hair] Forty-one, forty-two, forty-three, forty-four, forty-five. forty-six, four-seven, fourth-eight, forty-nine... fifty! [Finn is exasperated by this point]. Fifty-one, fifty-two [A noise startles her and she looks towards the front door]. Who's there?! [Loudly gasps] Oh my glob, oh my glob, oh my glob, oh my glob! [She runs to a far wall and rips the wallpaper, revealing a "Panic Room" door] [She quickly inputs the code] six four three two one! [She looks behind her to see the porcupine licking a cracker]. [Floats towards the panic room. He annoyingly looks at the porcupine] Dude, what's your deal? [The porcupine not hearing [Inside the room she nervously eats a jar of preserved 'Froot Salad' ] Everything's okay now. Aww, geez, poor Bounce House Princess. [Her expression changes to panic as she sees the porcupine making its way towards the panic room's closed door.] [Looks at the monitor] Wha? [Stops and toughens up] [Now floating above the princess's cave] Gosh, I hope BHP's okay, I feel bad for just splittin' like that. Maybe they sorted it out, they could have stuff in common. You never know until you speak to the person. [Floating around the clouds, he sees flashing lights and hears music] Oh, hey, Cloud Kingdom. [Floating above the party goers he spots the Ice King] What the? Ice King? [Creates a giant ice ball and breaks it into ice cubes. He is seen leaning against a wall speaking with a Cloud Woman named Lauren] Yeah, I guess there's some cool people here, musics a little loud but the but the punch is top-drawer. Mm hmm Hey, you should come to one of my parties sometime; I'm friends with some pretty cool people too you know? Uh huh, who are your friends? Oh, uh- like that guy, Finn. [Suddenly takes interest] Finn?! Yeah, Finn and I are pretty tight! [Watching the scene gasps at the idea and growls in frustration] Hmmm [Holding a cup] Oh, hi, are you the ice-dude? [Zaps her an ice cube] That's me, ice-dude. [Back to the other Cloud Woman]. Hey, have you ever seen the inside of an ice bear cave? Did you say you know Finn the Human? [Holding a cup] Hey, buddy, buddy! Care to freshen me up?! [Ice King zaps him an ice cube] Yeah, yeah, now scram. Hey, is Finn seeing anyone right now? Could you introduce us? [Gasp] Oh my glob! Is he here now?! [Looks around] So I guess you're more into the 'little brother-type'? Huh. [Holding a cup] Hey Lauren, I heard your grandpa's given out ice! [Chuckles] [Growls angrily] Ice?! I'll give you ice! [He unleashes his powers zapping the group of partiers, one passes through Finn who is unharmed] Oh, looks like I put this party- on ice. Oh wait, you want ice? You, oh, you got iced! [Turns back to Lauren who is now a block of ice] Anyway, oh, don't look at me like that Lauren. [He watches as he and the other Cloud People slip through the clouds and fall towards the grown]. Eh, this party was weak anyway. [Floating higher above the clouds] Poor Simon. Poor Simon, I guess? Poor Simon... sort-of? It's like some part of him wants to be a sad wong-lord. [Floating higher] But why would anyone want that? Is there some... incentive? [A strumming of a guitar is heard. Sheesh, I wonder if being a sad loner gives you more raw material to form song ideas. Is that where creativity comes from? From sad-biz? [Floating above the earth] I am so high up now. I am so high up, there is no "high up". It's all just... [looks up to see blue creatures circling in space] Whoa! What the--? Whoooa! [Floats in the middle of the circle] Space Lards! Ah man, Jake would be flipping out; trying to get that super-rare milk. Make a sick flan with that milk. Oh, well. Whoa! What's going on? You can't see me, right? [The Space Lards open up, their mouths and eyes begin to glow. They concentrate their beams into the center where [Gasp] I'm in the Mother Lard! [A newborn space lard exits its egg sac, greeting the human boy's astral form with a "Fiiiiinnnnnn", and phases outside the flesh walls of its mother]. What? Space birth! [A shot of the comet and Fire defense missiles! Missiles away! Impact with Catalyst Comet in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1! Yes! Do you think it worked, Star Man? [Shrugs] Uh, yeah, probably, right? [The comet appears through the missiles' dust cloud without getting so much as even a dent] Shoot! No effect! It's still coming right at us! Was that all of our missiles? Uh, yeah, I'm surprised we even had those ones. Like who would we shoot a missile at? Who'd we shoot at?! [Covers his mouth] Rooot! Grob. Assessment. We're sunk, bro. This whole place is gonna be a stinkin' molten dump in a minute. It doesn't make sense. Every 1,000 years, the Catalyst Comet mysteriously reincarnates itself and collides with Earth, bringing with it an agent of change. But the comet has never been so off schedule - and it's never freakin' hit Mars! What do you think, Finn the Human? Wha? Who, me? You can see me too? Yes, I am Glob. Oh yeah. Hey, do you ever say "Oh my Glob?" No, but sometimes Gob does. [They all smile and so does Finn, who laughs] You're dreaming so far from home, it must be comet related. Yeah, but, I gotta question. What's that? Well, if just being born is the greatest act of creation. [shot of Space Lards] Then what are you suppose to do after that? [shot of Mr. Fox looking at the sky] Isn't everything that comes next just sort of a disappointment? [shot of Ice King standing in an empty Cloud Kingdom] Slowly entropy-ing until we deflate into a pile of mush? [shot of Bounce House Princess, now deflated in her panic room with the porcupine continuing to eat] Well, it’s not enough to have created something amazing, right? What if I just let my Martian supersociety go to butt? But what's it worth if we're all gonna get blowed up right now? [Grob Gob Glob Grod suddenly takes off into space] [Wakes up] What is it, boyi?! ...Glob is dead. [On a walkie-talkie] Hello, Star Man, this is [On walkie-talkie] Yes! Gob Glob Grod Grob diverted the comet, it's back on its normal path to Earth. And what about the G-Man? No sign of Glob. [Takes off his hat and lowers it in respect] [The comet passes by] Ahh! Computer! What did we hit?! [No good - the computer spouts gibberish then explodes, no doubt from the heavy damage inflicted by Grob Gob Glob Grod's sacrifice.] Oh, blobs... [recovers and looks out the window] oh, for real blobs... [He is quickly approaching Earth] [to Jake] Hey, I think Bounce House Princess needs our help. [thumbs up] Let's do it!  Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Fire the laser cannon! Ah! Good job, girl! Have some spaghetti! [Muffled] Thanks! Ha! Too bad I'm a really strong guy and I took my doctor pills this morning! Lasers don't hurt me! Next time... Give us the Enchiridion! Ooh ooh ooh! [Imitates monkey sounds, and throws them the book] [Pleasantly surprised] Thanks... That's not a book! It's a bomb! You've been acting like a real knucklehead, Doctor Prince. Go on, get out of here! And don't ever do wrong things again! ...You're right. I see your side of things. You saved the day mega-rad cool guy! What's your name? Oh, The Enchiridion! I want to be your best and closest friend. Let's have a best and closest friend lunch! It's mac'n'cheezles! Awww... what a good guy! Aww, what a sweetie! [crying tears of joy] I'm just so glad you guys are real... you're really, really real! I wanna remember this day forever! Don't be sad, Ice King! We're going on a space adventure! Hop on, baby! Weehee hee! Here we gooo!!!! Ice King, stop, please. This story is terrible! Hm? Wha—? ...I don't even understand... Maybe this story is a new form of torture! Oh, come on! It's a first draft... don't hate! And besides, that story had everything. Action, adventure, a hotter, older guy... Wildberry, don't pretend; I know you like the silver foxes. What if it were a... little more like real life? Real? It's based on the real Fionna and Cake! Yeah... but what if there was a little more romance in the story? Romance is a great idea! Y'all are just hatin' on my steeze! I'm not listening to haters. Haters! What the... Whoa... I'm sorry I didn't think you were real, Gob... but now I've seen your power, and I've got some things that I did that I have to say sorry for. Boo. [shocked] Marceline, how long have you been in here? Mmm... couple hours. [sits on the Ice King's throne] Oh, so you heard my story, then... Awesome, right? It's... good... but, maybe it's time to let someone else try. [She points to herself as Ice King seems unhappy and frustrated.] Listen up, y'all! I've got a story of my own! Hyah! Hyah! Ooh, nice throw! Thanks! I've got to do something today. What about Gumball's mission we went on this morning? Delivering daisy chains to the fluffy people not enough for you? Uh... sometimes Gumball's missions can be so... lame. Hello, every— Oh my! Looks like you almost skronked up my dome piece! [He licks he finger then puts it on his 'dome piece' to fix it.] Boy, have I got a treat for you two! The fluffy people and I baked these in appreciation for the mission you completed. They're cream puffs... try one. Uh... I'd love to, but... maybe later... What was that? Aww... Something's on the roof! Come on! I'm not going out there! It's wet. It is wet... [frustrated] Mhnn... Oh... it's just him. Oh, hey Fionna. Marshall Lee! Ahem! [sarcastically] Oh, forgive me! Hello, your majesty! Fionna, take me back inside. What? Is he kidding? Oh, honestly! I'm going in. Come and join me when you want more polite company. [He gets the umbrella and goes back down.] Be careful! Whoa! You got it! What a wad. [Blushing] A... a gumwad? [gasps] Fionna! [chuckles] Let's ditch him! Uh... [Turning into a giant bat] Lumpy Space Prince is throwing a party in the woods! It's gonna be freaky nasty! Umm... I know you're gonna say yes to me, so... Let's just go. Oh, yeah! Mmmm! This looks fun... bunch. Come on. You guys! Marshall Lee's gonna play a song, you guys! Follow my lead. Hey! [playfully pushes Marshall] ♫ Good little girl. Always picking a fight with me, you know that I'm bad... But you're spending the night with me... What do you want from my world? You're a good little girl. ♫ ♫ Bad little boy. ♫ ♫ That's what you're acting like, I really don't buy... that you're that kind of guy... and if you are, why do you want to hang out with me? ♫ [Talk-singing]  ♫ Don't you know I'm a villain? Every night I'm out killin', sending everyone runnin' like children. I know why you're mad at me. I've got demon eyes, and they're looking right through your anatomy... into your deepest fears. Baby, I'm not from here. I'm from the Nightosphere... To me, you're clear. Transparent. You got a thing for me, girl; it's apparent. ♫ ♫ Oh, oh! [Singing] I got a hot potata! [ You're not so bad, you know. Not so bad? I'm the son of a demon... and the Vampire King. It's not something I have to try at. You on the other hand... [Still singing] ♫ ... on the table... the table... for as long as I am able! ♫ I'm not trying to be bad... I'm hanging out with you because you're my friend. What? [holds up a cream puff] Like him? [blows the dust off of it into Fionna's face] [sputters as she waves the dust away] No... different! Hey! Yah! [Sarcastically] Oh no... [Laughs as he floats in the air] Hey, break it up, you too!! Out of my way, kitty. Hey! Oh, come on! That was funny! Cake! You okay? Yeah... Come on, let's get outta here. Hey! Come on... where you goin'? What's the deal? You're missing the party! Fionna, lighten up! Look, I don't care if you're being a jerk to me... but nobody messes with Cake. Oh, really? Well, what if I just take her right now, you know? What? Unexpected! MARSHALL! Cake! You want your Cake back? Come and get her! [Rapping] ♫ Did you think I was lying? I said I'm evil, without even trying! [Fionna starts fighting the skeletons.] Already dead, so I'm not scared of dying... Drinking the red from your heart in one sitting. You think you've got me pegged, you must be kidding. I raise the dead up, and they do my bidding. Girl, I'm a thousand years old, I'm a riddle... Bad little boy! Yes, I'm bad, but not little. ♫ Uh-uh boy, what are you thinking? Fionna! Cake! Grab onto my little paws! Marshall? Oh, this is bad, guys... This is really bad! Marshall! Come on! You gotta be okay! This is it for me, Fionna... so... why don't you just admit it...? You're in love with me... I-I get that you flirt with me all the time, and it's funny or whatever, but you're doing that now?! [ Faking it! Faking it! Okay, my shirt is, like, filled with cream puffs! Oh, goodness! Glob, Fionna... you're like the realest person I've ever met... [Fionna punches Marshall in the face] Ow, my cheek meat! Quit clowning, Fionna. F-Fionna? Fionna! The end. Oh hohoho! I loved that one! Oh, come on! You guys got mad at me for a bad story? I mean it's cute, but... that's not how'd they be! But look, it might not be too late to polish this piece off—let's spitball off some ideas. Like, if Marshall Lee gets sick and dies, but he's got a brother we didn't know about! His name's Marshall Lee...roy. Boom, shocker! [Rubs Marceline's leg] Uh-huh! I feel goosebumps! I like how it is! Yeah, don't change it! Yeah! It's good! [Quietly angry] Everyone get out... [Marceline and the Princesses leave the Ice king's castle. [exhales] Ladies and gentlemen, I have invented time travel. This phasical sphere is flooded with info waves that scan every second, logging every molecule that passes through its volume. [slips on the gloves and lifts the sphere] I made special gloves for it. [places the sphere around two small creatures] Now check it out! It's logging time. I'll set the clock back now. [swipes her glove] Now I'll push the time travel button. Eh... It's not really time travel, though. You just, you know, moved their stuff around. You didn't really manipulate time. Ice King's done it better before... with magic. Well, I enjoyed your presentation very much, Princess. Thank you for inviting me. No! For all intents and purposes, they traveled back to an earlier point in their time. Eh, I guess, but not really. I mean, Ice King did it for real. Guy pulled his fiancée out of time from a thousand years ago using magic. Hey, time, where's my fiancée? Am I right? [jingles bell] [laughs] Jake, don't deny my science. This is a time travel machine. Take me back to when my ex-boyfriend Brad still loved me! [stuffs herself in the sphere, screaming] LSP... Wha? LSP, that's not how it works. It can only rearrange your molecules into a previously logged formation, and you need these gloves. [quietly] Give them to me. No. You witch! Give them to me now! [pounds table] No, I'm sorry, but you need to pull yourself to— [jumps on her] You skunk! [tearing out Princess Bubblegum's hair] You skunk! You skunk! You pretty skunk! You don't know heartache with the whole Candy Kingdom in love with your pretty bubblegum buns! Glob! [pants] Hear me, Lumpy Space Princess, I will avoid declaring war on the entirety of Lumpy Space, ruled by your parents, if you apologize to me immediately. I'm sorry-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y... [floats toward the door] I'm sorry you're so [quietly] stupid. [slams door] Whoa! [laugh] Sheesh! Everyone in here is a loser. Nobody's as good as Brad. Oh, Brad! Why can't I get over you? Have you tried burning an effigy? That's what they do in movies. This isn't a movie, Charlie, it's real life! [sighs] Another cucumber water, Your Majesty? What? Oh, I—I'm sorry for staring, but, uh, I—I know you. We used to— Everyone knows me. I'm No, uh, from high school. W-we were lab partners. I'm Johnnie. Ugly Johnnie? Y-yeah, uh, you used to call me that quite a bit. Yeah, but I can't call you that anymore! Come on, sit up straight. Lemme see them eyes. Mm. Do it. Nope. Can't call you that anymore. [laughs and pounds the bar] So, what brings you to the Candy Kingdom, Johnnie? Business, uh, actually. I own my own company, bottling and distributing Lumpy gas. Mm-hmm. [moves her chair closer to his] And I'm up for a big contract, uh, here in the kingdom, which could really help my business "take off," so to speak. That's so cool. You're like your own boss or whatever. To be honest, I'm a little nervous about this meeting tomorrow. Why, Johnnie? I'm bad at talking to people. That's because you have poor posture. Really? You gotta stop slouching! Now look me in the eye! Yeah, stay like that. Boy, LSP, heh, you sure are making me feel good about myself. You feeling good makes me feel good, Johnnie. So... where are you staying while you're in town? I'm sub-letting a friend's apartment. Talk is cheap, Johnnie. You should take me there. That chair—oh, it used to be over there, but I moved it. Johnnie, it's so nice. You've really made it your own. Thanks. Ooh, records! [goes through the records and pulls out one with a face] Okay, wanna see something funny? Yeah. Okay. Okay. [laughs] Sit down! Okay, are you ready? Heh-heh, yeah! [laughs] Okay! [puts record over her face] [laughs] It's his face, but on your body! I know! That's the joke. My friend Melissa and I came up with that. You're smart that you get it. Boy, when this evening started, I was feeling so dump trucks, but now it's like a hundred forklifts! I feel the same way, Johnnie. Do you feel this couch? [laughs nervously] What? 'Cause it's where you're gonna sleep! Seriously. It's getting late, and I don't want you walking home. So I insist. I'll be in the other room, sleeping peacefully... and dreaming about you. [embarrassed] Johnnie... Thank you... for everything. [kisses her hand] Johnnie... go to bed already. You have a big day tomorrow. Good night! [turns off light and closes door] Rise and shine! I hope you like pancakes 'cause I got— [sees empty couch] oh. [sadly] I guess she'll be the one who got away. [turns and sees Lumpy Space Princess in the kitchen] Looking for someone? You're still here! 'Course I am! Now make me some breakfast! [drums table] Okay, Johnnie, good luck at your meeting. And remember, I'll be right over there, [points to couch] sending you good vibes while you're wowing Princess Bubblegum. Yo, why are you so confident, man? Aren't you nervous to meet the princess? Nope! My GF is back at my place sending me good vibes. Johnnie's friend has so many movie channels. Ha-ha, that movie was so dumb. [looks at nonexistent watch] Oh, poop! Johnnie's meeting! I wonder how it went. Johnnie! Oh, Johnnie, you're home! How'd it go? Oh, don't keep me in suspense, Johnnie! I did it, babe! I landed the sale! Johnnie, that's wonderful! And I couldn't have done it without you. I know! And here's the best part! She wants me back at the castle tonight to go over the contracts during a royal dinner. Oh, my Glob! It's gonna be so nice to have dinner inside the castle. It's been a while. Oh. No. It's a business meeting, not social. Just me and the princess, I'm afraid. What?! [storms out] LSP? So... Bubblegum thinks she can horn in on my territory? Sip from my soup after I cut all the onions? [floats by a mudscamp] Yo, think again, tranch. Who—who are you talking to? So how are you enjoying your time in the Candy Kingdom? Oh, it's just great. I met this amazing purple girl at the Candy Tavern. That's wonderful, Johnnie. Now tell me more about gas... [watching from outside] Oh, Johnnie... Ugly Johnnie, through my tender love you have metamorphed into Beautiful Johnnie Butterfly. [sighs] Every relationship, I gamble with my heart. I go all in because the payoff is true love. I see you when I close my eyes, and thinking of you makes my mind feel light. All my problems fade away, and I can't help smiling. Heh. To let someone you love go into the arms of another takes a big person. I don't know... if I can be that big. [lights Molotov cocktail and throws it through a window] Rah! [pulls wires from beneath a truck, causing it to roll] Eh, ehh. [gasps] We're under attack! [runs out] Can I help? No. Hide yourself beneath the tablecloth. There's cyanide-laced gum under the table. Chew it if you hear raiders break down the door. [closes door] Okay. [hides under table] [lifts up tablecloth] Hi, Johnnie. [gasps] What are you doing here? I'm going to time-travel you back to when we first met at the tavern—back to when you loved me—so we can have a second chance. What? Uh! [does the same to Johnnie's body] [laughs] Manfried, where are the Banana Guards? Take a chill pill, Princess. I handled it. What did you handle? You know. Someone drove their car in the door, but no one was driving, and it exploded, so I handled it. Mmm. [runs back to the dining room and kicks down the door] Don't chew it! Don't chew it! Don't chew it! [flips table, finding the time travel machine] Johnnie? C'mon. Sit up straight. Let me see them eyes. Ha-ha. Uh. He's not here. [gasps] What? But I sent him back. The sphere would have had to log his molecules before you engaged the time travel function. Well, then where is he? I don't know. [crying] Then if he's gone, can you send me back...? To before I met him so I won't have to remember this heartache?! If that's what you want. Do it. Do it! You witch! Give them to—huh, wha? What? Where are we? You asked me to use this. Don't touch me! [floats away] You pretty skunk! You don't know heartache with the whole Candy Kingdom in love with your bubblegum buns...! [floats out the window] [sighs] [sits down and pours herself a drink] Hello? BMO? BMO? BMO, are you okay? What did you do? It wasn't me. I didn't do noth- do noth- do nothing. [ Come on BMO. We got to get you to the hospital or whatevs. No, no. I am fine. Really. [ The MO Factory? Yeah. I am programmed with emergency instructions to get there. Come on! There's no- no- no- no- no time to lo- lo- lo- lo- lose. Okay. Now straight down this place. Okay, now take a right- right- right- right- left up here. The instructions also say that damaged MOs get a full memory-wipe before repairs. Don't let on what happened... or all the years we've been spent together will vanish like tears in the oven! Tears in the oven? [gloomy sounds] But memories are real, real cruc'[ial]! Yeah, no fooling. Oh wait, there's more! It says here only MOs are allowed in the factory. Wait what? Oh, that's just great. Hey, hey. Don't worry buddy. We're Finn and [laughs] Wow! Hey BMO, check this out, too! [ Finn, you're dumb- you're dumb- you're dumb- you're da man! This is gonna be a snap! Hello, there. Greetings, and welcome to MO Co. I'm Hey there, DMO. I am JMO. And I'm FMO! Greetings, JMO. FMO, you look ridiculous. Are you damaged? Are you in need of repair? Yes, absolutely. Thanks, DMO. I busted my core system drivers, and now I need new ones. Fantastic. Okay. Please get ready for your total personality wipe. Oh, right, right. Uh, right. I mean, no. I'm just here for the... nostalgic purposes. Ah, yes. 47.3% of MOs eventually return to the factory for assorted sentimental biz. Please step 100% on the ultra-tram for your complimentary tour. Greetings. [He starts the tram.] Wup! We are now passing over the famous factory floor. Birthplace of each and every MO. Behold the gleaming machinery! Teeming and wild with the throes of real creation. From this unlikely chaos emerges every shiny new MO. But nothing's moving down there. It's all shut down. What happened to this place? I'm sorry. I'm just a tram MO. I'm not programmed to understand that question. Also, you're just a JMO. You're not programmed to ask that question. Uh, what question? That question- [grunts with frustration] I'm serious... Anyway, MO Co. was founded over 1,000 years ago. By Moseph Mastro Giovanni. A sad and gentle man. Beloved by only those he built to belove him. On your left, you'll see the core system driver installation port bay. [gasps] Finn! Finn! That's it! That's where the driver ports are! I know, I heard! What?! Are you crazy?! Get back here! Hurry, Finn. I think he's calling the police or somethin'! None of these ports fit right! E, D, C, where's the B port?! Intruder spotted! Prepare to vaporize! Vaporize! Cease fire! No intruder spotted. Vaporization complete. Um, but what if they slipped past us, sir? In all the smoke? Allllright, everyone. About face. [All four SMOs turn around.] Does anyone see the intruders now? [The other three SMOs look around as the first SMO looks annoyed.] Like I said, vaporization complete. Now let's head back to base. It's donut o' clock. Man, how about those goofs? Tryin' to mess with our drivers? Yeah. You know the world these days. All goofs. [ Hey! You toss me one of them 'nuts? [SMO 4 tosses him a donut while SMO 3 pours coffee on his screen, as if to drink it.] Ah. Yeah, hey, speaking of goofs? Haven't seen SMO 5681 lately. [while rubbing a coffee mug on his side] Man, that goof. Yeah, I hate that goof. [ Yeah, 100%. Oh! Hey, what are you doing over there by yourself? Uh, oh, I-- I'm sad. Oh, yeah, y'know we've all been there. [to the other SMOs] So anyway, how's your goofy wife doin'? [whispering] BMO, how are you doing? Get me close to that guy's port. I can hack into his computer and find out where my driver port is! [ Ah, we gotta hustle! [in response to something someone else said] Yeah, pretty good, I guess. I prefer something yeastier. The wife is always giving me grief about that. But I mean, what am I, decent? Hey, what are you two goofs doin'? Goofing? Dang, man, how deep does this place go? Down, right, left, down, corkscrew, down. [memorizing it] Down, right, left, down, corkscrew, down. Psych! [ Hey, woah! Down that grate! Hey! Only MOs are allowed in the facility 1,000%! [ Cram your tram! [ Hang in there, BMO! Hey, Jake! Can this thing go any fast- Woah! Shoot, it's the fuzz! Hit 'em again! Holy- Finn, how are we getting to BMO's driver port?! Uh, turn right! Dog it, they're still behind us! ["They drive through a 2D DNA-like path. Unlike a strand of DNA, there is only one looping part. Turn left! Turn Corkscrew! Now go down! There's a driver port! Too spicy. My bod! Non-MOs are forbidden in this facility! [weakly] I am not non-MO. [louder] I am [whispering, in awe] BMO. BMO? Did I hear BMO? Wait, what's up? Hey, I'm You're Moe?! Wait, are you human, too? My skin is human! Dude, how old are you?! Hey, come on, now! [ So...you made BMO? [ Huh? What? No...BMO's one of a kind. I built BMO to take care of my son. [A CMO brings over a screwdriver.] Oh, thank you. But I guess I never ended up dating any women. So, that's sad. [ Aw. Oh, there's that back-up driver disk! [A CMO is holding a small floppy disk.] Thank you. [The CMO gives him the OK sign and smiles.] [ Ooh! Are you my grandpoop? Nah, I'm just your poop. Wait, did you say you built a million robots? Yeah, all we saw was that tram jerk and all those jerky security jerks! Ah, those were just the surface jerks. [to MMO] Up, please. [MMO lifts him up over himself. He carries him over to a porthole in the ground with a wheel.] Kid, come over here. [He turns the wheel and the scene shows what's inside. There are a couple hundred MOs milling about. We see a QMO watering plants, an unknown MO with wings, two LMOs throwing dice and money, two CMOs playing jump rope with an OMO while a WMO, PMO, and three ♥MOs looking at them.] BMO, say hello to your family. Hello, family. Hi, BMO! Ugh. [pouring a bucket of liquid] Reduced to marking my camp with bear sweat. Those bears did not want to give up that sweat, [gets into sleeping bag] but it keeps the rodents from nibbling my lumps while I sleep. Ouch! I feel something crunchy! Like fried chicken! [pulls out a drumstick] Oh, it is fried chicken! [roars] Oh, my Glob—forest creature! I'd better eat it real fast! [gasps] Get back here! [chases after it] [breathing heavily] [tackles the raccoon] [shouting indistinctly] Aah! [falls in a mud puddle] What my life has become! Hello? Oh, my Glob! Oh, wonderful! [opens door] Welcome in, LSP. Uh, I want to go through— This place is so clean and nice! You're so kind. Do you have a sink?! Uh, there's one in the kitchen, and— I'll use the one in the kitchen! [bathing in the sink] [sighs] I need to tell you all the s— Get me a towel! Help me down! [helps LSP down] O-okay, I-I really do need to tell you how to care for Sweet P. Uh, there's a proper procedure for Sweet P's special tuck-in time. You have to be real sweet to him. Pat him gently on the head, kiss his cheeks... What? ...And give him treats. Sing to him real, real soft and sweet and touch your forehead to his and think the words, "You are more precious than anything in this world, and I will always, always love you." Then he'll fall asleep and have sweet dreams. Oh, my Glob, I'll do all that! Okay, bye! Have a wonderful time! [pushes them out the door] Time to get down to the chill-out! What a princess like me deserves. [turns around] Aah! Don't hurt me! I'm I didn't know you were huge. I'm hungry. Okay, let's check what's in the fridge. [opens refrigerator, takes out pizza] Do you like pizza? I like pizza. [grunts] [rolls pizza into Sweet P's bedroom] Get the pizza, Sweet P! [closes Sweet P's doors and pushes a table in front of them] Now I can kick back. [chuckles] [opens refrigerator] Refrigerators are just great! I never stopped to think how great they are. [sniffles] [shoves food in mouth] [munching loudly] [muffled] Now I'm cold, though. [goes in closet, pulls out a transparent gown] Oh, what?! [puts it on] I'm still cold. [blows on hands] [throws wood on fire] Rich-person indoor fire is just so great. [sniffles] I'm feeling all toasty! Must be time for toast! [puts bread in toaster] I'm waiting... Waiting... Waiting... All done! [eats toast] [crunching] It's not black and crunchy like when I throw bread into my campfire. This music's way better than owls' hoots. [dances over to window] I deserve this. [roars] No! You're an animal! You can't come inside! [closes drapes] [breathing heavily] [finishes eating pizza and knocks on his doors] I'm ready to be tucked in now. Hello? Will you be sweet to me? [walks over to window] Sweetness must be out there in the night to guide my sleepy boat right. [breaks through wall and runs off, feet pounding] Yo! Hey, Marcy! LSPita bread, what's up? [pulls a worm out of her bellybutton] Just chillin' in my awesome bubble bath! Did you break into someone's house again? Ugh! I have a new life now and a career. I didn't know you had any skills. Success isn't about skills. It's about being cool. These people just randomly approached me, like, "Hey, we will totally pay you to hang out in our sick mansion and feed our baby" or whatever. Well, good for you, dude. I mean, I feel like a totally new person now that I'm finally getting what I deserve. Oh, my Glob, what is that?! [roaring] Aah! [drops phone in water] LSP? Mm. [roars] [stands on toilet seat] [breathes heavily] [grabs shampoo] Take this, you dandruff! [squirts shampoo at raccoon, knocking it back into the toilet] [laughs] LSP. Huh? You don't belong here in the world of decent people. You belong in the woods with... [emerges from toilet] garbage animals! Noooooooo! Will you be sweet to me? Will you kiss my cheeks? [asking hobo] Will you give me treats? [munches] Blech! [spits it out] Will you be sweet to me? Wee-Ooo! Wee-Ooo! Wee-Ooo! Wee-Ooo! [screaming] [growling] Agh! [trips over table and breaks dishes] [moans] [shouting indistinctly] [knocks over picture] Look what you've done, LSP. Huh? You made it gross. Everything you touch turns gross! Uh... Just like you! Aah! [eating a jar of strawberry jam] You don't really think you deserved any of this, do you? You're a rat, just a giant rat that wandered into somebody's nice house. I'm a good person! I take care of babies! [flips table in front of Sweet P's room] Look! Baby Sweet P? [approaches hole in wall] [echoing] Baby Sweet P! Oh, my Glob, I lost the baby! I lost the baby! [crying] I'm a bad person! [chuckles evilly] Just accept that you're garbage! Hi-yah! [throws lamp at raccoon] Baby Sweet P! [leaves house] Have you seen a big, fat child around here?! [approaches Old Lady] Have you seen my enormous baby?! [crying] If only I'd cooked the pizza! [both munching donuts] I could've eaten some, too! I'm so stupid! [approaches Banana Guards] You got to help me! I lost some old couple's baby 'cause I didn't do the sweet things! I just wanted a bubble bath, and... How did I lose something so bi-i-i-i-g?! [sputtering] Ma'am, you're gonna have to come with us. Baby Sweet P! [slaps donut to the ground] Give me that donut! [jumps on donut] No! I'm not a bad person! I'm not a bad person! [crying] Huh? [crying continues] Hey, big baby! [crying] I found you! [whimpers] LSP! Sweet P! I'm so sorry! I should've been sweet to you! Here, okay, um... Pat very gently on the head... Kiss on both cheeks... Mwah! Mwah! Treat. [places donut in Sweet P's mouth] Mmm! [munching] Uh, and sing something sweet. [inhales deeply] ♪ Butter cakes, cupcakes, and ice cream cakes small baby bums and the friendship of puppies ♪ [thinking] You are more precious than anything in this world, and I will always, always love you. Aww! We're ho-o-me! Shh! He's asleep. Why is Sweet P's blanket on the wall—? Shh! [closes door] Mr. and Mrs. Pig Trunks, I have some good news. Sweet P has grown so attached to me that it would be cruel for me to leave him, obviously. So... Yes, I will accept the position as your live-in nanny! [sighs] [croaking] Huh? Partake of the chicken. [munching] Chicken... [munching] [crying] This is good chicken! [to Mr. Pig] Maybe we can get, uh, Neptr to sit. I don't know. Mama? I had that dream again—the one where I'm a comet boy. Oh, really? Yeah, coming back to Ooo over and over, and there was a fake comet, a beard man in a spaceship. My, what an imagination... The comet... approacheth. Hey, what kind of coffee do you want? Hazelnut! Hazelnut! What if your name was "Zelnut"? And then I would be all like "Hey, Zelnut." That's terrible. Hey, Zelnut. Nooooo! Stop! You hear that? Yeah. Susan Strong!? Finn, help Of course I will. Excuse us for a moment, Strong. [ What? Naw. She's crazy, man. She's a fish person! We don't know that! Dude, she tried to eat Peppermint Butler! She'd probably be worse if she was so scared of everything. Whatever, look, she needs my help... and I'm gonna help her whether you're coming with me or not. Oh, I'm coming with you if only to be disruptive and obnoxious! Susan, what can we do? I need your hero heart and your magic. My magic? [Points to fire boiling the water] Magic of red flower. [Scoffs] Fish people. Long ago, my people live in Beautopia... but driven out by Lub Glubs. We come here. We too scared to fight back. This why we need your hero heart. Hyoomans! [Hyoomans gasp.] I'll be back! Fish People! I'll be, um, a dolphin! [Turns his head into a dolphin shape; Hyoomen gasp and Come on. We swim there. No, you don't understand. I'm not a fish person. I'm human. [Thinking he said "hyooman," she laughs] We go. Grrr...[Susan squashes him down out of the way.] What? Hey, hey. What? [Examining Finn's head] You no gills. [Finn puts his hat back on.] We take boat. Oooh... I'm on a boat with a couple of wackos. Shakin' my hips, and dippin' my fat toe... In the water! Dippin' in the water! This party's gettin' hotter! It's so hot... it's stupid. So where we headed, Susan? There. [Points to a raging whirlpool] Oh, no. Oh, no. No, no, no! No, Susan, no! [Laughs] That was awesome. See, Jake? We can trust Susan. She's on the trolley. Keeps looking for Lub Glubs. [Whispering] No move! Whew, we safe now. [Leaves to steer the boat; Jake looks at Finn.] [Irritated] What? Dude, she's crazy. She's not crazy! She's cool! Whatever, man. This is a crazy cruise, and Susan is our crazy captain... and I'm a crazy clam-shell! Woo-ep! [Morphs his head into a clam and starts dancing] Oh, doing the clam! [Laughs] Quit acting like a clam, you ham. Hey, you hearing that too? Getting close to the Lub Glubs' mash-'em-ups. [Closes clam head] Huh? Behold! Balzacs! The clashing gates! [Rubbing Jake's head] 'S okay. Uh-huh. Finn, let's get outta here. Come on. She knows this place. Trust. We're ready when you are, Susan. You know, I could just stretch us over this thing. Go... now! Oh, good. Still got some boat left. She's flippin' crazy! Come on, Finn. Let's bail. Chill out. Alright, Susan, what do we do next? Hmm... never made this far before. Just gotta get past Lub Glubs. Yeah, what are Lub Glubs, exactly? They... umm, look, they like this. [Draws an obscure picture with her finger on the boat wood] Hmm. That looks like... my father. ...Now I'm crazy! Yes. Lub Glubs crazy scary. Hyoomans scared so long. Even [Weakly] Thank... you... [Stops paddling] [Excited] We here? We at B-Beautopia! [ Oh, thank Glob. Whoa... Ominous. We's be alls good once bring red flower to city heart. What's making all that swishing? Lub Glubs! They coming! [Laughs] It's just more pool floaties! [Panicking] Shh! Shh! Too many Lub Glubs to fight! Susan! Susan, Lub glubs are just pool toys! [Turns his hand into a pickaxe] Watch, I'm putting an end to all this craziness, with my Pickaxe Hand! [ Ooooh... Bad news, dude. There's only two of us and more than, um, [Looks at his hand and holds out all his fingers] this many of them! We gotta use the fire, like Susan said. Are you okay with that? Yes! I'm okay with that! I'll do whatever Susan says! [ Susan! We need you! [Piledrives a Lub Glub] [Whimpers] Yeah, Susan! Susan! [Tosses the lantern] Finn! Jake! [Catches it] I gots it! Red flower! Throw it to city heart! Finn, win aide to fair Susan! Humans and "Hyoomans" got to stick together! Huh? [Looking at Finn] Hmm. [Grunting] Almost... there... [At the top there is a furnace with straw that says "Light Fire Here."] Oh, so I just toss it in here? Pretty straightforward. Okay, well, here I go. [Swinging the lantern] one, two, three... [The giant Lub Glub grabs his arm and roars] [In a trance] That reminds me of... my mother. [ It's working, Susan! [Jake comes down.] Jake. Whoa. It is beautiful. You were right, Susan. This place is great. Well, we'd better get home. Finn, you stay. No, I can't. I'm not like you. Susan... [On the boat with pretzels] C'mon, Finn, let's go! I grabbed, like, 100 soft pretzels! [tiredly] What's shakin'? I-I don't know. I think I'm still asleep What if I'm still asleep? Then we're sharin' the same dream, dude. [points] Look out your window! Aah! Dream monster! Quick, let's go enjoy this dream before we wake up! [holding hands and dancing in a circle] ♫ Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream...♪ Whoaaaaa! ... [continues singing] Dreamy, dream, dream... [stretches back to Finn] Hey, man, I don't think this is a dream. Hmm? [looks up at monster] Oh, well, then it's time to get real. [takes out Root Sword] Help! Somebody help! Help! Help me! Help me! The monster ate somebody! We have to go inside its guts! [digusted] Ughhhh, monster guts. [stepping in something squishy] Bleh. Help! Somebody help! Hyup! [jumps toward voice and slides down a wet slope] [sliding behind him] Eeeeeeee! Ohhhhh. It's gross! [laughs] Help! [running to bear] C'mon! Help! Help me... hang these streamers! [takes out streamers] What?! It's not a party without streamers! ♫ Doot-doot-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo ♪ Dude, this isn't a party! We gotta get you outta here! Jake, help me! It's starting! [running to fireworks] Hehehehehehe! These crazy bears don't know they're in danger! Well... we should go. Jake, wait. We have to help them. They're partying! They're fine. [sighs] Okay, Jake, what happens when you eat food? Well, it goes into your stomach... Yeah...? ...and then it stays there for a bit, and then it turns into—[gasps] They're all gonna turn into... the stuff! [walks up to a bear] [talking over loud music] Hey, excuse me! Excuse me! I don't know how you don't know this, but y'all are partyin' in a monster's stomach! Thanks! I love dancing! No! [using hand signals] Y'ALL... are PARTYIN'... in a MONSTER'S... STOMACH! [to another bear] I THINK HE WANTS TO KNOW WHERE THE BATHROOM IS! [points] IT'S OVER THERE! Hey... I'm Hi, Cubby. What's goin' on? I heard what you said... about this being a monster's belly? I've been telling everyone that for three days! Why won't they listen? 'Cause I'm just a kid! Cubby! Are you bothering these guys with your fantasy stories? No! I wasn't! I swear! I'm dancing, see? SEE?! [dances faster] Hmm... [dances away] Cubby, is there anything we can do to help? You could talk to Party Pat. Party Pat? He's our chief. If you can convince him to leave, all will follow. Can you take us to him? Sure. He sleeps on the monster's heart. It's like a blood waterbed. This is as far as I go. Party Pat is right around this corner. Bye, you guys! Bye, Cubby! Bye! Uhh... we're lookin' for Party Pat? Oh, uh... [walks up to him] Well, listen. I know you don't know us, sir, but we need to talk. [snaps his fingers and approaches them] It's pretty important, actually— [placing his finger over Finn's mouth] Shhh-sh-sh-sh-shhhh. You know who I am? You're Party Pat? [shakes his head] I'm the chief. Riiiight... right. You're the chief. [places his finger over both their mouths] Shhhh... before you talk to the chief, you must party with the chief. But—! It is the only way. Dude, we've been partyin' for hours. [panting] Yeah, he keeps drinking those honey-flavored energy drinks. How's your nausea? Full-blown. Hang in there, pal. [walks over to Party Pat] Hey, Party Pat. You're the chief, and I totes respect that... but what we have to tell you is really important. And you said if we partied, we could talk. But you haven't been partying. What?! You move to music, but that's not dancing. You chew pancakes, but you're not tasting. To truly party, one must leave behind the problems that are troubling [puts hands on forehead] and open one's [moves hands away, revealing a third eye] mind eye. [beat] I'm just kiddin'. You guys are party animals. [points to third eye] This is just a sticker! [peels it off] You can stay in our cave as long as you want. That's what I've been trying to tell you, man! This isn't a cave—y'all are partyin' in a monster's BELLY! [looks around] Oh, yeah. That makes sense. It's definitely the weirdest cave I've ever seen. Heh heh. So... you'll tell everyone to leave? Nah, we love it here. But you're all gonna die if you stay! [sighs] [picks up a microphone] Attention. Attention, everybody. Can I have your attention, please? [bears stop dancing] So... apparently we're not in a cave. We're in a... MONSTER'S BELLY! [shrugs, drops the microphone, and backs away] It's kinda peaceful. [sighs] All those bears... are gonna turn into the stuff. [puts his finger over Finn's mouth] Shh. Seriously? The only foreseeable threat might be all these trees being swallowed, but they're not hurtin' nothin'. Yeah, good thing he isn't swallowing some deadly volcano lava. That would kill them for sure. Whoaa. The monster is headed toward that volcano! Uh-huh. We gotta warn the bears! If we bum everyone out, maybe they'll listen to us. Oh, okay. Just follow my lead. You bears gotta get outta here or you're all gonna be melted by lava! Party Pat, do you know of another exit? Well, there's the dark and mysterious mine, but nobody uses it anymore. [to Jake] He must be talkin' about the butt intestines! C'mon, Jake, we gotta get outta here! [disgusted] Ehhhhh. One more bandage. Huzzah! The party bears are safe, Party Pat. Y'all can party out here now. No. To survive, my people need a phat party club to grind in. That monster's gut was totally excellent. You're sick, Party Pat. I'm gonna go watch TV. [walks off] Hmmm. [looks at monster] [rubbing his tongue] Ohh... Pat, he's not gonna let you back in his mouth. You scorched it all up with fireworks! Unless... Party Pat! [whispers in Party Pat's ear] Party... pancakes. [gasps] [walks to monster] Hear me, monster. My people and I wish to party inside you once more. Prithee take us upon thine gut and we shall party no more with fireworks but instead [takes out a laser] with gentle lasers! Hey, Jake. [runs after Jake] Wait up! Have you obtained the staff of Stranson Doughblow? Yes, Bella Noche. We procured the staff using the full extent of our wizardy ways. Then the time has come to reveal my true form, and when I materialize on this... [continues talking] [talking to himself quietly] Oh, this striz is going down, man. ...you will receive your end of the deal. The lost system of Antediluvian magick—the tightest of all wiz biz. So right and tight, I get restless leg syndrome about it. Look. [shaking his restless leg] And now, it will be yours. And mine! What the blood?! Ice King! Listen, dudes, all I want is to be in the club and plus up my magic. What's the problem? Your life is my problem. Too late, fools! Whoa! What the—? Stop that now, trash cones! Bella Noche must not cross into our world! Eh, why not, again? Aw, cram! Here we go! [gets up] Uhhhh... hey. Hey, I—I can't feel my magic! Me neither. What gives? Bella Noche is a being of pure anti-magic! Y'alls got played! Uh, hello? Oh, what a fool am I! [Bella Noche slaps him aside.] Aaaaaaaaaaah! [to Wizard Police] Go! Destroy! Throw your boots at it, or—I don't know! Huh? [starts walking out] Dang. Sorry, Ice King. [panting] [trips] This must be it, man. [looks at his reflection in a puddle] I've crossed into some super-insane zone where I feel like I'm just normal again. [takes off crown] Or maybe I'm just normal again. Hey, stop looking at yourself. You're ugly, bro. Get lost. This is my busking spot. [punches Ash off his magic carpet] Sorry, man. No time! Go, carpet! [flies to the Ice Kingdom and then into the The Past room] Whoa! [gets off] It's got to be here. Even in my prolonged state of insanity, my immutable essence must have known to—oh, yes. [puts on glasses] Hello. [pushes over a desk, revealing a secret entrance] Ah, my research. My jackie—jacket! [reading books' spines] Mutation, mutation, mind expa—aha! [takes a book off the shelf] "Mystic Rituals And Their Space Time Applications" by A-one, a-two, a-one, two, three, four. Wait! What? Why are you holding your bass up high like that? Mm-mm-mmm. (I don't know.) I get better finger action this way. But you look like a nerd. Move it back down. It's better. Move the bass down. A-move the bass a-down. Be reasonable. [annoyed] Yes? Marcy, it's me, Okay, Marcy? You got that? Marcy? A long, long time ago, Simon was my only friend. He was there when I needed help. [holding Hambo] All he ever wanted was to find Betty, and now I can help him. Simon? Wenk! [leads them to Simon] Wenk! Simon! Marceline! I thought I'd never see you again. I can hardly believe it myself. You're all grown up. Believe! She's like a million years old! One million years? How could it be?! He's just kidding. I'm only a thousand. And still looking good! Do you remember anything from when you were the Ice King? Nothing specific—just dreamlike impressions. Do you still have impressions from all the times we flipped your bricks? I have... bruises. [coughs] Excuse me. I—[coughs harder] Man, Simon. I'm fine. [coughs] You're dying! Well, yes, but only in increments. I've still got work to do. Finn and Jake, will you run my generator? Yeah, man. Cool. That's great! Keep pedaling! All we need now is the catalyst—an object from the past that has been lovingly tended to through the ages. [sighs] Goodbye, Hambo. [kisses it and hugs it one last time] Because of you, I can say goodbye to Betty and tell her I'm sorry for driving her away. Thank you, Marceline. [drops Hambo into the liquid] [panting] [shooting ice lightning skyward] Where's my Betty? Where's my princess?! Princess! Princess!! Simon, don't leave me like this. Betty? Betty. Betty! Simon? What is going on? I'm a thousand years in the future, love. I opened this portal so we could say goodbye. You're dumping me? No! It's just that everything changed after I put on that crown. I—I went crazy. You ran away. I—I never saw you again. But where would I go without you? I'll never know. I don't understand. You don't seem crazy now. I mean, in the future. The portal is closing. There's no time to explain. Just know that I love you, and I forgive you for leaving me. Simon, I know who I'm leaving you for! Who? [leaps through portal] You, dum-dum! [kisses Simon] Simon? [picks him up and places him on the magic carpet] What's wrong? Are you sick? No, I'm old. The crown was keeping me alive, but its magic was negated by the creature Bella Noche. Don't die, Simon. I just got here. Oh, I'm sorry, Betty. I know! I'll fix the crown, and then I'll figure out how to fix you! What? No. Guys, stop her. Uh... Hmm... Yeah, but... It kind of sounds like a good idea. Right, whoever you are. [takes crown from Gunter and walks back to Simon] I'm sorry. It's the only way. [pulls carpet out from under him] No! [gets on carpet] Okay, rug, take me to Bella Noche. Get on, Simon! I am getting on... the death bus. [flying alongside them] I've got you in my sights, Simon. [laughs] It's my time, Betty! I don't want to be the Ice King again. It's like living with eternal diaper butt. I can't do it! Not forever. Destroying Bella Noche and getting your power back will buy me time to find a loophole that'll undo your curse and your death. I can do it! You got to believe me, Simon. I... Get real, man. You're gonna be the Ice King till the sun blows up. This is your one chance. I made a mix tape for the ride "Summer Jams 3"! If I don't let her try, then what am I? What am us? What? Eh, fair enough. See you in a few. [disappears] This brioche won't stop growing. [shoots crossbow] Ron James, what took... [One of Bella Noche's tentacles slams the ground.] you? Yo, my lab got creamed! I had to dummy-rig an alchemical filter out of a dirty bidet and a vaporizer! But will the double-negative magic work? Heck yeah! [screams] Yeah! What the stink is that?! My lab conditions were not ideal. But you did not deliver! [shakes him] Peace, man! Aaah! We're here to help! Help how? We're toast, bro. [grunts] [falls off carpet] Simon! [sighs] Hey, don't scare me like that. Just hold my hand to your face. This will be my... last sensation. Don't be a wimp, Simon! Just give me a second! [gets on carpet and flies toward Bella Noche] You got about 15 seconds. How the—? Wait. Surprise! [punches, then kicks Bella Noche] Tranch. You lose, Simon. Sorry, man. [walks away and disappears] Uh, huh? This a party? Huh? Wizard City is saved! [laughs] [hugs Ice King] Whoa! Heh. Okay. Whoopee! So then, Ron James told me this girl I was with flew into Bella Noche and mysteriously defeated it for me! Wow! [laughs] Just my luck, right? Black out for a day and meet the woman of your dreams. I will get you! Hey, don't be jealous, Muscle Princess. She's gone—kablooey. Let's be realistic, right? We both know you're not my top pick. Oh, Grod! [roars] No! Aaah! Go home! You can go! Aah! [groans] Eww! The sea lard’s in my bed again. Gross. Dude. That’s like the 8th time. Why don’t you just get rid of it? I don’t know what’s gotten into it lately. It's gross as butts, man. We’re taking care of this right now. I can’t believe we never thought of this before. The pond is the perfect place for a sea lard. See ya larder! [perplexed] Huh. Is he, like, okay? Well, seeing as sea lards are saltwater fish, and the pond is a freshwater environment…[inhales sharply] ...no? He’s a stenohaline fish. Haven’t you guys ever heard of osmoregulation? Allow me to explain. [shrieks] Waaaa! Sorry Shelby. Gotta save the lard. [underwater] Thar! [underwater] Wa? [singing in harmony] ♫♪♪Smash the frogs, smash the frogs, making frog hot dogs, smash the frogs…..♫♪♪ [Looking around, amazed] Whoa! [Emerges from behind a structure] Finn and Jake! [to other water nymphs] Yo! Finn and Jake are here! ♫♪♪Smash the frog - [interrupted, face Finn and Jake holding rolling pins] Hi! So, this is where you guys live? Yeah! We’re the guardians of this grotto. You guys want to stay for lunch? We’re making hot dogs! [both, excited] Hot dogs?!?! [realizing] Oh, wait. We dropped our sea lard in the pond, and we’ve got to save it before it dies from the freshwater. He’s a stenohaline fish. You do know sea lards are mammals, right? [embarrassed] Uhh.. I definitely knew that. [To Jake, whispering] I’m gonna murder Shelby. Well, hey, you guys should stick around. I’m gonna go finish cooking. [both] And we gotta mash more frogs. I can’t believe I just believe Shelby ‘cause he’s a nerd. [agreeing] I know. It's in his tone. [ [yelling to the lard] Hey, get away from there! [scoldingly] Bad lard! Lard!! [hears Finn and Jake] Huh? [realizes, yelling] Don’t go near there! It’s too dangerous! [yelling] Got to save this dang lard! [yelling] Whatever you do, don’t touch the purple stuff! [yelling] WHOOAH! [perplexed] What did she say? Don’t touch the purple? [perplexed] What happened to the pond? And how ‘bout our treehouse? The house part’s a-gone! [perplexed] What the butt? I guess we went through some portal to the past or some biz. [perplexed] Was stuff the wrong color in the past? [scratching his chin] It's weird as carbs here. [looking around, yelling] The sea lard! [ [yelling] Lard! [giggling] Hello, friends! [calling] Lard! Lard! Lard! Lard! Lard! Lard, lard, lard, lard, lard [singing] ♫♪♪La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la laaaa!♫♪♪ You are crazy. You are so crazy! [looking around] Everything’s like, wonky here. It’s familiar, but weird. [smiling] I like it. I don’t know. It kind of makes me feel… naked. [ Gotcha! Finally, we can take you home! [perplexed] Huh? [singing "Flower Song"]♫♪♪A one-and a-two- I’d rather be anything but me, a leaf on a tree, a bug or a bee. I just want to see the sea, I want to be free from this body, this flower body.♫♪♪ [In awe] Please don’t change. You’re perfect just the way you are. Oh, I know! I just like to write sad songs. [understanding] Ohh! [they chuckle.] Wait. Hey, Jake, what were we just doing? [interrupting, singing] ♫♪♪Chasin’ the fish, Chasin’ the fish, and its getting away♫♪♪[ [Turns around, yelling] [waving] Bye! [To other leaves] You guys are writing this down, right? Why does the lard keep running away? We're trying to get it home. Yeah, this place ain't safe. [singing] ♫♪♪bum-bum-bum, little purple, you're a catch, I love your pretty purple sash. We're a perfect purple match, Welcome to my purple patch♫♪♪! I'm [waves] Hi, Purple. I'm Ginn and he's Fake. Hmm.. Thats not right. He's Ginn, and I'm... wait... I'ma call you Purple Face! You want to come play in my purple place? [echoes, warning] Don't touch the purple stuff! [To Finn] Weren't we supposed to not do something with the purple things? [confused] Hm? Oh, you want purple? Here, take some for the road! [sadly] Oh, dear, I've purpled you. [sadly] Why do I always do this? [casually] Later. [pleasantly] Heh! What a great gal. Yeah. [pleasantly] Purple! [confused] Wait- what were we just doing? We were.... We were.... Who are we? I don't know, man. [Playing in the purple] But I like these things. [Trying to remember.] Foon. I'm--- I'm Foon. [groaning] I'm.. [smiling obliviously] Fine. Huh? Ja-- Ja-- Jaaauump! Hello. Are you a lost dog? I am boy. Uh.. maybe? We are boy and dog. I'm petting the ground, boy. Looks like fun. And it smells like toast. Huh? Crying. Long nose. [exclaiming and posing] Investigate! [speaking to Bush Boots] Miss, your crying indicates you're in need of help. What? [sniffles] Yes. I've lost my rolling pin. Understood. What's your name, miss? I'm Hugs! [wiping tears] The hugs helped my crying, but it didn't help me find my rolling pin. Boy and dog will find your rolling pin. [looking around] Where did you last see it? It was rolling around here not too long ago. Oh, there it goes! Come back, you bad little rolling pin! Bush Boots, lets sneak up on it. [wrestling with the sea lard] Am-boosh! [happy] Oh, you caught it! Wonderful! [struggling] Come on, now. Just roll the dough. [sadly, upset] Oh, its getting away again! Ma'am, I think that rolling pin is sentient. [Agreeing] Yeah, I don't think it wants to be a rolling pin. Dog, we have to save that rolling pin from this sweet lady. [ [yelling] Rolling pin! We want to help! No more.. Slime. Rolling pin trail has gone cold. A bee. I see. A poem by me. Listen for a sound and look around. [confused] Hmm? It's a metaphor. A pink pond. Pink pond? Pretty! [Giggles] Hee hee! Hello, friends! The pond has a face and is talking to us. [in awe] Yeah. [inviting] Dive in. I don't feel comfortable diving into a face. Dog, lets go back for apricot pie. [excited] Yeah, pie! Gross! [exclaiming] Whoaaa, whoa, whoa, whoa! And then there was like, a PB puddle, a Marceline plant, and a little bee that looked like you, BMO! You know what? We didn't save the sea lard. The sea lard saved us. Yay, sea lard! [on windowsill] Wow, what an adventure. [Turns around] And there was even a purple lady kind of like you, Ice King! She even sounded just like you. She sounds magnificent! How'd you say you got there? We didn't. Beat it, creep. I'll figure it out. But Simon, if you go there, you'll lose you memories. What memories? I'm like a goldfish over here. [curious] In what way, exactly? Oh, hey Jake. [exclaiming] Where am I? Comfy, dude? I bet you ran away 'cause we didn't appreciate you and called you gross and stuff. But you're not gross. [ Man... let's go home. Nuts to that. I wanna find a mystery cave. [Sighs] But, Finn, I'm gettin' all cranky around my joke-hole. Ow! Oof! Ooh-la-la. Whuzzat? Mystery cave! C'mon, Jake! [Grunts while crawling through tiny entrance.] Oh, my glory... Dude, no!! Don't touch that thing! It's probably got some kind of sacred significance. Yeah. I want it for my sacred bathroom. Finn?! [The light dims down and Finn's face can be seen on the lamb; Finn has disappeared. Jake!! You see this crazy jazz?! We'll get through this, my bro. I swear, I'm gonna get you out of that lamb. Jake! C'mon quit messin' with me. [Jake doesn't notice anything. The top of Jake's head goes through [Going over rocks as he pulls himself out] Ow. Ow. [Hits the entrance] Ow. [He exits.] Wish I knew how to free you, bro. Me, too, bro. BMO, stop fake-farting. But Finn always loved Heh heh heh heh heh! Hmm... [Normal view] That's it! We'll do all Finn's favorite stuff 'til he comes out! BMO! Play Finn's favorite song! Okay! What? Nooo... [The Spirits begin laughing at Are you hearing this, buddy? Guys... I haven't liked this song since I was two. [Exasperated noise; Leaf Princess! [Normal view] Come to me, my arboreal beauty! Gotcha! [Scoffs] It's just a dumb old leaf, ya dumb old Ice King. [To Finn] I know, but it's mine. Wait! What?! Ice King! You can hear me? Yes... Why? Are you makin' fun of me or something? No, it's just no one else can see me or hear me talk. Ohhhh, yeah.... You're trapped in the Spirit Realm. I can see all things Spirit with my... Wizard Eyes! Man... Never thought I'd be happy to talk to you, Ice King. Can ya help me get free?? Oh, yeah, I know all the ins and outs. And I'd do anything for a friend like you. Wenk. Quiet, Gunter. Can'tya see I'm hanging with Finn? Wenk wenk. I know I say that a lot, but this time it's true! Anyways... Where do all these spirits come from? Oh, there are portals all over the universe. I have one in my basement! Every once in a while, a real cutie pie drifts through. Ooh! [Whispering] Oh, gosh, there she is. [To himself] Mm, oh, yeah... [Chuckles perversely] Sick. What? I swear I never touch 'em! I can't! [Wafting through Spirits] Can't touch this, can't touch this... [Puts his hand through Finn.] Can't touch this, either. [Laughs] Yep, I can't kill any of them. [Looks down at a Spirit which secretes a liquid then flies away.] [Grave voice] I hate them... Okay, alright! 'Nuff messin' around. Let's getcha free from the Spirit Plane. Cool. Sooo, the only way to get out of the Spirit World is to stick all these lousy things in the Spirit Hole down there. Then plug up the hole with that. And doing that will set me back to normal?? Mm-hmmmm, trust me! We are tur-bros! Turbo bros! Tur-bros. Turbo. ...Bros. [Suddenly smiling] So be it! Alright, Finn. This oughta free you from your body prison. Couple-a' rounds of Kompy's Kastle will jog your psychic schnaps. That's what I think. Co-op mode like we always do! Oh, yeah! C'mon, Finn, drop the drawbridge. Kompy's blood lust meter's goin' down. Lemme help ya there. [Pushes the second controller's button; the drawbridge on the screen goes down.] Whuzza!! You love Kompy! [Beat. I... did it. [Drops down, exhausted] I did it. I'm ready, Ice King. Make me normal now. Ohhh, that's not all of 'em. There's this other guy that watches me. He's... super creepy. [Cut to [Running back to the hole] Ew! Ew! Ew! [Throwing it in] Eeeewwww!! [He plugs the hole.] Yes! It's gone! So... now I can go back to normal. Uhhh, wait, though. ...What? There's this last guy you gotta get. He's pretty much the worst. He usually leaves these gross heads around, but I'm not seeing them anywhe— OH! [Panicking] THERE IT IS! THERE IT IS!! Wanwan. Wanwan. Wanwan. [Crying] Nooo... Wanwan! Wanwan! NO! DON'T COME NEAR ME!! Wanwan! What is that? It's from the dead one. He leaves these heads around everywhere. I can't even touch them, but it still creeps me out... Wanwan! Please get rid of him! What do I do? Follow the heads? [Panicking] USE THE HEADS!! Oh, snow, please! [Sighs] Alright, man, I'll get it. [Runs up to another head] Where's your daddy, huh? Is he hiding in there? Wanwan. You better get back in the Spirit Hole, dead one. [It secretes another head. [Running away] Wamwanwan. Oh, my what? The cave?? How the...??? ...Weird. That's weird, but whatevs, though. [Forces himself out of the hole, then plugs it.] Whatevs. Ice King! Ice Kiiiing! [To himself] Where'd you go, Simon? [ Ha ha, Finn! You fell right into for my brilliant plan [sic] that I formed out of the thin air like a true Magi! Not only did I get you to remove those horrible creatures from my castle, but now you're trapped, and only I can see you. So if you want friends, this is it, pal! [Laughs] [Nonchalantly, walking away] I'm gonna re-open the hole. NO, WAIT, MY PLAN FELL APART!! [Finn comes back.] My... new plan is that you don't open the hole, and I destroy the porcelain lamb which will bring you back to the material plane. Heh heh... heh. Jake. [Drops down.] AGH, BLUH! GIMME THAT LAMB! NO!! [Evades Ice King's attack] Finn's trapped in here!! That's why I have to smash it!! You donk! I will smash you!! WAAAH!! [Smashes Ice King's armor] Escaped! [Jake yanks [In shock] Whoooo?! AAH! They're touching me for real! EWW!! Great. Now we're both stuck in here. [Panicking] FINN, GIVE ME YOUR CLOTHES! [Jumps on Finn, and pulls on Finn's hat] STOP! WUUH! I need a buffer!! AAAH! [Is thrown off by Finn, who is hatless.] Ah, jeez, come on! [Puts on Finn's hat like a bra and lays down; he starts waving his hand] I'm sorry... I'm sorry, they were just touching me on the body... I'm sorry... [As he's talking, the patterns on the TV screen move back and forth.] Whoa, do that again. [Ice King more or less repeats what he just did, and the patterns to the same thing.] Your hand is affecting the TV! We must have some kinda subtle effect on the material plane! Cooool. Whaddaya think, Finn? Can we pull back the veil of static and reach into the source of all being? Behind this curtain of patterns... this random pattern generator... So clever... right here in every home, watching us from a one-sided mirror... [Finn stares blankly.] Heh heh heh, whoops! Just wizard-talkin' to myself! It's okay! But let's use our subtle influence to break the lamb! Yeah, a'ight. You mean like this? Yeah, man! Bwoooo! [They both create winds and produce noticeable effects on the material plane] It's workin', man! Combine the swirls! Okay! Wha-zah!! Whoa! Finn, is that you?! [In Spirit World] YES!! Finn! Finn! Finn! [The lamb falls and breaks. Ice King and Finn reappear.] Whooooaaaa... [Embraces Finn] That was beautiful! Heh-heh. Let's go flush this in the sacred bathroom! Yo! Check, check, one, two! Hey! I'm Whoa! Yeah, yeah! Boo! That was pre-written. It's so obvious! Take him out, Finn! Off... Nope. Off the dome, here we go. Uh! I'm-a start it now. I'm-a battle now. We gonna make a rhyme, so I can rap this time. I rap for millions... [beat] sesquipedalians. [cheering] Yeah, that was tight. Whoo! [sees Rap Bear crying] Huh? Rap Bear, what's wrong, man? How can I be No way! You are the best! Going up against you was a dream come true. I look up to you, man. You're like... You're like my hero, Rap Bear. Awesome. [hugs Finn] Thank you, Finn. [cheering] I thought Billy was your hero. Yeah, but Billy's dead, so... Billy. Ha-ha! Check out these dummies. [jumping and clapping] Ha-ha! Yeah! You're awesome Billy! Ha-ha! You're gonna pay for this, Billy! Sick. [laughs] I love rap music, but only when it's good rap. Finn! Finn! Finn. Huh? Who dat? I'm Canyon, Billy's ex-girlfriend. Say what?! That's so weird. I was just— [stammering] Party Pat was just like— What's going on here? Who's that? This is Billy's ex-girlfriend. His special Lady? No, his ex-girlfriend. Oh, man, I'm sorry. Well, I hope you guys get back together. Whoo-oop! [leaves] Jake's still in denial about Billy. Billy and I broke up four years ago, but I held on to this. [takes out brown cloth] [gasps] Billy's loincloth! After Billy died, I couldn't keep it in my place anymore. I heard you guys were friends, so when I saw your name on the rap battle flyer, I thought it would be cool to bring it to you. [coughs] Oh, that's some smelly. [leaves] Thank you, Canyon. I guess I've been in denial, too. Have you been back to Billy's crack? No, I can't. It's time to go see Billy's crack. Shouldn't Jake be here? He needs more time. This would mess him up too much. [enters crack] [gasps] Fairies! Oh, they've infested the place! Okay, you guys, out! This is Billy's crack. Billy got aced by the Lich. We have dibs on the crack, so beat it! I'll dib up your brains if you don't respect the mems of Billy. Flimsy threats! Like a tiny blade of grass in a maelstrom, you are. That storm is me, You think you can chump me like that? This breeze feels great, doofus! All right. Laters. Um, so, Canyon, why did you and Billy break up? Huh? Oh. Well, I loved Billy, and I believed in him, but then Billy stopped believing, and that jammed up our whole deal—being a top-tier, red-belt power couple. After a while, all he did was watch movies and play video games. Pretty lame, right? So I bailed. Even heroes have slumps, bro. Yeah, I know. I heard he was making a comeback, too. What a weird world.  What the—? [takes a rolled-up paper out of the motorcycle] What is it? It looks like Billy's bucket list. Whoa, let me see! Hmm. Looks like he got to most of these. He sure lived a full life. Okay, here's one. Wait. "Tell [shrugs] I don't know. Okay, that's gonna bother me forever. Well—well, here's one more. We should do it for Billy. What's that? Are you sure you're okay? [screams] Holy shram! Whoo! That was awesome, Finn. You know, you remind me of Billy when he was young. Whoa. So... can I see you sometime? I have a feeling our paths will cross again. Take care, Finn. [takes out bucket list] "Take Canyon on one last ride." [crosses it out and drops his pencil] Whoops. [As he picks up his pencil, he sees something written in the corner.] What? Another item? You sneaky Billy. "Lie on my back in the ocean. Just float." Cool. [screams] Why the ocean, Billy?! Okay, I'm afraid. I'm afraid! Oh, dang, here he comes! Here comes the Fear Feaster! Way to go, Finn the Coward. Still afraid of the ocean, eh? [laughs] You should just give up! You're not a hero. You're a wimp-o! A cringing, cowardly— Hey, where you going? Fool, I come with. Ha-ha! I'm gonna nosh on your insecurities. Then I'll—I'll squat on your hopes. So now what, little boy? Huh? Uh, hey, man, don't do anything stupid. Hey! You're too chicken to face your fears with open eyes? This stank is cheating! This stank is for Billy. [hits himself in the head with the board] No! [goes back inside Finn] Huh? [continues swimming, then looks back again] Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! For Billy! Wake up. Wake up! [gasps and pants, struggling to stay afloat] [laughs] Huh? Whoa! [laughs] No mortal blade can harm— Was that you or me? Huh? Hey. Hey! I—I'm doing it! [laughs] I'm not afraid of the ocean anymore! I'm doing it, Billy.  You finished my list. Now I can rest like a great hero. Thank you, Finn. You're welcome. Canyon helped, too. Tell Canyon I watch her sleep. Man, love is weird, Finn. I know. Is that the thing you wanted to tell me? No. Goodbye. Wait. Billy! What? What's the thing you wanted to tell me? Oh, uh, you must go to the Citadel. That's where your father is. Joshua's not alive. Me and Jake buried him behind the— Not Joshua! Your other dad. Dad the Human. What? Your father, Finn. He's alive. Thanks, bro! There for you, bro... but Finn, I'm gonna tell you something gently. [concerned] Okay. What is it, bro? Get a new sword. What you do mean? Bro, these guys could've hurt you. It still works. [swings it] Hyut! Bro... I love this sword. [hugs it] It'll be okay. Let's go shopping! Candles! Candles! Candles for all occasions! Hey! There's Choose Goose! [looks at Finn and runs toward Choose Goose excitedly] Goose! Come on! [realizes that Finn has not moved and runs back to him] Finn? What's wrong? Mm, maybe we should try someone else. What? But we have history with him—that's important in business. Yeah, but we're lookin' for a sword. Remember that armor he sold us? [motions his hands in the shape of an hourglass] [winces] Ooh. Yeah, okay. I asked around. This is the place to get sa-words. [motions to a grass tipi in front of them] Oh. Doesn't look like it's open. Open! [They walk inside.] Close the curtains behind you, please. Walk towards the candle. How can I help you? Need a sword. Hold on. [brings out a sword] Here you go a grass sword. It's a bargain. I don't know. I've never used a grass sword before. Maybe we should keep lookin'. Swords like this don't come around every day. Don't come around every day, uh? [wields the sword] I love it. Well, that was easy. [as Finn and Jake walk out] Remember, no take backs. Hey, the pillow vendor! Huh? Hyut! [slices it in half] Huh? Pizza?! Yeah! Came outta nowhere! It was gonna bonk you on the head. You're getting good with that sword. You were never able to do that with your other swords. No more pizza bonks. Hyut! [swishes the sword] Hey, we're near Tree Trunks' house. Let's stop by and get some pie. Pie! [swishing sword] Hyut! Hyut! Hyaaaah!♪ Howdy, boys! Nice pillow and nice sword. My hands are full, Finn. Uh, you mind slicin' an apple for me? [rolls an apple toward him] Hyut! [slices apple perfectly] Something is terribly wrong with that awful sword. He's gettin' really good. He saved me from pizza. That apple slicing is too perfect... demonically perfect. That sword is cursed! [laugh] I like it when Tree Trunks gets all serious. Uh, how's that curse doin'? Makin' you want to moidle me? [laughs] No, man. This sword doesn't seem to have any curse on it, as far as I can tell. [stabs at the air] Hyah! Well, okay. [tries taking the tag off his pillow with his teeth] Dang tag. I got it! Hmm? [gasps] Whoa! Hey, quit showin' off, bro! Sorry, man. I don't know what happened. I-I... I'll go put this away. Good idea. [puts the pillow in his bed, gets on top of it, and starts sleeping] [screams] [pants] Huh? [unzips sleeping bag, finding the sword in his hand] What the—? [pants frantically] [sighs] Jeez. Stupid... [kicks it] thing! [It falls into the river below.] Worst three bucks I've ever spent. [gasps] [looks at his arm, seeing no sword] Whew. [shrieks] What's goin' on? The sword is after my flesh! Huh? Oh, snap! Don't let it get me, Jake! Don't worry. I'll handle this. [wraps his apron around the sword's hilt and sheathes it in a baguette] There. [sighs] Let's go return that junk. Huh. Hey, he's not here. Hmm. Maybe someone around here knows where he is. Somebody in trouble! Help! They're taking our candles! It's the Hooligans Who Love Candles! Let's get 'em! [drops his pack and sword] Hey! Huh? Yo! You got a prob, Bob? Stealing candles from old ladies is immoral! [punches them] [kicks another in the face] Anarchy! [throws candle at Finn] [catches it and throws it back] School! [kicks him] Hyah! Aah! Stop chasing us! Happy birthday. [bashes Finn's head with candle] [brandishing candle] You're dead, teddy boy. No. You've saved our shop! Thank you so much, you brave young man. And don't even worry about the damages. We'll just use the broken pieces to build a life-sized candle in your likeness. Oh, and we'll put it right by the entrance, and it'll be our mascot—the candle man! Dude... [winces] Yeah... not comin' off. Don't give up, man. Hey, maybe Choose Goose knows where the old man went. Hey, Choogles! We need your help. We gotta find the dude who sold us this cursed sword. You know who he is? I know you did business with some rando guy. Help you backstabbers—Why should I? What? Come on, Choogie, it was only one time. Hmm. I made a mistake, CG. This merch is totally defective. [earnestly] Please. Okay-dokay... I know that quack with the grassy shack. He's a wizard from the grassy plain. He lives atop the grassy moun... tayn. Awesome. Wizard of Grassy Moun-tayn... Mountain. Yeah, thanks, Choogs. Yeah, thanks! [shouting after them] He's the only one who can lift the curse, but beware... He's a huge ding-wad—just the worst. Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop! [screams] Hmm. For a cursed dingus, you cut so good. Come forth, wizard, and uncurse my mitt! Grassy Mountain Wizard! Comin' up here tryin' to enter my house! Are you for real?! [uses his powers to bring out his household objects made of grass] Mow 'em down, my cursed grassy objects! [sends them flying through the air toward Finn and Jake] Hyah! [slices all the objects while running toward the wizard] Uh... go forth! Go... uh, forth. [looks inside his house] That was all my grassy objects. [points his sword at the wizard] Lift the curse. [laughs] Never! You have no power over me, young fool! The grass sword will be part of you for all eternity! [laughs] [contemplates for a moment] Hmm. You know what? [backs off from wizard] I think I'm cool with that. What? Whoa. [laughs] [extends and retracts his sword a few times] Now that you've accepted it, you can control it! [extends it] Yeah. [retracts it] This is really cool! [extends it] I just had to get used to it. [retracts it] That's not how people are supposed to react to an eternal curse! Whatevs. [laughs] Do it again! [laughs] Why don't we call, like child services? Or an exterminator? This is gonna work. Just trust me, a'ight? Ugh. Do as I do. Boy, I just love walking through our delightfully not-creepy doorway. Don't you, Jake? Uh-huh, uh-huh. [shrieking] Walking through the not-creepy air to my not-creepy couch, sitting on my not-creepy butt. [chuckles]Your butt is kinda creepy. I say 'creepy' is just another label we use to distance ourselves from stuff we don't understand. Or that it reminds us of something in ourselves that we're not comfortable with. I mean, it just ain't an actual thing, you know? Unless you choose to believe it. Right, Jake? It's baloney! It's baloney! It's Starchy's baloney! I just got to think of something wholesome. (as Jake's imagination) [speaks korean] 파이 먹자. (Let's eat a pie.) "B.R.B. - Jake". Hmm. B.R.B... B.R.B. Bring regular babies. Big red balls. No. Beautiful rump burger. What you doing, Finn? Jake left me this note, but I, uh [tuts] I can't remem what the abbreve means. [Gasps] It's for me! This is Jake's special code to tell me he loves me. No, it's something normal like, uh... Be right back. [He walks away.] Right! "Be right back!" [Laughs] So dumb. Cool. Jake'll be right back. Look, Finn! My Jake Valentines. He leaves them for me when he goes out. That's cute, BMO. Yeah, I know. Oh, Ble. I love Ble! [Taking the magazine] I'll read some Ble 'til Jake gets back, I guess. [Reading out loud] "What's your favorite food?" "Anything! As long as it's made of cheese!" [Laughs] Aw, man, these comics are like if someone put my soul on a page. [Turns the page where there is an illustration of a saber-toothed cat biting a caveman while a doctor writes on a clipboard.] Hmm? "You write the caption." Okay! Hmm. [Thinks of something and laughs to himself, taking a pen from his backpack to begin writing.] "Ouch! Hey, this isn't helping." [Chuckles] Yeah. [Calling out] Ja - I mean, BMO! Check this funny caption I just wrote. Hmm. [He begins beeping and his faceplate reads "scanning humor", then turns into an exclamation point.] No humor detected. What? No, it's - it's like... this guy's problem is a tiger biting his foot, and talking to this guy isn't helping! Like, "Ouch! Hey, this isn't helping!" You know, like, it's, you know, like... Was the tiger already biting his foot? Or did the tiger bite his foot after he lay down on the couch? Because that is the bearded man's responsibility. BMO, I love you, but you don't understand comedy. Maybe it's just not funny. [Gasps] This is funny, and I'm gonna prove it! You are? Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty bored, and this is really funny, BMO. [Shouting] Prove it! [Angrily] Fine! I'm going to! Fine! [Squashes the banana.] I'll be right here! Fine! Fine! Bwee-woo-bwee-woo! This is a drill! [She shoots a house with her laser gun and the wall explodes.] I repeat, this is a drill! [She shoots another house.] Oh no! A real drill?! You two, raise your resinous glaze shields! [She shoots at the two candy people and the house behind them explodes. Several seconds too late, they lift up a pane of shielding that was supposed to defend against the shot.] Oh, oh, oh, oh! Activate the B.H.T. to preserve freshness! We're not ready. Intruder! Intruder! It's our friend, Finn! What's all the hubbub, Bubs? Oh, just some precautionary exercises in case our primary alarm and defense system fails. Cool. Cool. Hey, can you look at this funny thing I wrote? Oh, sure! I'm fascinated by humor. [Finn hands her the comic and she puts on her glasses to read it.] Hmm! Yes. Certainly what this hirsute gentleman needs is a tetanus shot. Excellent point, Finn. No, but... is it funny? Never mind. I don't have time to explain the psychology of humor to you. [She picks up a baseball bat, smashes the front window of a nearby bookstore, and takes a book.] But I'd like you to read this book. [Emerging from the bookstore] Hey, what do you think you're - Oh! Princess Bubblegum! [Bubblegum hands him the bat.] Thank you, Princess. Der Witz Und Seine Beziehung Zum Unterbewussten. "The Joke and his Relation to the Unconscious". It's printed in Gebrochene Schrift, which I think is easier on the eyes. "Der Witz Und... Der Witz Und... See-einy... Bezeyhung... Zumbewuzzzz..." Ugh! PB's too smart. That's why she doesn't get my joke. I mean... it's funny. [He sits on a tree root and takes out the comic.] It's funny. "Ouch, hey this isn't-" [Chuckles] "This isn't helping." [Snickers] Uh, it's super funny. Turbo-nerds like PB just aren't the right audience for this sort of thing, you know? I should show this to normal people, the common folk. The busy woman on the go. The regular Joe or Josephine. Or somebody like Ice King, who's desperate for my approval. [Laughing] Finn, this is so funny! A kitty with big teeth?! Come on! [Chuckles] Yeah, I didn't draw that, but cool. Well, thanks for- Oh, yeah. But, uh, what if - and I'm just spitballin'. What if it was something more like, "Hey, Doc! I got a caveman in my teeth!" Huh? Haha! Whoo! Heh. Yeah. That's pretty good, I guess. Oh, is this Ble? I love Ble! That one with the two cops who are always accidentally arresting each other. Right?! And "Animal Quackers"! I've been mailing them my short stories and comics for as long as I can remember. But, uh, nary a piece published. Nary a piece. [Suddenly angry.] Nary a piece! I hate Ble! Sittin' in their ivory towers! They don't know comedy! They don't understand the common folk! The busy woman on the go! [Together] The average Joe or Josephine! Right! See? We got the goods, you and I, and they've lost their touch. Hey, if we want them to touch our goods, we should go down there and confront them face-to-face. And if I get my winning caption printed, everybody will know it's funny! I'm talking about you, BMO. But, uh, where do they print Ble? Oh, yeah. I don't, uh... Oh! Oh! Yeah, hold this. I'll use my... demonic wishing eye! Hello, Ice King. Hello, Wishy! What do you like to wish for? I wish to go to Ble! You go, girl! Whoa. Why don't you just use that thing all the time? Oh, it takes a piece of your soul each time you use it. But look! The legendary Bledquarters! It must be so fun to work here, just sittin' around, making up jokes all day. Hey! Hey. Aww. Who are you? I'm a pudding troll, and I guard this humor magazine. Uhhhh, why? It's... my job. Why is this your job? I... applied? I'm maybe not following you. I think I better escort you off the premises. No! No, no, no. We just want to pitch a cartoon caption! [Speaking to the second face on his belly.] Hey, Big Tina, it's your time to shine, okay? Waahh! Okay, what's our plan here? Maybe if we eat all this ammo, he'll be forced to make more for us. Wait. You can fly! Uh-oh! Angle up, Big Tina! Uh-oh! Ugh! You win. Fine. I've never let anyone inside before, so I hope you have an amazing pitch. Hey! These are all my submissions! They kept them in a big pile by the door... Seems like a good sign! Well, shoot, man. Looks like everyone here is crazy dead. I've been guarding dead people for five hundred years. Wow, I need to sit with that. This means that Ble Magazine is dead, too! [He sits on a skeletons lap at one of the desks.] Now how am I supposed to prove my caption's funny. Ding dong! I found Ble 217! We can see what the winning caption was. [Reading] "I'm going to write you a prescription for one giant club." [Scoffs] It's about time us young guns took the reins. Hello, boys. Now let's roll these presses one last time. Our very own Ble Magazine. And it's a pretty good issue, too. We got that nice cover you did, my short story, "Fionna and Cake Baby Detectives", some, looks like, pudding jokes... Big Tina wrote those! ..."Fionna and Cake Baby Detectives Go to College", and, of course, your caption! Wow. It looks amazing in print. Guys, I'm gonna be honest, just speaking as an average Josephine, I really don't get that caption. Maybe it doesn't matter if my caption is funny or not. I think I just wanted to be part of Ble. It's something I've been a fan of for so long. And maybe we can bring it back. There's no reason it can't have a new dawn. A Blennaissance! Okay, boys, close her down! [Shouting over the destruction] No, you're right. Can't be nostalgic! Man, that caption was amazing in my head. Maybe I'm not a very funny person. Like, I got low comedy stats. That's kind of a bummer. Yo, BMO. Check it out! I got Ble to publish my caption, even though I don't need you to think I'm funny anymo- Get it, get it! [Jumps with a sword.] Yah! [Jumps with a lion-shape shield.] Oooooooh! Get him out! Don't you ever let me catch you here again! Whoo-hoo! Ya ha ha ha ha! [Closes the door] Agh! Ow! [Zooms in to a little splinter] Ooooooow! Agh agh mee duh! Did he get you with his poison stingers? No, I got a splinter from the door. Let me see. Wow, that's a tiny splinter. But it hurts! I'm gonna need some... [Flashes to a different scene with a thimble on I am Man, I am so protected right now! That is mighty thick. Go on, hit me! [Another knight hits him with a sword and it breaks in half. They clap. Knight 2 makes an okay sign with his fingers and the other knights cheer.] Hey guys! Check this out! Dude, hit me! [Jake punches Oh. [Punches thimble] [Makes an okay sign with his fingers] Click-click! That is but a thimble! This [Hits his armor twice] is real armor! [They all laugh again but Sir Slicer shows up on his horse with birds calling and flying everywhere.] Wha? Sir Slicer! [All bow] Who is the one that bears the thimble? This dude. [Points at Finn] Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, you foolish boy. Without full body armor, you're weak! You do not look [Makes okay sign with his fingers] Click-click! Ha ha ha ha. Yah! [Rides on his horse away and Finn and Jake run to Choose Goose.] Choose Goose, I need more armor. I've got something for you --[Holds up metal shoe] a metal shoe! Don't ya know you might stub your toe? Uhh, no, Choose Goose. I need... Look here hun. Choose this one to protect your buns [Holds up armor shorts with big butt cheeks in back]! Protect his butt! Protect his butt! [Cheeks turn more red] No, Choose Goose. I want-- Don't be meek. What if you fall down and scrape your cheek? Look at his butt! [Falls over] Look at his butt! [Smacks Choose Goose in the face] Choose Goose, I want the most [Makes okay sign with fingers] Click-click armor you have! Ooh, have a look! [Points at the armors with his foot] [Sees one with a skull on the front golden all around that a silver hat with a golden horseshoe on the top red sleeves black over the sleeves and golden things on the side of the hat.] I'll take that one! [Eyes glow] [Gets the armor Finn wants] Wonderful! I'll need a trade of equal value. I'll take the head of your dog friend! Say what? No way! Choose Goose, this stuff is overpriced! No money for me? How about a poem for free? [Looks at the knights and, cheeks turning red, looks back at Choose Goose] A poem? If you can decipher the poem and complete the trials, you will receive the magical Armor of Zeldron. It is foretold to be totally [makes okay sign with his fingers] Click-click! Skadow! [Hands Finn the poem] Your quest begins in the marsh over the hill. Ah, yes! I'm gonna get that armor! Yeah, man, you're gonna do it! [Starts to go and Sir Slicer shows up] Good luck exposing your soft, vanilla-strawberry skin to the elements, dork! Haaaaaaa! Later, losers! [Goes away on his horse] Ja! [Cuts to another scene] He's just jealous that I'm gonna have cooler armor than him! Yeah, what a bumbleberry! Whoa! [Comes to a place with lot of curtains] What's the poem say? "The sun nibbles on the clouds, and gum drop tears rain down." I don't get it... [Feels the poem] Hmm... It means that we have to cross that swamp. How'd you understand that? You don't just read the poetry to understand it. You got to [feels it] feel it. Trust me, dude-- I'm smarter than everyone. Now get in there! You're not coming? No way, man. This armor thing is your deal! [ [starts walking in the swamp] This place will be a piece of... [moves a curtain and sees an old lady taking a shower] Aah! Aaaaah!!![face turns red] Oh, my gosh! I'm so sorry! [covers his face closes that curtain and opens another curtain, sees another old lady taking a shower] Aaaaaaaaah!!! Oh, no! [An old guy walks in] [drops his soap when he sees Finn] My most private parts peeped by a boy! Huuuh!!! [Closes that one and opens another curtain and sees a mom giving a baby a shower] Aah! Pervert! I'm not a pervert! [face turns more red] You should be ashamed of yourself! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! [his whole face turns red and goes through lots of other curtains and finally gets to Jake. My privates! I'm sorry! My privates! I'm sorry! You okay, man? No! [Sir Slicer shows up] Ha ha ha ha ha! Wha?! What's the matter, crimson cheeks? Feeling a little embarrassed in the swamp of embarrassment? [Camera turns to Finn] You're so red, you look like a tomato. Ha ha ha ha! [ Aahhhh! We'll see who's embarrassed when I get that armor! What does the poem say? [feels the poem] Hmm... Ooh! "The meadow weeps as morning sings of milk and honey and things to come." What does that even mean?! It means we have to silence the echoing in the woods. [they hear echoing and look over a bush to see what it was] Huh! [They see a Red-faced Monster crying] Aw, man! I don't know how to silence that! All right, I'll handle this one, dude. No. This is my burden. Then just make her think it's her idea. That's how you make the ladies do what you want. [Walks up to the animal] Hey, Monster Lady! Hey! Stop crying! Huh? Stop crying because that's what you want to do! Hu ha huh? [picks Finn up and smiles] Huh?! Ahh!!! Ahh!!! Ahh ahh ahh!!! Ahh ahh!!! [The monster pictures Oho... [cradling Finn back and forth] Ha ha ha! She thinks you're her red-faced baby or something. I think she wants ya to nurse, dude! Noo!!! Aaa! Ooh! Mmm! [then Sir Slicer shows up] Huh? Minstrel? [A lyre player comes out and sings "Finn the Blushing Baby"] "He's Finn the blushing baby / His cheeks are bright and red! / Be sure to make fun of him before you go to bed!" Grandfathers will sing that to their grandchildren for generations to come. Grandfathers will not sing that to their children! [The monster tries to chop Sir Slicer but he puts up his arm which had armor and hurt the monster's hand] Oh! Armor, [Makes okay sign with his fingers] Click-click. [He leaves on his horse] Just wait till I have the Armor of Zeldron! Yeah! Just you wait, weirdo! [Just then, a shadow cast over Jake? You okay? Huh? [just then Jake's arm came out of the fur on the animal right in front of Yeah! Awesome! Yeah! Whoa! [They came to a door that says "Home of Zeldron's Armor"] Finally! [kicks the door open] Yah! [A ghost appears] Hello! Begone, ghost! I'm here for the armor! First, you have to beat my high score in a game of Drop Ball [throwing the ball in the air] Drop Ball? Drop Ball is an extremely addictive, high-intensity game designed for people everywhere. Here, let me show ya. [He throws the ball under him, bends down, and picks it up with his butt] Hut! One point. [Finn's face turns red] Two points. Three points. This game looks awful. Oh, no. I absolutely disagree! [to Jake] Dude, let's just kill him and get the armor. How? He's already dead. Here. It's your turn. Now, I don't want you to be intimidated, but my high score is six! Guh! Just -- just toss it on the ground. [He throws the ball under No, no, no! You're doing it all wrong! Let me show you how the pros do it! [He bends his knees and picks it up] See? It's all in the technique. Now, I'm gonna put a little finesse into it, just to shake things up. [Finn and Jake go to the next room while his back is turned] Whoa! [they see a big shiny light] Finn, its so beautiful! Yeah -- guess all the embarrassment was worth it. [Then orbs of the light come out] Greetings, young traveler. We know what you seek, and you shall receive it. [The light struck Finn putting him in the air] Behold -- the Armor of Zeldron! It will protect you from evil, even ghosts. [Then the light put it on Finn] Huh?! Aah!! [Which he found out it was a woman's armor] No! Dude, this is lady armor! [Makes okay sign with fingers] Click-click! [Makes okay sign with fingers] Click-click! No! Not Click-click! No more embarrassment! [He takes it off] I don't need armor! [Kicks door open] You did not watch my Drop-Ball technique! Huh? I give you firsthand tips that no one else knows, and this is how you thank me?! I absolutely disagree with that! [turns in to a monster-like creature] Raarg! Now what? Put on the armor! It'll protect you from evil, even ghosts! Never! Yaaaaaaah! [ [Picks Finn up and starts to take his soul] Hey! Huh? Mama? Uhh... Yeah! [In a high pitched voice] Listen when your mother is speaking to you! Yes, Mama. [High pitched voice] You should be ashamed of yourself -- a boy your age sitting in this cave alone for thousands of years. You need to go outside and get some sunlight! But I... [High pitched voice and is pointing] No back talk! Outside! Now! [Puts Finn down and the monster ghost goes outside, burns from sunlight and then turns back to a normal person] Whoa. Oh, thank you, Finn and Jake! You've freed me from the addiction of Drop Ball! [normal voice] No problem, dude. I couldn't have done it without [pointing up] the power of embarrassment! And I learned I don't need armor to be -- [Sir Slicer shows up] Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Look at you losers. Finn, you don't have any armor, and your friend is dressed like a lady! Ha ha ha! So not Click-click! Well, at least I don't spend my day following a kid around! Get a life, dude! Ha ha ha ha Good one, Finn. Yeah ha ha. Well, I've... just been in the same areas today. Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Yeah, right! Whatever! Be quiet! I -- I am more Click-click than all of you! Come over here and say that to my fist! Okay, I will! [Gets down from his horse, falls down and lands on side] Whoa! Er... Ugh, this armor's too heavy! Ah, no problem. I'll just prop myself up on this stick. [Grabs a stick] Aghhh! Splinter! Hey, Sir Slicer, maybe you can use this! [He holds up the thimble] Here you go! [Throws it at Sir Slicer's face] Oh! Free of charge! [Picks up Finn with his butt and flings him on his back] Come on, dude, let's get out of here. Ha ha! [Cheeks turn red] Okay, buddy. [Flies over Sir Slicer with the armor] Wa-hoo! [Flies over the 3 mountain tops, breaking them] Dude, this armor is totally Click-click! Did you know there are more stars in the sky than there are grains of sand in the sky? It’s true. This is a rare asteroid made entirely of heavy metal. His name is Lars Darksaber. I don’t know any of these guys. Whoa! Look at that big boy go! That’s gonna be the biggest comet I ever did I – [A Space Moth swallows the comet.] What the heck? Let’s forget we saw this. Just another ineffable mystery in a universe of mysteries. [Picks up a floating pick] I wrote this song for my hat! [Singing] ♪ Some people say that space is lonely silent, empty, sparkling, and immense. But wide open spaces put smiles on cowboy faces, even when they’re stuck inside their tents. Yes, I’ve got my mission to distract me, from friendly folds I had to leave back home.

Time to make the doughnuts. [Exits the spacecraft] Boy, that meteoroid storm was scary. There probably won’t be scary cool things on Mars. It will just be me, alone. You’ll always have me, BMO. Yes Football, but I meant new interesting people. [Singing] ♪ I've left my dream of grand adventure... [Singing, cont'd] ♪ For the quiet of my Martian 'tater farm.  ♪ [Notices someone behind him] Hi! You can stretch! Do you talk? Hmm. Well, you're round and green, so I'm going to call you Olive. After my favorite type of bread. My name is You like what you see, huh? You got the good taste. Huh? What are you doing? Ah! That was Mars! We are going the wrong way! Olive! [Screams; the spacetime is undergoing a strange warp] So trippy! Oh no no no! The stars are all jacked! Olive! You interfered with my mission!  [Growls] Okay I changed my mind! You can interfere, Olive! Please! 15 minutes have elapsed. Subject continues to struggle like a dum-dum. Its attempts are pitiful. But I am sworn not to interfere. [Notified by some beeps of her device.] [Voice via the device] Y4, report! I found a weird bug bot on a rock. Ah, Hugo's not gonna care about that. Don't come back until you find something useful. Yes, ma'am. [The call ended; sighs.] [Observing silently nearby, upside-down with her multi-functional boots] This is great! New entry. Gray Elves and Shell People are squaring off over a newly excavated site. But which side will prevail? Do the less-dominant Shells fail to grasp the importance of the Elves' unity mission? Elves! By the laws of the Drift, we assert our claim to this very sweet photon transmogger. Heck, no, Cole. The transmogger belongs to Mr. M. I have the receipt. From you. You sold it, man. That never happened! And/or I don't remember doing it! WE need that part! I challenge you to a drift duel. One-on-one, Cole. Last man standing gets the transmogger, AKA me. Oh, you think you're so tough with your lava blaster. But it's no match for my... [Grunts as he making green bubbles over his back] stink sacs! Such a rare and majestic sight. Ew! No, thank you. Ooh, stink you right up. On the count of five. One, two, thr... Now, Lenny Longlegs! Hey, you're cheating! This is it! Ha, ha! The Elves stand victorious ag... It's ruined! No! No! No! No! Aaaaah! Aaaaah! Aaaaah! Aaaaah! Phew! I thought that I was toast bread for sure. But I'm completely uninjured! Lucky I didn't crash into anything important. Ha! You weird babies. That's nothing to cry about. It's just garbage trash. Shelves! I... Ugh, I mean Elves and Shells, I propose a truce. Let us put aside our conflict. Good babies. Let us join our forces, and together, united, destroy that little robot! What? Oh, no. Get him! After the robot! But I'm so cute. Huh? Get them! [Laughs] You're a rabbit! Get him! Aaah! Aah! They have terrible aim. Keep both eyes open! Robot, what the heck? Cheese, I'm in trouble! We'll go around! Hup! [Throws a stink sac to Y4.] Blah, why did I interfere? Oh, stupid, stupid, stupid! Tantrum babies. Aah! S-Sorry! Sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry! Don't hate me! Move over! [stuck in the hole] I'm stuck. Mr. M? Well? Where's the transmogger? Some little bot came outta nowhere a-and trashed it. But we'll track him down, sir. Forget him! Go back and see if you can salvage the pieces. Shouldn't we report this to Hugo? Oh! No need to worry. I'll take care of that personally. Field log, supplementary. After, uh, thoughtful consideration, I've scientifically decided to take the alien robot in for further study, scientifically. So beautiful! [sees some malfunctioning droids, of Olive's kind, near them] More Olives? Finally! Huh? Where are we? My secret lab.  [hovers and lands upside down on the rock above them.] A secret lab? [gasps] A secret lab! It's just how I've always pictured it, for the last two minutes. There's gotta be an "off" switch somewhere. Aah! Don't look at my bottom! It can simulate embarrassment. Its maker must have been a weirdo. I'm a self-made man. But who are you? You can call me No, that's boring. I will call you Harmonica. I don't like that. It's funny, though. I have thought about calling myself something else. Yeah, that's what I did. I called myself Really? 'Cause it looks like it's just printed on your side there. Okay, thank you. Pick a name now. Okay. Hypothetically, how about Wiiii... Five? I love it!  Hello, I guess I gotta knock you out now. For science. Oh. He's yours?  That old maintenance droid seems to think you're important. Olive? She's a no-good-for-nothing troublemaker. Don't give me that puppy eye! Serious? What's the worst a li'l robot can do? You know, you guys don't really have to hang around. Pssh! That dang robot has to come back to this ship eventually. Bob, do you have any threes? Uh, go fish. [the wall starts to shake and an air leak sucks the cards away.] My winning hand! I got a bad feeling. Woop, woop, woop, woop! I hear that everywhere I go. The atmosphere is getting sucked out of the breach! We need to vacate this pod! No, I need my ship! Your ship is long gone! Lead the way, lady. [They hear a scream.] [o.s.] I do not like this! Come on, Y5! Toward the screaming! But that's not what I do! It's what I do - sometimes. [Gasps] Hooray! I can't stay mad at you, magic skateboard. Come on, Y5! Against all rational thought, the intrepid researcher returns to the breach to... Holy! [Screaming] Help! Ooh, look at those legs waggle! [To Shafter] Gimme the blowtorch! No! Mine! Oh, no! Ahhh! Ahhh! Oh! Hey, wait. [sucked away into space] He died as he lived... sucking big time. Crab guy! Crab guy! You need to throw your shields all at once! Uh, no. Why would I? Because Shells, throw your shields when the green box commands! Now! [shoots the lava blaster and seals the breach, which stop the leak.] Easy like potato pie. BMO, that was incredible. You single-handedly saved everyone! Olive. [Olive turns into a loudspeaker.] Okay. I know what you're all thinking. With my ship gone, I am trapped here. So, yes, I will save your terrible land. It does need saving, correct? Yes. Very well. Then I appoint myself your new sheriff. Now, show me where the trouble is! Well, there's a lot of trouble in the drift. [projects a map of The Drift.] Woof. Looks like I'm gonna need a deputy. [Olive turns into a badge for Y5, making her heartwarming.] I can't pay you. BMO... you've just been summoned to... meet some very influential citizens. That's great! It will give me a chance to check out my new stomping grounds. Great! Back home, I'd only walk this far by accident. What was the name of your home world again? It is far from here. A little blue-and-green planet called ... Never heard of it. Phew! Aah. I need to make a pit stop. Oh, my goodness! Hello, big cousin! Welcome, driftgoer. It's just a Hugomat. They're literally everywhere. Cool! Your... sports energy drink is ready. [Drinks fast] Whew! Energy drinks. The future is amazing. Golly. Did you make all of this? No. I didn't personally build an ancient space station. Whoa! Buy my eggs! Buy my eggs! Or I swear to glob I'll eat them myself! Hey, check out this hothouse mess. Nobody goes into Jungle Pod. The life forms have all mutated into strange and dangerous things. Come on. I will play with you, strange things. Dude, climb with your legs, not your arms. I'm getting tired! We're almost there, Sweetie! Come on! What are you up to? Uh, well, hello, there, Sheriff BMO. My brother and I are just, uh, climbing up to the coin slot of this Hugomat for some, uh, exercise. We love fitness! You two sound like some fishy four flushers. I've got my eye on you... fishies! I'm so scared. What's wrong, partner? Hey, you're that new guy who's all over the inter-pod streams. Yes, I'm famous. Now tell us why you're crying, ugly man. Well, it's one of my baby space lards. It won't come back in from stargrazin'. Which is what I call grazin'. They look so cold and scared! Man, I don't know what I would have done if this tender little baby had frozen... [with a ferocious face] before I could eat it. What?! You want in on this? I make my own sauce. In my sauce gland. No! I saved this lard. You will repay me by caring for him and keeping him safe forever. Also, his name is Ricky! Yaa! Yes, sir. Gimme that! [takes away the toot] This robot expends energy in ways that yield it no benefit. So weird. Deputy, carry this. I don't have pockets. It's another gravity outage! Blooey. This station is trash. I've got my work cut out for me. Don't worry. Hugo's got a plan to fix things. Who's Hugo? [Singing] "♪ Hey, baby, I hear the blues a-callin' tossed salads and scrambled eggs. ♪" Oh, my. "♪ And maybe I seem a bit confused... ♪" I think I know this song. [cont'd] ♪ But I got you pegged... ♪ Forget about that old robot. We've got a mission, remember? [cont'd] Good night, Seattle! We love you! 01110000, 01100001, 01110011, 01110011, 01110111, 01101111, 01110010, 01100100. Who are we going to see again? I forgot. [sees the underground world outside, gasps] Bunnies! So many bunnies! Haha, this one runs a hotel! [Behind the door] ... if he's impressed with it, our place on the Unity Pod is a lock. If Y4's data isn't flawed... Which, you know... Um, I'm back. Mom? Dad? Come look what I found. Oh, my brain! A functioning service droid! I haven't seen one of these in forever. Mom, let me introduce you to... Howdy, Mom! Nice to meet... There's bound to be useful U-Pod parts in here. We should call Mr. M! I did good, right? These are some great... parts. Another failure? It's in Communications Pod! There's never been one this close before! What do we do? BMO likes alarms. Y4, hush! The adults are talking. ... Eet you! Huh? BMO! There's a pod in danger. Let's ride! [runs upstairs, humming] Y4! What about Mr. M? Don't worry. I'll watch over the, uh, parts. Come on, keep printing stuff we can heist this thing with. We gotta bail! Wait! It's our duty to evacuate the citizens. I will save you, weird duck! I'm fine! Aah! Robots can't go in the water! Fine! You are my arms and legs. Now help me get everyone to safety! Excuse me. We're too small and stupid to save ourselves. Don't worry, Bumbos. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Shush! Hey, use your big brain and think of another way out of here. Um... Oh! There's another hatch over this way. Hop, hop, hop, hop. Hop, hop, hop, hop. Hop, hop, hop, hop. Through here. Hop, hop, hop, hop. Wait, I think I forgot something. Can I go back? Get out! Okay. Sheriff! We messed up! Aaaaah! You can swim, right? Yes, but badly. Giddy up! [stomps her] Ow! [KS-2 is calling.] H-Hello? Y4! Where are you?! Mr. M is on his way to pick up that unit for dismemberment. Heading back now! Aaaah! What's going on? Aaaah! Get me outta here! Y5, chew through the glass with your big, nasty teeth. [Olive turns into an ax.] Huh? Yay, Olive! Swing! Swing now! Hup! [cuts the Hugomat open with Olive.] Geez, careful much? You almost smashed our loot. Yeah, watch it next time. Can't this rabbit swim any faster? On it. [lights one of the fireworks in their loots.] Did you just light a firework on my - [screams; they boost just fast enough before a pod gate closes.] I told you we would make it. You sure are a worried wart, Olive. Hey, Flatfoot, we found this thing inside the Hugomat. We don't know what it does. So, it's yours. [throws a flash drive to BMO, who plugs it in his socket.] Ooh, that's smooth data. I can't believe I did that. How did it feel? Kinda... good, actually. Of course! You're my deputy, after all! Oh! R-Right. Listen, BMO. Yes, my true friend? Uh, BMO, there's something I need to tell you. Get in the car. We should accept this ride from a stranger. This is a pretty sick ride, I gotta say. Is that...? That's the answer to all the Drift's problems! Behold! The Unity Pod! Oh, I thought it was a popcorn maker. Hugo's whippin' up some pretty sweet gadgets in there, the raddest stuff your little bot eyes will ever see. Oh, boy. [Talks to herself] So what if Hugo takes BMO apart? It... It's for the greater good, right? And I am all about the greater good. Greater good! So many Hugomats. Yep, yep. I actually came up with those myself. Isn't that right, boss? Huh? Uh, yes. Ha, uh, the Hugo. That boy loves flashy gadgets. Me? I'm more of a pragmatist. You must be KS-2's daughter. Nice to meet you. Uh, you, too, also. Is this the spicy tech I heard about? You are so gray, and bald. Ha! Yeah, I am. [notices Olive] Oh! Uh... Noice! Buh... Mr. M, why don't you entertain our guests for a bit? You're a kid. Kids love dumb games, right? Um... Great! The greater good. What do you say we spice things up a bit? If I win, I get those fancy grav boots. What? No way. Oh, come on. If I lose, you get my fancy boots. Ugh. [gasps as she sees Hugo is "drilling" BMO.] Dang, this robot is one-of-a-kind. But nothing here I can use. Bummer. Well, maybe next time, KS-2's daughter. Not so fast! The sheriff is here to help. Tell me what you need. Okay... We've located the final component for the Unity Pod... the Genesis Crystal. Unfortunately, it lies within the impenetrable Jungle Pod. And all our attempts to grab it have been hot garbo. So, we're engineering our own. How's it going, guys? I think we've finally cracked it, sir. Permission to run a test? [Hugo whistles.] Cool, cool. Commencing test 325. Huh? [distracted; accidentally pressing one of her cards] That... That shouldn't count! Tough beans, kid. A deal's a deal. No! Sorry, Hugo. Please don't be mad. You are not a very good scientist! Oh. Reset for test 326. No, I will get you the real junk. What? Oh... Really? I'm your Huckleberry. Now, I gotta agree with the little bot, boss. He's quick, plants won't eat him... That's right. Plants hate me! I'm smelling what you're baking. Smells good. You know what? Let's try it. What the heck? Um, is that... Saddle up, deputy! We are going to find some treasure! Are you really sure about this? I believe in us. I'll meet you out front. Aah! Mom, uh, what, uh... There was some kind of accident at the crystal lab. Apparently the new prototype exploded... again. Oh, Mom. Don't worry about that fake. The Why isn't BMO in a million pieces?! Uh, Hugo didn't need him? Fantastic! So we're back at square one. Lady, stop talking. Come on, sidekick deputy! What?! You're following that little toy's orders?! No! I'm just following Hugo's orders! Y4! Tell me the truth! ... I'm sorry, Mom. I-I was just humoring it at first. So we could get to Hugo, no fuss. But I got carried away. I know I'm not some "deputy," alright? It was just a dumb game. You two comin' or what? Yeah. I am. Because I'm the only one around here that doesn't bite. Aah! Stop it, Bad Olive! Olive! Let him go. I don't need your help. BMO, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings! I have no feelings! Forget about her, champ. Big, cool guys like us don't need nobody else. You make my feelings happy! Y4! Come on! Yes, ma'am. Yep, this doesn't feel dangerous at all. Aren't you coming? Oh, uh, no. It's real easy to get lost in J-Pod. So I'll be guiding you with this map. Oh. But couldn't we bring the map? Think fast. [throws a walkie-talkie] We'll stay in touch through that walkie-talkie. You'll only be alone in the, uh, literal sense.  Please, don't bring me in there, BMO. [Via the walkie-talkie] Keep walking straight for 1,400 frames. Copy that. 1,002, 1,003, 1,004. I don't like this place, BMO. You are a delicate soul, Football. But BMO, I'm scared. Oh, Football. I know you're a scaredy cat, but I have to complete my mission. BMO, I think maybe you're also scared of this mission. No. BMO, if you bonk this up and die, I couldn't live with myself. Oh, Football, I won't bonk up. Aah! Whack! Whack! Aaaaaah! [flees] Lucky this hole was here. Oh. Not lucky, BMO. You are in the dirt hole now. Dirt hole! Aaaaah! Run, Aah! Ew! You are my gross ticket out of here! Crusty piece of crab! [ Crusty! [Via the walkie-talkie] BMO? BMO! That was a close call, Mr. M. Mother Drift got a taste of Whose mother? Y4! Could you bring me a J-clamp from out by the... Where are your gravity boots? I was playing cards with... You gambled?! What?! No! The... It was Mr... Honestly, Y4! We'll talk about this later. Ha! Wait. That's another Hugomat stick. I wonder what's on these. [Olive forms a drive socket.] Wow. Okay. I didn't know you could do that. [Olive projects the data in the drive.] Whoa! What the h... Hey, good job, li'l guy! You'll be on top of the crystal in a mm-bop! It's...  mad indignant. All of the Hugomats are networked. Mr. M has them identifying useful components in each pod without anyone knowing. That's so unethical. I hope BMO is okay. I don't feel good about this, BMO. I'm going to take this crystal, Football. I'm going to be a hero. I don't need a deputy! I don't need anybody! Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot! Look, Olive. The Genesis Crystal is moving. BMO did it! Wait. Wait, wait, wait! All of the failed pods are missing components. By taking them, Mr. M is killing the Drift. We have to warn Hugo! Blood! Blood-erflies! Mr. M! I got the crystal! Throw it here so you can run faster! [BMO does so.] Yes! Now catch me! [jumps] Oh. [whistles] Very unfortunate. Oh, BMO, you tried, but you were never the hero of the story I like to call life. You were always just the cute sidekick. Football! Oh, no, don't cry, BMO. You know I'm an empath. Huh?! No! No! Football! Help! BMO! Oh. This is probably bad, huh? I think I'm dying. But that's okay. Mnh-mnh. Not this time. But I'm supposed to save the Drift. That's my job. Now your job is to be dead. Oh, no. BMO, you can get through this. Really? Just kidding. You're not a hero. You're nothing but a little kid, BMO. Oh. No. Hugo! Hugo, Hugo, Hugo! I never had to do this much exercise before I ran into BMO... Aah! [runs into KS-2] I've been waiting for those J-clamps. Mom, look what I grabbed from Mr. M's office! He's behind all of it... The Drift collapse, the pod failures. He's a no-good, rootin'-tootin' four flusher! I don't know if those are swear words, but that sassy robot has messed you up. [Takes away the drive.] What's up, bunnies? Hopefully nothing... slanderous. I am so sorry, sir. [Give the drive to Mr. M.] No harm done. [Hides the drive under his suit.] Ha! I've already got all the proof backed up right here! [Takes Olive, but nothing happens.] Woof. Mom! Where's BMO? Uhp, uhp, uhp. The good news is that he got the Genesis Crystal. The even better news is that li'l BMO died a hero. Hurrah! No! I have to save him! No, Y4! My name is Y4! Ha. Kids, right? Always calling out their deadbeat parents. What? What? I can't do this alone. Olive's gone. It's too far to the Jungle Pod. I'm too slow. Huh [She finds the lard toot, which she blows and summons Ricky instantly.] Ricky! Aah! [Ricky cuddles BMO! I'll get you... o-o-o-o-ut! [pulls BMO's arm out] Aah! [notices BMO's parts next to them; screams with Ricky] Aah! Stop! Stop! Hey, back off! We had to squeeze all these parts out of a sealed pod. That's my friend! I'll sell you the parts. Ain't this the bunny that what, like, saved us? Please! The Drift is in danger, and BMO's the only one people will listen to! Ohh, my conscience gland. We may know somebody who can help. Ha! Yo, CGO. You up? CGO? I smell that goody scrap. I call dibs. Make us an offer. What? Cut it out! I-I mean, ma'am, these two said you could patch up the sheriff. Hmm. This is a MO Co. Bot. You know this model? I'm practically a cousin, a janky off-brand cousin. Yeah, but can you do it, though? Hmm... probs. Whoo-hoo! With BMO's cred, we can convince Hugo to stop Mr. M's schemes. Hugo? I don't know what you've heard, but Hugo is the worst. What do you know? Uh, duh. He created me. We go way back, to the real busted last days of Earth. [flashbacks] Hugo had a big brain and a rocket and led an exodus to the stars on the cheap. The Grays warned him about the dangers of bio-hacking their alien style, but Hugo gets his way. Then we were saved by a orb. The Drift was already breaking down when we got here. But after Hugo set up shop, well, he just makes everything worse. I got chucked into the trash. That little service droid went back into space. Poor thing. I wonder if she ever found what she was looking for. [Flashback ends.]  Hugo's a great guy... as long as he thinks you're good for something. Hey, quit leaking on my scrap. Fingers crossed. [presses BMO's button] Maybe he needs to warm up a bit. Whoop. Was that me? Ow! BMO, you have to wake up! I can't fix this! I'm just a little kid! I said the same thing when I was dying. You saved me. You can save the Drift. But it's just too much. Even when things look really, really stupid, we still have to try. Our suns all went out. That's nothing. All our crops are dying. It's gross. Oof! Pod fails. They're spreading everywhere. Y4 was right! I've never heard you say those words. Hugo! You have to shut down the priming sequence! We're on the verge of station-wide collapse! Uh, this is exactly the kind of problem the Unity Pod team will be working to prevent. Ohh! Everyone, wait!  Hugo's up to no good! There's proof in this Hugomat! Oh! Are you trying to get another drive? Do you still have the data? That smooth, smooth data. Right here. [projects the data to the Unity Pod; everyone gasps] You're donking it all up, Hugo! Do you deny it? Nah, it's all true. The Unity Pod was always designed to save only myself and my loyal inner circle. The rest of the Drift is... Well, it's unfortunate collateral damage in the grand scheme of things. Besides, this all can't be on me. Y'all thought the Unity Pod sounded like a sweet deal, as long as you thought you were getting a piece of the pie. But if anyone was offended by my actions, I am truly, truly... [presses the button and destroys the control panel with a rod, running into the Unity Pod, which activates..] Well, time for me to get the heck out of here. [flies to the surface of the Unity Pod with a rocket pack] Wuh-oh! There's no way to stop the activation process. The station's power will be sucked dry! No! We were so close! Why don't we just pull the plug? If we remove the plug before it's powered up, it won't turn on. The robot is right. The only way we can stop the U-Pod from draining all the juice from the Drift is to eject it. Yes! Brute force! Everyone, we're going to need a lot of muscle. I got muscle. Lard muscle. Go on! Put yer bumps into it! Swing those shields, Shells! Use your handsome bodies! Go, go, go! Ice that pod! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Well, here comes the rascal. Ahhhhh! We did it! Oh! No, we did it! Hold up, everyone! I don't want to be a downer, but we just launched all of our best resources into space. [People talk to each other unsettled] Is it too late to get on the U-Pod? It's true. Most of the station is dead now, and all communications are down. We're going to have to manage the remaining resources to survive. We need to learn how to help each other. I know it's hard, but we have to try, or we won't make it. I'll give it a shot. Yeah. We can teach y'all how to steal and, uh... Forage for spare parts in the defunct pods. We'll rebuild Hugo's old lab. Maybe we can find some non-apocalyptic energy. Y5? Can you forgive us? We were so focused on getting our family to a better place that we lost our way. You're an amazing person, Y5. Yep, it's time for this sheriff to move on. Ricky, let's ride! Yee-haw! Huh? Oh, it's you. Still disappointed in me? [Olive cuddles him.] Ha! ... And I grabbed as many snacks as I wanted. The end. I should tell that story to Y5 next time I see her. I bet she will be mayor by then. Huh? We are here! I will strap in. Ricky, you beast! Now go! Be free! My name is Twinkletoes. Oh, okay. Who's that? [Laughs] Dancing is cool! Check it out, yo! [preforms the "arm wave"] Aaa! Ha haa! This one is called "The Worm"! [Flops on its belly. Suddenly a giant purple bird swoops in and picks up Oh no, it's crazy far. [It looks back to see the Giant bird still asleep and then escapes by climbing over the side to the edge of the cliff.] Okay, now easy does it. Easy...easy..." Hey man it’s safe in here!! You can hide in here!! [This causes BMO to tumble off the edge] Oh, shoot man, uh ooh. Eeeeeh! [Tumbles down a dirty hill side until it hits a rock and lands on its face. A loud crack is heard as I hear that, friend. Do you mind if I wallow with you a bit? I'm a bubble. Okay, nothing stopping a bubble. [Shrugs] [Sighs] That's what they say. [rests on a small mound] Looks like you've given up on things. I'm thinking about giving up on things myself. I've been lost in this wilderness a long time. Maybe you and me can wait here, to get eaten by a carnivore! No, Bubble. I know two heroes who can help you! You do? Yes! Help me get to my home, and, and we will help you find your home! Your friends sound great! [Trying to climb over a rock and a branch] They are! They are huge! Well then, what are we waiting for? Nothing!! [Waves its arms excitedly] Hey, so tell me about your home, BMO. I live in a tree house [trips and stumbles] it's really funny. Cool. Yeah! [trips and stumbles again] What about your home? My home? I think that my home is very large and very beautiful. But I can't pin down these memories it... haunts me. [Turns back to see BMO has tripped and fell on its face.] Oops, I wasn't listening to your story. What was that? It's a carnivore waiting to eat us. Nooo! [hides behind BMO.] Don't worry Bubble, [picks up a mushroom] I got everything under control. [Walking in the direction of the sound, [Gurgles and squeals at BMO.] [Comes out of hiding] What's a baby doing in the wilderness? He must be lost like us! We should take him with us. Maybe we can help him find his home, too. What a handsome baby. [looks at the baby's left hand, which is flipper-like and covers it with a leaf] Handsome baby. Bubble, what do you think our baby's name is? How about "Sparkle"? No, I think he looks like a "Ricky." Hmmm. Oo, Bubble! Ricky! Look! [It drops the baby's hand to see a rickety bridge and a long drop to a river] I have a bad news the bridge doesn't have guard rails. I don't think we should cross it then. I don't think we have any choice! I really sure there really is a carnivore this time! [turns towards the baby who gets up] Ricky, you should go first. [Gurgles] [Pulls the baby close] You are so beautiful... and I love you. Go Ricky! [ [Crawls to the middle of the bridge] Okay, Ricky, slow and steady, [The baby crawls to the side of the bridge.] Ricky...Ricky? Ricky! Sparkle! [The baby tumbles over the bridge's side.] [Runs to the area the baby fell] Bravery! [and dives after him] Oh nooo-o-o-o! [Gurgles and floats on its back down the river] [Emerges from the water and climbs on his head] One second, sweetie! Hmm, a deadly water fall! BMO? Bubble, you have to save our lives! Eeeeh... maybe I can, hold out this leaf. [Pushes tiny leaf down.] Thank you Bubble! I think my batteries are wet. [opens hatch bottom and batteries drop out] Good-bye [Falls over] [Gurgles and picks up the batteries and places them back into BMO's compartment] [Turns on] Oooo, good morning everyone, I didn't have any dreams. [Starts fussing. Its face turns red and appears about to cry.] He looks fussy; maybe he's hungry. My hungry baby, what am I going to do with you? [Kisses the baby's foot] [Sits up and faces BMO, who has picked up a rock] Potato. [Becomes more upset] Eat your potato, Ricky! [Takes the rock and begins to suck on it. This appears to calm it down.] It's the carnivore! Everybody! Hide! [ [Sucks on the rock and pats its belly] [Crawls out of the stump to grab Ricky by the foot and attempt to get him inside] Oh, Ricky. Help me out here! [Emerges from the trees with her flipper hand against her lips] [Gasps] My baby! [Seeing its mother, puts its own flipper hand to his lips and blows.] I was so worried about you, Sparkle! Sparkle... [Begins to pull Sparkle out of the trunk with BMO trying to pull him back in.] No, Ricky! No, no no! No, no! BMO, that's his mom! Let go! [Whines.] [Holding up Sparkle] My beautiful baby. [Sparkle shrieks happily.] [She frowns at BMO] You should be ashamed of yourself! [Walks back into the forest] [Looks down at the ground] Hey, the path ahead looks pretty clear and there were these... uh, there... BMO, are you okay? I am sad, Bubble. I miss baby Ricky. I miss him so much already. And I miss Finn and I miss Jake. And I got dirt all in my butt circuits! And Bubble... Yes, BMO? I-I don't think I'm ever going to get home again. Don't cry. Sparkle is safe now and we did that. Thanks to us he's going to grow up and be anything he wants to be a strapping horse whisperer or a sexy hitman or whatever. And things are looking up for us, too; I saw some bugs up ahead who look pretty with it. [Puts its hands to its face plate and gasps] Maybe they can gives us directions or something. Oh, my gosh! Oh oh oh! Bubble! What?! I know those guys, Bubble! Those are my homeboys, my homeboys, those are my homeboys! We are close to my home! [Excited gasp] Yeeah! Come on, BMO! Yeah!! [Falls on its face] Yeeaah! It's been so long, I can't wait to have some bread-and-butter! [Giggles] [Bangs on the door with both fists] [Attempts to knock on the door as well by bumping into it] [Knocks with one fist] [From inside the house] Jake, is that you at the door? Naw, man, I'm in the kitchen making us breakfast. I call 'not answer the door' then. [Grumbles] Alright, hang on out there I'm comin' [Clatter, grunts, and yells are heard as it sounds like [Looks to Bubble] Might be a minute. [The noises continue and Um hey, so, BMO, since we have a little time, there is something I've been wanting to say. Hm? I know I might never find my real home. [Gasps] No, Bubble, that's not true! It is, I know it is, but it's... it's okay, because I realized something, all this time we've been together, BMO, I haven't felt lost, I felt at home. [Noises continue as And, it's you, BMO, I feel at home with. [Puts its hands to its face plate and gasps blushing.] So, I thought- I mean if you feel the same way, I thought we could get married. I-I mean... I'm not even sure what that means exactly but- I do! Oh, I do! I do! [Laughs heartily] Hey, a bubble! Pop! [laugh] Bubble? Bubble? [wails] No! No no no, my Bubble! No!! [falls on the grass] What's so funny? Oh, it's just BMO, he's pretending to be all messed up because his bubble got popped. [chuckles] Oooh, heh haha, that is pretty funny. [Muffled] Oh, Bubble, I'm so sorry I brought you here! [crying sounds] [Disembodied voice is heard] There, there, BMO, it's okay. [Rolls on its side to look around] Bubble? Is that you? I hear you in my head but I don't see you! [Snickering] Oh no, have I gone bananas?! No, BMO, it's okay. You see, I'm finally free. I don't understand, Bubble. No, not Yeaay!! [Waves its hands around] Oh, b-but wait, now you don't need me... to feel... at home. Nooo, see that's what's so great. Now we can be together forever, BMO, every minute of every day. No more privacy, no more quiet, no more alone. Every room you ever go in, I'll already be there... waiting... forever and ever, until the end of time. Yaaaaay!! [Waves its hands around] Haha! Take that, Master Chen! JAAAAKE! What? Jake, did you hide my sock? No, man, I told you, I don't do that kinda stuff anymore. So, what? It just magically disappeared? I don't know... Maybe. Is that just a cute way of saying you took it? No! Why don't you just help me find my sock? [Sarcastically] Oh, Finn lost his sock! Everybody stop what you're doing and help Finn find his precious sock! [Voiceover] It looked like a tough case to crack. But I hate to see good friends fight. [V.O.] So I decided to take the case. [V.O.] Hmm... [Gasps.] [V.O.] Ronnie! [V.O.] It looked like I had a guilty mouse. [Gasps.] Huh! Hello, Ronnie. What do you want, BMO? Where is Finn's sock? I don't know what you're talking about, BMO. I didn't do nothin'. Leave me alone! [V.O.] I knew that lipstick anywhere. [ [Speaking] How is Lorraine? You stay away from her! She is with me now, do you hear? Calm down, big guy. Me and Lorraine are dinosaur bones. Good, 'cause I would be so jealous. Just tell me where the sock is, and I will let you go. I don't know, man. What if I put some knuckle in your eyeballs? Would that help you think? Ok! Ok! Umm... It looks like a grape juice stain on his sock; check the pantry. [V.O.] Of course I didn't trust Ronnie, but I had no other leads. [goes in the pantry] Maybe the grape juice had some secrets to tell me. Or maybe Ronnie was just pulling my hair. [climbed up to where the grape juice was] [V.O.] Just as I thought, not even opened. I fell right into his trap. [pantry door closed] [Gasps] Let me out, you! I'll get you! Piece of... you! Ronnie! [the door opens and BMO, what are you doing here? Looking for Finn's socks, same as you. We got this to under control. [licks his hand] Stay out of police business, or you will be the one behind bars. [V.O.] [climbing up a ladder] I didn't listen to that cop. I needed to find Ronnie, and I knew just the lady who could lead me to him. [at the top was Lorraine's house] She looked as beautiful as ever. Where is the sock, Lorraine? What makes you think I know? I saw your lipstick on his fur, so don't act so cute. Sounds like someone's jealous, no? Don't count on it, Lorraine. Now tell me where Ronnie is. Ha! You think it was Ronnie? Maybe if he was man enough to steal a sock, I wouldn't have to spend my nights with Bebe. Bebe? So you're saying Bebe is man enough? What? No, you're putting words in my mouth. Bebe doesn't know anything about Finn's sock. [Gasps] Finn's sock? How did you know it was Finn's sock? I never said whose sock was stolen, Lorraine. Uh... uh... I heard it on the TV news. No dice, sweet beak. Officer Davis has this case under tight wraps. Oh, fine, Bebe stole the sock. Oh, BMO, can't you just forget about it? [walking out the door] Sorry, lady, forgetting ain't in my job description. Ha ha ha! Does that mean you still remember... us? ... Hahaha! Same old Lorraine. Well, don't tell Ronnie about me and Bebe. [zoom to reveal Ronnie is watching in the rafters] You know how he gets when he's jealous. [Ronnie's nose twitches as the door closes.] [V.O.] Bebe owned Bebe's, a dance club downtown. [Zoom to Bebe.] He yells at ladies! Wake up, brainiac. BMO? Uh...uh...auh! Where is the sock, Bebe? Uh [coughs]... I don't know nothing about socks! Don't play dumb, Bebe! [takes some soot and smothers it on Bebe] Don't play dumb with me! [Coughs even more.] I talked to Lorraine, Bebe. She sold you out, dumb dumb! No! She-she wouldn't do that! It wasn't me, I swear! It was Ronnie! [stops rubbing in the ashes on Bebe] Ronnie? But why? I don't know, man! I don't know! [Starts sobbing] Oh, Lorraine! [Continues sobbing] [looks at its dirty hands] I'm gonna go wash this shmutz off my grabbers. When I get back, you better start talking sense! [V.O.] [Turning on the water and throwing some on himself.] It wasn't adding up. Why would Ronnie swipe the sock? And why would Lorraine finger Bebe? [ [Talking to himself in the mirror] I don't really get it. [V.O.] Maybe it was time to cut my losses. Come on, Bebe, let's get you cleaned up. Bebe? Bebe! [pauses] Dead. This doesn't look good. I'd better hightail it! Huh? The cops!? It was a setup! [Gasps] Oh no! [Starts running and imitating gunshots] Bang, bang! Pew, pew, pew! Hey, has anyone seen BMO? [opens a cupboard] BMO? Where's BMO? [at the sink] Hello? [at a window] I'm worried about BMO. [at sink, with unbroken mirror] This is real. [reopening the cupboard] BMO! [in dark room] Who's Hello. [the word "hello" echos as BMO wakes up] Hello? Hello? Hello? Hey, BMO. Wake up, buddy. Are you alright? Neptr? I feel like I got hit with a Dracula by King Kong. Whoa, sorry, man. You want some pie or something? Sorry, I gotta run. The cops are after me. Have you seen any down here? Nah, no one's been down here all day except me, you, and Ronnie. What?! What was Ronnie doing down here?! I don't know, but now my sensors indicate that some treasure is missing [ [gasp] That's it! That's why Ronnie took the sock To carry stolen treasure in with! He had to whack Bebe to keep him from squealing, then he pinned the rap on me. Bebe's dead? Listen, Neptr you better lay low for awhile. I'm gonna go find Ronnie [ Hey, BMO. We should hang out more. We're both robots. No, Neptr. I am not like you. Ronnie? Evening, BMO. Don't worry, buddy. You're off the hook. We know it was Ronnie who killed Bebe and snatched the treasure [meow]. We found this confession on him after the shootout. Hmmmmm...what about the sock? Forget the sock, BMO. The case is closed. Let it go, buddy. It's over. Maybe he was right. But I just couldn't shake the feeling that, somehow, this case had slipped right through my fingers. [BMO sees lipstick on it's hands] Lipstick? [gasp] Lorraine! BMO? Get back here with that treasure, Lorraine! Sorry, BMO. I earned this loot. Those chumps were not framing themselves. See you around, BMO. Lorraine, wait! What about the sock, Lorraine? Oh, that old thing? I hid that where no one would ever find it in our secret, grown-up kissing spot. Remember? It was good to see you again, BMO [the barrel floats away]. Till next time. Till next time, Lorraine. Ya see, man? That was really fun. You don't need two socks to have fun. Yeah, I guess. But maybe it woulda been more fun with two socks! [sigh] Finn, Finn! I know where your sock is! Huh? [ Whoa haha! [drops Sea Lard] Right on, BMO! Ronnie the mouse stole it, but Lorraine chicken set him up to kill Bebe, but the flatfoot busted Ronnie, and Lorraine skedaddled with the loot, but Yay, BMO! Yay! Yeah! Yay, Yay! Yay, Our chicken's name is Lorraine? She's red hot like pizza supper [blushes]. [GASPS] Whew. A goblet of sparkling apple juice for milady. Thanks, Finn. Hey where'd you get this goblet? Oh, uh, I think we won it in a fight with an octopus we were fighting in, like, a sea cave full of treasure? No. It was from when BMO was playing dress-up. It reminds me of a cup my uncle used to have. You mean your Uncle Gumbald, right? Do tell. You never talk about your family. I don't know. Families are tricky. You guys know what I mean, right? [ Marceline and Finn nod yes, Jake nods no] We have to go back a ways Like 800 years ago. [Sighs] Help! Help me! Oh, goodness me. Someone please help me. I'm a defenseless little goblin surrounded by all this loot. Boo-hoo. Oh, you poor thing, here. Have a drink to ease your nerves while I untie you. Pfft! Aah! The time for faking is over now. Give me all your stuff. [Chuckles] What? You brought a peashooter to a techno-harpoon fight?! [SNAP] Aah! [Groans] [Gets electrocuted] Aah-aah-aaah! Another close call today, Neddy. [Squeals] [Whimpers] Neddy, you sweet chicken. [Beatboxing] It was a lot different back in the Mother Gum. We all had each other's backs. I'm going to make more of us, Neddy. I know you don't care, and that's fine. But I need to be around people like me. O-kay! This is it, Neddy. We're getting relatives! [Laughs] It worked! [To the elderly female figure on far right]Your name is Aunt Lolly! A pleasure to meet you, dear. [To the young male figure in the middle] And you're Cousin Chicle. You're a full 2.3 meters tall. Naturally I am a gentleman of high standing. Oh, Cousin Chicle. And finally Uncle Gumbald! This is your favorite mug. Ah, yes. [Examines mug] I'm your GREAT uncle. The mug proclaims it so. Aren't they great, Neddy? You'll be my protectors, my advisers, my family. [WHIMPERS] I'm heading out, Neddy. [Notices the trees are gone] What? What? What?! Morning, small niece. Uncle Gumbald, the taffy trees are gone! I know. I chopped 'em down last night. [Scene changes, Bubblegum is riding on a cart with Why does it look like your head? [LAUGHS] You're such a curious little girl. We're a lifestyle brand now. Success! Now instead of worrying about his dumb city, Uncle can come here to picnic, swim, and, uh fish! [Bubblegum in her makeshift lab] [Electricity crackles] Welcome to life, Candyfish. [GASPS] I can't breathe air! Bonnie! What have you done to my building site? I made us a butterscotch lake and a fish to live in it. But that's where the gift shop was gonna go.Now it's just gonna be volleyballs, water skis, and shrimp cocktails. Sounds nice. Did you say you "made" this creature? Come on. You'll appreciate him more once you watch him swim around.[Bubblegum walks outside with Candy Fish in hand] Bonnibel you've micromanaged me for the last time. [Notices a Magazine under Bubblegums pet rat “Science”] Huh? Hmm. I think it's time for Bonnie to be re-branded. Niece, now that I've had to stare at it for weeks, I've got to admit that your lake was a very good idea. Ja! Sehr gut! Very wunderbar. Oh, I'm so happy. We got you a gift to say thanks. It's right outside, Prinzessin. [GASPS] You got me a car? Yes, a car. But also a boyfriend! Hi, babe.Beep beep! Wait, what? All right, you nut. Have fun on your date. Date?! Let's go, babe. Beep beep! What a naive little child. Date's over, babe. Pick you up tomorrow to get matching tattoos. I'm back from that terrible date. Hello? Thank you for coming to the mandatory optimization meeting. Tonight, we address the "Bonnie problem". Bonnie problem? Our future city is on course to be a rousing success, barring only one obstacle Our complete lack of competent leadership. Oh, Cousin Chicle! Oh, Cousin Chicle! Dang, Chicle, that's cold. I have formulated a happy juice that will render her as docile and simple-minded as her cutie BF, young Mr.Creampuff. [Gasps] All we have to do is sprinkle some of this on her breakfast, and we'll be in charge.Let us celebrate with coup d'etat cupcakes. Poisoned cakes. [POOF!] Where am I? Oh, right, the poison. [POOF!] I don't know what's happening! Whee! Whee! Whee! Whee! Ah! My first candy employees. What have you done? This isn't what I made you to be. No, you wanted us to be lowly pet fish, swimming in your narcissistic pond. But I am your equal! You're not like me. You're bad. I am the future. Come on, Bonnie. Don't run away from happiness. I'm going to fix you. And then, I'm going to fix that sniveling gumwad, Neddy. Don't touch my brother! [Pulls our pea shooter] A pea-shooter? [The flask breaks] The juice! Nooooo! [LAUGHS] Hey! Where's the party? [GOOFY LAUGHTER] [Sighs] What a mess. But they do seem happier now So unburdened and pliable. You, the crunchy ball, dance for me. Sure. [Starts dancing] Come on, lady. Do the crunchy dance. Oh, Crunchy. Sure, I'll dance with my candy people. Yay for the lady! Call me Princess. Hurrah! Whoa, for real? Like I said, families are tricky. [GASPS] BMO! Where did you get this cup? From that guy! The guy on the cup! The guy who's face is on the cup! That guy! Yeow! Whoops. And I dub thee Sir Jake the Dog. You two now comprise the royal guard of the one true princess of Ooo. That's me! [winks] As such, you may no longer own property or operate children and must render all treasure and wives unto your sworn princess within a hangman's fortnight. [scoffs] Joke's on you, man. We spent all our treasure the other day. Plus, don't even have any wives. Wait, what? What about Lady? Lady's my girlfriend. Wait, but... That was Tree Trunks. Oh, yeah. We, the inhabitants of Ooo, owe you heroes our very lives. As the once powerful and dignified Princess Bubblegum sulked off into exile, it fell upon you two to save us from the impending comet of doom and/or from the hideous Orgalorg, who aimed to eat the powerful comet and grow invincible! And for that, we are eternally grateful. I know I am. But now your bravery is essential to a new heroic task! Can you guess what it is? Uh... Come on. Guess! Um... Fight a—Fight a dragon? Wrong! Follow me. [sighs] Man, this is stupid as heck. I miss PB. Yeah, yes... [panting] I mean, except for this sweet armor, though. This armor is hot like fire. Naw, the armor's stupid too. [muttering under his breath] Dang King of Ooo going around like DJ Snappy. This is it, fellas, the only spot in the kingdom left unscoured during my treasure census. I'm afraid it'll explode or something if I open it. But I really think there could, nay, there might be precious treasures in there. So I want you two to do it. Man, this...seems like a really bad idea. Yeah, well, it's an order from your princess. Get, get, get. [being pushed through the door] Hey, eh, ooh, oh, ah. [muffled] Come on! Alright, alright. Hello. We are the sworn protectors of the forbidden inner sanctum, and to proceed you must answer this ancient riddle...I forgot the riddle. That's okay. I love you. I love you too. Hey, there's stairs back here. I love you guys. [muttering] Woah. [panting] Wait up. It's a dragon...a candy dragon. Look. He sucks the vitamins from the roots. And transforms it into candy juice? And then—And then the juice goes in all those drains. This. This is the lifeblood of the whole kingdom. Power, defense, recreation. This is everything. It cleans, it nourishes, and—and... ♪Muh-muh-muh money, money.♪ Go on... What are you talking about with all this money talk? Yeah, why are you singing the money song? What, you don't see it? [laughing] They don't see it. Look, everyone needs juice to live, right? And I control the source of the juice, so by me charging a mere pittance for every single drop, I can easily quadruple my treasure pile! Man, if you think we're just gonna stand here and let... Although...if this dragon thing could pick up the pace a bit, we could have enough of a surplus left over to export worldwide! Hey, you there! What do you think about picking up the- [scared shrieks while crashing out through the wall] Looks like the Candy Kingdom empire is finished. But the four of us will live like kings 'til the juice runs out. What do you say, boys? Let's... Huh, I wonder where they ran off to. [scooting up to PB's cabin] Princess, Princess, Princess! Princess, Princess, Princess, Princess! Oh, hey boys! Princess, sklizz is really blizzed up with the King of Ooo! He really blizzed up all the sklizz. He blizzed it all up, man. Yeah, well maybe he should unblizz it then. [muttering to herself] Why do I always gotta unblizz everything? But Princess, under the tree there's—there's a dragon. And he took the juice! [gasps] Oh no. This is all my fault. Neddy... Princess? Princess, what is it? [sigh] That dragon you saw, he's my brother, Neddy. [gasps] [autotuned] Whaaaaaaaaa? We spawned together from the Mother Gum, and now I'm all he has. [squawks] Neddy's very sensitive. It's not safe for him out there. He needs my help, and I'll need yours. [falling backwards] Woah. [holding on to swan feathers] Ahhhhhhh. [oblivious] It's pretty quiet, huh? Okay, guys. Neddy's in this cave. I know because my bod rod here is calibrated to our sister-brother bond. Now, people frighten him, so I'm going in alone. If he tries to run, STOP HIM. I don't think we can. He's a giant. [thumbs up] Yup. Thanks, guys! [sigh] This armor is driving me nuts! No way, I changed my mind. I feel like a fancy shield. Or if I was like a dangerous candlestick. Like a knight's candlestick. You don't stretch, man. This thing's cramping my crimps! [grunting while stretching out of the armor] Woo! Dude, I don't like that. [shrieks] [tongue clucking] Neddy, you sweet weirdo. [more tongue clucking] [yawns, then falls asleep] [noticing the nourishing roots] Ooooh! OOOOH! [waking up in the bathtub] Oh nooo! I just want consistency! [taping sabers to the Old Banana Guards' arms] If the King of Ooo tries to come here again, you have my secret permission to stop him. No holds barred. Moosewood Stadium freestyle. [turning to Finn and Jake] So, what are you two up to now? Eh, garden stuff, I guess. Ummm... Hey Bonnie, you always act like a loner, right? But next to your brother, you're the light of the party. Sorry, the LIGHT of the party. I mean, yeah. One of the first things I did after making sure Neddy was safe was to start making the candy people. I was formed in the Mother Gum. My mind and my gum were in touch with dozens of others, like a crowded womb. I guess I missed that. But Neddy's from the same place you're from, and he's a wet hot dog around everyone. People get built different. We don't need to figure it out. We just need to respect it. Maybe he likes his own company better than I like mine. Well, do you miss the candy people? [shrug] Hey babaloos, good thing that juice is back on. I was making a mint, but hoo doggie, my candles were starting to turn. [laughing] Thanks, Jake. [showering in the juice] Ahh, that's the stuff. Hey, do you know if I can drink this? Like, is it like well water? Good for bathing, but not so good for drinking? You know what? I'm going for it! [spitting and coughing out the juice] Yup, it tastes just like you'd think. Aw, yes. Storm has passed! Jake! [runs toward Jake] Jake... Nachos? Nachos? I love nachos... [eats nachos] I love nachos even more when looking out of the window! [runs back to the window] Hmmm, does that box have a face on it? A face... I gotta make sure. [In a loud, fast tone] There's a box outside with a face on it! It might be the boxman, it's all soggy and dirty. Want to check it out? Naaaaa... chos. [Hands nachos to Jake] I'm gonna check it out. Yeah, whatever. Hmmm, where'd your face go? [starts examining it more closely] Whoa! Okay... shhh... are you lost, little cardboard dude? Jake! There seems to be a lost cat on the ground in a box! Yeah that's great, get it out of here! Hm, gettin' no help from him I guess. Do you know where your home is? Okay, I'll follow you! Whoa, is this your kingdom? It's wonderful! That must be your prince. [Shakes, with a sad expression.] Huh? Huh... a prince wouldn't steal from his subjects. [The cat licks [Moves its paws back and forth] Switched? [gasps] Of course! You must be the real prince, and that thief took your place! Is that right, little prince? [Rolls over and meows continuously.] [sighs] Don't worry, your majesty. I'll help you reclaim your kingdom. [Rubs the cat's head] [Stops the game] Why do you hate cats, Jake? Move your face, you're messing up the game. Anyway, I don't wanna talk about it, it's personal. Cats know what they did... Is Jake okay? Eugh... no! I'm pretty dang far from okay! There's a little shard of Tortilla chip caught between my teeth. [tries to use his tongue to get it out] First, we have to expose the traitor's deception. Ah-hah! That's a counterfeit crown, from the liar's own box flesh. Hmm... it looks like your crown was torn off by some... [Places hand on torn area] [Slaps Finn's hand away] Mew. Your crown was lost, you say? [Walks towards some plants, and starts circling one of them.] During a storm? The same storm that sent you hurling through the woods? Until you were delivered into my door step? Right... so it's definitely in the woods somewhere. All we have to do is find your crown to prove to your people that you're the real prince. [sniffs] Um... I'm gonna wait over by the gate, your highness. [Interrupting the game] Get big, and the chip will fall out of your teeth! You think I can stretch out of everything? You're so naïve. To live life, you need problems. That's stupid! If you get everything you want the minute you want it, then what's the point of livin'? Okay, so let's retrace your steps. Do you remember which path you took? ... Prince? Whoa, you found it already! Good work, team. [rubs the prince's belly, which causes him to scratch and bite his arm] Ow, quit that! [shakes him off of his arm] Come on, you're a prince. [takes out the crown] Come, your majesty. It's time... [Places box to use as a pedestal] People of the Box Kingdom, I have found... [pulls out crown and places it on the Box Prince] your true prince! [points to fake prince] J'accuse! What? They... they don't believe us. The rain made your complexion look all hobo-like. They're not looking past the surface grunk. Oh no, he's challenging you to a joust! I better find you a lance. Did it come out? You forgot the most important part, my impatient little friend. A thorough rinsing! [Puts water in mouth and starts rinsing] Well? [Spits out water] Bleh, nothing. [shakes head] I need, like, a toothpick, or something. I told you to buy floss. Floss is for losers. [walks out of the bathroom, and to his cards on the table] Oh, one of these will do nicely. You'll put cards in your mouth?! Just the edge, kid, then I'll work it like a pro. Now, to find the card that best suits my devil-may-care personality. Trial by combat shall prove which prince's true! The joust's gone nuts! Hey, BMO! Ta-da! [gasps] You did it, Jake! Congratulations! How did you get the piece of tortilla chip out of your teeth? Oh, I didn't. It's still there. [reveals teeth] It'll be like a constant reminder of what life's all about. ... This is unsatisfying! ZIP IT! [Sprays water on one of the princes.] Bad! Bad princes! Which is which...? [Licks Finn's leg.] Awwww! [Picks up Box Prince] This is the one! This is your prince! [Licks Finn's leg.] [Picks up the other Box Prince] Or maybe this is the one! Hmmm, is this... is this even a kingdom? Haha! Hey! Ow, you guys... aw, come on! [Examining Finn's arm] Hmm.... What is it? It's looking droopier. But I've been pounding pickle juice like I was preggos. For the electrolytes. Well, switch back to water. But what I really want to know, is how are you feeling Finn? What? Oh, I don't know. [imitates trumpet tooting], I guess I don't feel anything. Bleh. [slides off the bed] Okay, that's what I thought. You gotta bounce back, man. You got burned by your bad dad, you lost your arm, and all the ladies say you don't talk to Flame Princess no more. Who's sayin' that? Finn, flowers thrive on good vibes. As your doctor, I'm ordering you to go out and have fun, okay? You want to go with me to Crab Princess' party tonight? Uh, what? Like... as a date? Sure. That would be fun, right? Finn, I don't date my patients. It's cool. Guess I'll go make out with Crab Princess. Okay. Tell her I said "hi." ♪I'm lost in the darkness, what will this bring? Autumn descends on me,Autumn♪ ♪What do I see? Oh, so beautiful. My heart it beats. Oh, so magical.♪ ♪I'm lost in the darkness, what will this bring?♪ [Sighs] Aah! Watch it, Crab Princess! I'm sorry. You ain't my man, so why are you all up in my lumps?! [Grunts as she attempts to drink] Hey, Finn, could you pour this juice into my mouth? What? Pfft! [Breezy flies past I can't reach my juice. [Shaking off Breezy from his arm] Yo, come on bee! Geez! Oh, I'm so sorry, I didn't realize— Didn't realize what? That there's a person attached to this flower? Uh, yes. I'm sorry. But it's only because your flower's the greatest miracle of all time. It's just doing something to me, I—[tears up] Oh, that's cool. Thanks, beezy. My name's [muffled] Never mind, Finn. [The cup is on her mouth. She laughs and spits the cup away, then runs away laughing.] So uh, what are you doing here? Heh. Ah, well, I came here to make out with Crab Princess, but I sort of lost steam on the walk over. [Breezy stares intensely at I'll try for you, man. Whoa! Really? Yeah! I'm gonna help you, friend. Hey, Emerald Princess, you know what would blow this party up? What? If we all got in a line and just showed off our moves. Yeah! Do it! Oh, my glob! Aah ha ha! Haa! Thanks for walking me home, Finn. I'd invite you over, but you can't breathe underwater, right? Not usually, but can I have a kiss, please? Uh, okay... Okay. Good night, Crab Princess. Good night, Finn! [giggles, gurgles] Hey, you did it! Oh, you're still here. Yeah, [chuckles] just checking in... on my buddy. So, how you feelin', buddy? Pretty grease. I made out with Crab Princess, so that's grease. But really I don't feel nothing. Maybe if I made out, I will feel something? Maybe I'll reach a "good vibe" saturation point. And then my flower will feel good, too... Your flower feels good, yes. [laughs] Hey, cut it out, Breezy. Ha ha! I'm just messin' around. We're buddies, right? Yeah, Breezy, I like you. You're a good wingman. Yeah, wingman. I'm a girl, but all right! Let's wingman you some make-outs! [Sighs] [Whispering] [rattling] [Giggles] Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh! [Chuckles] What's up with your head? Eh, I'm trying something new. Hey, how's it going, miss...?  Whoa. You're a dead ringer for Flame Princess, with a smidge of Princess Bubblegum mixed in. [To Finn] Guess you're still hung up on both of 'em, bro. [Flips the table in front of him angrily] I ain't hung up on nobody! Nobody. Breezy, let's get out of here. Okay. She doesn't look anything like Flame Princess, does she? I don't know who that is. Exactly. [ Noooo... Listen, buddy, being a free spirit is fun and all, but you got a responsibility to that flower, just like I got a responsibility. Get this—I'm actually a virgin queen bee. I was born to lead a hive, destined for a life of obligation and ritual. Whoa. Bummer. Yes. Once I drink of the royal jelly, my carefree days are done. Dang. That sounds like raw deez. Breezy, you got to stay free... Free to make out with whatevs. [ Yeah, maybe you're right. You know, it's too bad we're such great buddies or we could make out with each other. [chuckles] What? Uh, nothing. Come on, pal! Lets run and be free. [chuckles nervously] Whoops! I tripped right into you [ That's right. Everybody's havin' fun... Whoops! Whoa! [humming] [laughing] What's that? Mnh-mnh! Hey, girl! Girl, I know you can hear me! [to Breezy] Girl, get back to your hive! Quit hanging out with that bologna tube! It's disgusting! Mnh-mnh. [rolls out of the water] Yo! Shut it! She's an independent lady! Yeah, shut it! A'ight! [opens door to hive] Hey! You guys want to roast a wiener? [Together] Yeah! Gonna teach you to mind your b's and q's, chump! [takes out a weapon and charges towards Finn] Buzzzzz! Uh! Run, Breezy! Aah! You're about to get waggle-danced, you chicken! [Finn punches the Ow! Ooh! [ Oh, no! Flower! I-I mean Finn! [gasps] [Clattering] aha! [flies back out] Don't worry, Finn! [ [groans] Breezy... No! [Gulps the royal jelly juice] [gasps] Aaaah. Hey, honeybuns! [Groans] Whoa! Oh, No! She got into our secret sauce, bro! It's all over! [All bee people] Long live the queen! [Now sitting up] Breezy? Yes, Finn. Can't you see? I've become a queen to save you because... I love your flower and—and I think... I love you! [opening a zip] Now you can partake of my pollen crumbles and become my drone. Um... You know, I'm—I'm trying to keep it casual, B. I just don't feel the same way. I don't feel anything. [Now sad] But I royal jellied for you. [sniffles] I'm lost in the darkness, Breezy. Finn. [Finn still dancing] Finn. [Shouting to Finn] I saw this already! [Finn falls down.] [Dance music stops playing.] [ Wha? Where you going? That's it. We made out. Wha—What?! I didn't wait infinity for a dip in the kiddie pool! We're taking this to the deep end! But I'm not a good swimmer. Don't be scared, Finn. Lumpy's on lifeguard duty. [to flower on his arm] How's it going, guy? Is any of this helping? I'm gonna forget you did that. Right in the vault. Whoa, whoa, whoooooa! [Dances with joy] Yeah! Whoo-hoo! [Waking up] What the lump? Oh, hey! Finn, you got your arm back! [laughing] Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Breezy... I can't believe I let you talk me into this. It's not like I have a lot of free time, you know. Peebs, you work too much. Imagine a pizza. Only half should be business. The rest should be personal. Personal pizza. Yuck. Try to have fun tonight. With the Ice King? Not in your everlasting lifetime, girlfriend. I wish you'd call him Simon. He's actually kind of sweet and funny. Can you please try to get along tonight? It would mean a lot to me. I'll try. Try anything once, that's what I say. Simon! What's this? It's a present. To bribe you for coming over. You don't have to bribe us, silly. We're here because we want to hang out with you. No one has ever said that to me before. You didn't say, "No take backs." Bottoms down. So, check it out! I upgraded my home karaoke system. Do you like karaoke? Duh! We love karaoke. Bonnie is a dynamo on the mike! Okay. You guys get started, I'll freshen up PB's drink. Marceline? Irslerskat prjon! Prjon, prjon Prrrrrrrrrrrrjon! Marceline! Get out here quick! What's going on? Something's wrong with the I.K. No! Simon! Hi, Marceline. Are you guys pranking me? Your friend just majorly malfunctioned! He was jerking around all weird, and his voice sounded like he was possessed! Cool out, B-Bell. I know you love karaoke, but you can't take it so seriously. I hope you like penguin cuisine. It's mostly just shapes. Who doesn't love a good rhomboid? You're a rhomboid. Here, Simon. I know these are your favos. Thanks, Gunther! He just called you "Gunther." He calls everybody Gunther. Bonnie! There's something really wrong with Simon. There's some wrong with Wait. You just called him Simon. Call me whatever you want. This is the best date I've been on since my last date. This is not a date. Neither was the last one. It was a robbery. For real? Yeah. She stole my heart. And my crown. Your crown. Crubs! He's really flipping out! [PB strikes on IK's head with an icicle] What'd you do that for?! It just makes things easier. I'm definitely seeing some weird activity here. It's really, really. You don't know what's going on. Maybe I can access it with my VR equipment. Whoa, Bon-bon! This stuff is rad. Why haven't you shown me before? I didn't think you liked science. I like games. We can play sometime. But this time, it's business. Whoa. This is not what I was expecting. Did you press the wrong button? I never press the wrong button. Yeah, you always know which button to press. I'm referring to the fact that you know how to annoy me. Yeah, I got that. What I don't get is this stupid scenery. At least it's got a pretty killer beat. Wow! Two newbies at the same time! How'd you manage that? Yeah, okay. I guess if you really squeeze together, it could fit you both. Who are you?! Are you a dinosaur? I'm a Okay, what's a dinosaur doing here? I'm practicing my drums. The others say the acoustics out here are better than in town. What the bleep?! Yeah. That's been happening lately. You're lucky you didn't get rearranged. Ooof! Does this circuit look infected to you? I don't know. I only deal in infectious grooves. Sounds like you guys need another brain. I'm gonna take you guys to the the professor! He's the smartest guy I know. Next to Master Evergreen, of course. Prjon. Hey, guys. Prjon. Hey, Goontz! Who are those dudes? That's Sveinn. He only wore the crown once. And the guy next to him says he's the first "Santa." Like, what's even a "Santa"? Dude, the Santa? Nope. Doesn't ring a bell. Aha! There he is! Professor Petrikov! Simon! Marcy! Dear! How is this possible? Did my beloved Betty master the secrets of the crown? No. Bonnibel scienced us in. You must be Betty's little assistant. Assistant?! I have been my own boss my entire life. I built my own lab! I've created freaking life forms! Okay! Actually, I haven't seen Betty since she came back to Ooo. But if Betty didn't send you, why are you here? The crown is going ba-nay-nays. It's making Ice King act super weird in the real world. Yes, I see. It seems to have infected much of the crown's labyrinth. I was actually just about to follow its path of destruction. A quest! Hey, Marcy, last time, I was so caught up in making things right with Betty that you got left out. I'm sorry. It's okay. I get it. So, you got a boyfriend yet? Ha! No. There was this guy once, but he was a real jerk, so I dumped him hard. Wish I'd been there to punch his face. Simon! I can punch my own jerks now. It's getting pretty bad. I think we're close. Yeah! Can't you hear my intense drumming? Magic Man? Magic Woman. Betty! This is the fabled Betty? I always pictured her more majestic. You know, with, guts and stuff. Betty, please, what are you doing? I'm re-programming the crown's wish magic. Got to fix Simon. A-ha! I'm a bush! It's just on backwards. Betty's the one who's backwards. We got to get her malware out of here before she causes irreparable damage. Now! Now! Hoo! Now! Aaah! There has to be a part of the real Betty in there somewhere, Gunther. If only I could reach out to her. Okay. Get in there and reach. I think I will. Betty? I'm the reason you're doing all this. I'm busy. Remember how we met? When we both reached for the same book in the library, and I said you should check it out first? And when you returned it, you left a note inside, because you knew I'd borrow it next? It was the funniest, smartest note I've ever read. I... have to work. Betty, I love you so much, but you can't help me like this. I can and I will help you, Simon! You remember me! I-I Stay with that feeling, Betty! Stay with it! Betty! Simon? Betty! I can't believe it's really you! Technically I'm a magical A.I. avatar derived from Betty's memories. Close enough! Shwang! The system appears to be stabilizing. Crown shields are coming back online. What does that mean? The crown will re-seal itself off from foreign entities. But I-I can come back and visit Simon, right? No. What about me? Don't freak out, but you're gonna be deleted. Oh, no! It's okay, Simon. I'm just glad I didn't destroy your world. You are my world. Goodbye, freaks! Don't forget Bye, dude. I'm gonna be nicer to penguins from now on. Okay. Wait, what? Whoa. Before I go, there's something I have to tell you. Tell me, Betty. I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I Betty! I'm seeing remnants of Betty's program in the readouts. It's like her data left a shadow print on the circuitry. So, what was that thing you were gonna tell me? I just said that for drama. I figured it would drive you crazy, but at least you'd never stop thinking about me. Betty, I never could. Mwah! I don't see anything. These are just weird dots to me. My place is trashed and I can't remember a thing. Great dinner party, huh? Best I've ever been to. What? I don't like relaxing; I like science. BothHey, Cinnamon Bun. Hi.

Bun Bun "Dear Cinnamon Bun,I have a dog now. His name is Cinnamon Bun. Love, Bun Bun." Well, looks like your new house is done. [Throws helmet] Whoop! Jake! You wanna check out the new house? Naah, [Draws Lady Rainicorn on the dirt] don't let me interrupt you. You two have fun. [Excited] I wanna see inside! [Checks inside the house and merging with it] [Laughter] I love it! [deep voice] Great! [Fire touches [Worried] Finn! Haha, I'm okay! [Interested] Hmmmm... [Laughter and splashes] Oh! [Requests] Do the thing that I like. [Agrees and acts] [Sucking some water and squirts it upward like a sprinkler] [Giggles] [Requests] Now do the thing I like. [Agrees, acts and turns around, where his butt is facing] [Submerges, splashes and farts underwater gas bubbles for three times] Hehehe, classic. [Stretches out his left hand to Finn] Alright Finn, that's enough. [Pulls Finn out of the water] Thank you for building my new home, Finn. I'm so happy. [Eyes sparkle] You... wanna hug? Yes. Woah! Hold on "mama." [Pats the foil] Okay bro, tin foil's on. You can hug now. [Weird smile] Bye. [Whispers] Bye, Finn. [Turns around] Bye! [Loses some balance] [Giggles and waves Good Bye at Finn.] Looks like your date went pretty good buddy. Uh... I don't know, was the hug okay? Give me some tips man. Bro, you gotta let things take their natural path. Look, look [Turns right arm to 15 small stairsteps], let me explain some junk about dating. Right now, [Points left finger to first step], you're at Tier 1, which is hugging. But pretty soon, [Points left finger to second step] you'll be at Tier 2, which is smooching. Then down the road [points left finger to fifth step], you'll make it to Tier 5, where she'll let you discover all fifteen feet of her loong, beautiful stomach. Then after awhile, you'll make it to Tier 8 [points left finger to eighth step], where you touch her horn for the very first time. Very special. [Very curious] [Pops out his left arm and points left finger to fifteenth step] What about Tier 15? [Warns Finn while pointing his left finger at him] You stay away from that! Do not do Tier 15! [Terrified] Dude, I got no idea what you're talking about. [Undoes the 15 small stairsteps] Don't worry about it dude, just let things naturally move to Tier 2. Oh and um, you need a shower dude. What?! [Pops out right arm] [Rips a bit of tinfoil] [Then sniffs self] Oh gross. Do you think Flame Princess could smell me? Probably. Crup. 'Sup, guys? Princess Bubblegum?! What are you doing here? Collecting taxes, you guys weren't home. So I let myself in. Oh. I'm gonna take a shower. Princess, do not inhale! What? Why? Just don't. [Flips to the ladder and climbs up quickly] Hyap! What's that all about? Aah, he's just smelly from a day of running around with his lady-friend. [Curious and interested] Ooh, a lady-friend, do tell. Uh, I shouldn't say. It's his business. [Sits on the floor to hear better] Oh, come on, you can tell me. That's his personal biz, you gotta respect the man's p-biz. Okay, you're right, I'll respect it. Flame Princess! He's hanging out with Flame Princess! [Distraught] What?! And I don't mean to be telling stories out of school. But pretty soon, [lowers voice] they're gonna be taking it to Tier 2. No, this isn't possible. Oh, it's possible. I just never thought, Flame Princess. I-uh-I have to go. Morrow! [Picks up Princess Bubblegum] [Confused] Mmm, weird. [Climbs down the ladder] Guess who's late for their video chat. [Opens the video chat and President Porpoise appears] [Gasps] President Porpoise! [Dolphin sounds] [Opens the door quickly and runs to her bed] No, no. [Gets her diary at the back of her pillow and writes down FINN + LOVE + FLAME PRINCESS] Oh gob, I thought I'd be ready for this. Yyyaawn! [ Finn! [Shrieks like a girl] Ok Princess, you need to stop breaking in here. I have something important to tell you. About relationships. Ah, that's okay, Princess. I just hope, you'll understand. [Picks a crystal from her purse, then drops it to the floor and suddenly a holo-screen appears. Next she moves the contents of the holo-screen] Relationships [drops her purse] are like layers of sedimentary rock....... Jake, Flame Princess is waiting for me. I'm gonna bounce out. Uh, ok, [lowers voice] Tier 2 baby! Word. [Then flips out of the Tree Fort's front door] If too much frustration builds, the magma will erupt causing a catastrophic super-stratum of igneous rock to form...... What? Where am I? Jake, you're president now! Oh my glosh! [Starts dancing] Jake! [Groans for 3 times] Wake up! [Groans another and regains consciousness] Jake, where's Finn? He stepped out. Will you tell him why he can't see Flame Princess anymore? Oh, oh! [Thinking Princess Bubblegum is jealous] I see what's going on here! Great! I cannot stress how important it is that they not see each other. [Then leaves the Tree Fort] Oh man, PB is totally jealous of Flame Princess! Jump, punch, kick, kick! What's up man? Yo, dude! So what did Princess Bubblegum want? She doesn't want you see Flame Princess anymore. She's crazy jealous! [Suddenly frowns] So, you at Tier 2 yet? [Recalls] I got about five hugs, does that count? Nnoope. [Embarrassed] Uhaah.. Well, I'm still at Tier 1. I know exactly what'll get you Tier 2.... A "sappy poem." [Takes Finn to the bedroom] Say something about her "spectrum." Ee-eww! Let's see.... She's bright. She's beautiful. She makes me feel... confused, l-like something's filling up my chest, like I can't breathe, is it because she's so.. dangerous? Glob, Jake, I can't stand it! [Checks Jake] [Snoring while sleeping] Inspiration... [Then writes again, thinks, rips out another paper, and starts writing again.] Finn! [Shrieks like a girl] Whatcha doin'? Oh, uh, hi, Princess. I'm, uhh, writing something for Jake. Oh, well, speaking of Jake. Did he explain everything to you? Yyeah. And you understand? [Turns around] Yeah, I understand. Finn, sometimes you want someone and you [puts hand on Finn's left knee] want to kiss them, and be with them. But you can't, because responsibility demands sacrifice. [ I'm trying to say that you're a hero, Finn. You're my hero. So, I'm glad you understand why you can't be with Flame Princess. [Still angered, stands up for himself and Flame Princess] Grr... Bubblegum! I can't do this anymore! What? Now you like me?! Finn, what are you talking about? What am I talking about?! [Sighs and assumes] PB, I was.... geh...eh.. [Blushes] I was in love with you! Okay?! And you didn't love me back! Now I'm ready to move on, and it's like...rrmph!! You're gonna build me up all over again! Well, I'm done! I'm done. [Leaves Princess Bubblegum for herself] [Picks up a piece of crumpled paper and tries reading it, then quietly exclaims] Oh, no! Finn! Jake, where's Finn? Is he with Flame Princess? [Taps the frying pan] Back off, Bubblegum! That's his "man's biz." Is he with her?! [Shows the crumpled paper to Jake] Or not?! [ What are you..? This isn't about some [crumbles the paper] petty love triangle! Flame Princess is physically unstable! [Explains] Her elemental matrix can't handle extreme romance! Glob, if Finn tries to kiss her, she'll burn so hot, she'll melt right through the planet's crust, down through the molten core, then she'll be thrown back and forth by gravity until she burns out the world from the inside! Why do you think I had her father keep her locked up?! [Shocked and Gasps] Will you take me to them? Faster! [Blushing while reciting his poem for Flame Princess.] Your wavelengths are my weakness, your emissions are what I've been missing. [Then the poem is accidentally burnt by Flame Princess.] [Both giggle] Ahhh. No! [In pain, with serious burns around the lips] Ohhhh-uh, Flame Princess! [Crawls to the melted hole] FLAME PRINCESS! [Panting] Finn! Finn, there's no time! You have to... Are you alright? Finn! [Difficulty of handling Finn keeps increasing. He slips and covers the entire hole.] [Panting, then he hits ground. The surrounding scene color changes from red to violet.] Ohhh-tsst. Flame Princess! [In pain] It's hot! Wait, wait! Don't move. This is good! If you stay on the hole for 24.8 seconds, the reaction will be deprived of oxygen. [Hushed voice] She'll go out. [Still in pain] Geh.. What about Finn? Hey! [Struggling to breathe] What's wrong? Please, say something. [Breathes twice] Please... [breathes] I need you... [breathes] to be okay. [Takes a deep breath and gives Flame Princess air to save her.] Huh, ummm. [Gasps] [Coughs] Are you okay? I'm okay. I'm okay. [Sighs] She's stabilized. We're safe... for now. [Blushes] [Kisses a rock.] [Blushes] [Kisses the same rock, which smolders slightly.] Oh, Finn. [Coughs] [Unhappy] What? [Weird smile] Jeeeaalous? Shut up. Yeah! [Laughs and torches an iceberg] Yeah! I found another bike and more computers. What do you got? I keep finding baby shoes! WHAT THE HECK, MAN?! And they're all lefties! Sorry I'm not finding any loot. Keep it together, chubby, because I think we found enough scrap to finish building our gauntlet dock; a dock that is also a gauntlet. Aww. Building this gauntlet dock is hard, man. Hard work sucks. Don't be lazy, Jake. Huh? Incoming iceberg! Whoa! That one's huge! I got dibs! Ooo. I hope it's not baby shoes. [Gasps] It's a guy. Creepy. It's a buncha guys. You know what they remind me of? Well-dressed pickles. Stand back, Jake! I'm gonna melt 'em outta there! Full charge. Whoa, don't roast 'em, man. You gotta flambé. Ah. Perfecto. Bon appetit. Hey! Can you hear me? Hello? [Knocking on one of their heads] I don't think they made it. Hey. [Reaching for a briefcase] This one's got some kind of pack. I remember... business. Let go! Let go! Let go! We... are Business Men. Oooh... Well, I'm What kind of business do you do? Been frozen... so long, I... [The businessmen all shake their heads, as if in pain] can't remember. Can't remember! Oh. Looking for help, your business? We love work for you. Nah. Adventurers don't need any help. Yes! Help us fix that dock. Dock-ka? Yeah! Right over there. Yes. This dock-ka... could be more... efficient. No! Wait! Jake, this dock is our fun pie. We should be the ones to bake it. But they're begging for it, Finn. Just look at 'em. [Murmuring] Build dock. Build dock. Finn. These poor souls are lost without jobs. We can't ignore their plight. Uhh... [To the businessmen] Go on guys, fix it up! Woo! Well... they do seem really happy to do it. Of course, man. They said they "love work for you." [In unison] Uhh... We finish. Whoa! Told ya so. Come on! Let's try it out! [Laughing] Yeah! Woo! [Laughing] Yeah! Woo! [Panting] See? If we hire them full time, they'll be back in business and we'll be able to focus on fun stuff. Everybody wins! Maybe you're right. [To the businessmen] You hear that, guys? Maybe I'm right! Really? Job? With... ad-ven-tur-ers? Yeah, mans! Feels weird doing nothing. Relax, man. This is your day off. [From far in the distance] Help! Somebody help! Trouble, dude! Get your axe! I'll get my... wha? Adventure pack... ready for you. Hey, thanks man. I have to say, Jake. My sword is totally shiny and stinkin' sharp! Uh huh. Even my shoes feel different. Not only are they clean, I feel radder, faster, more... adequate. Cool! Help! Don't cry, Hot Dog Princess! Jake and I will fend off these battle cubes! Man. I'm getting tired. [Groan] Me too. These cubes are... frickin' resilient. Hey, business dudes! Hold off these cubes so we can catch our breath? Jake! They don't know how to fight. [Offering bottled water and orange slices] Water. Orange slices. Help rehydrate. These guys are great, right? I gotta admit... they are helping. [Surprised] Oh! I think I figured out how to defeat the battle cubes! That's 'cause you had time to rest your body and refresh your brain. [To businessmen] Ok! We'll take it from here, guys! Yeah! Good work. Grab all the cubes together! Got 'em! It worked! Wake up, Hot Dog Princess. You're free. Oh! Thank you, Finn and Jake! Especially you, Finn. [Whispering to Jake] Ugh. She smells like old hot dog water. [Whispering to Finn] I take one for team. This is awesome! You get a promotion, fella. Take one for team, too. Oh... Lost again! [Grabbing the controller] My turn. What's that? Hero vision monitor. Use satellite to tell us world problems. Oh, wow. Anything going on? Just small things. You save stress for big thing. Freakin' awesome, man. What are they doing? Takin' care of business. Jake, hit me! Mission complete. Yeah! We beat Adventure Master! Holy moly! We're adventure masters! Woo! Yes! [Tired] Ooo. I never knew being fat and lazy was so rewarding. Yeah. [pushing around Finn's gut] You're gut's so huge and moldable. Hey! Hold on a sec! [Laughs] Man, that tickles. [Impersonating Ice King's voice] I'm the Ice King, and I'll never find a bride because I'm such a tool. [Laughs] Alright, let me try. [Impersonating Princess Bubblegum's voice] I'm Princess Bubblegum and I'm a dork, because I like science! I've also got a really annoying voice that [Laughs] That's a- Hey, what'd you say? [On a hero vision monitor, running from a Swamp Giant] Ahh! Oh, my gosh! Leave me alone. All I said was "you're ugly," which is totally true. Somebody help me! Oh no! Man, I am not in the mood for saving Lumpy Space Princess. Hey, business dudes! What do you guys think? Hmm... Just one monster. We do. Right. We'll just save our strength for the big adventures, then. Ahh. Nice call, dude. Imagine how awesome the adventure's going to be when it's time for us to go out there. I'm too tired to imagine stuff, but I bet you're right. [Both grabbing a tub of ice cream and toasting with them] To being great adventurers! Oh, gosh. Help us! Huh? Jake! Did you hear that? Yeah. Let the businessmen handle it. Help! Please! I heard it again. businessmen, dude. Heeeeeelp! [Through a PA system] Woo-hoo! Woo! Jake! We messed up! The businessmen have gone bat-crazy, dude! [Still lying on the floor] Man, just let the businessmen handle it. THE BUSINESSMEN ARE THE PROBLEM, you lazy plug-hole! [Opens his eyes, surprised] Huh? [Yelling out the window] Guys! Guys, stop it! [Running up to the businessmen's robot] Stop it, guys! Stop what, boss? You're jacking up those Fuzzy Friends! But... We're being heroes. Like you, boss. We're protecting them. Collecting them in our care-sack so they cannot be hurt. It's the most efficient way to save people. But you're making them unhappy! Irrelevant! These people are in our care-sack. Their happiness is not priority. I am your boss! And you guys are all fired! Fi-red? Nooo! Alright, guys. Now I've gotta take you down... I'm kicking your care-sack, dudes! Finn? Whoa... Crud. I'm comin' buddy! Ahh. I'm so fat, dude; I don't know what to do. [Gasp] That's it! Jake! Demoralize them! What? Why? Do it, man! I have a legit plan! Ok, Alright. [To businessmen] Hey! You guys are horrible at business! Huh? They're sucking me up, dude! Now, eat that ice cream some more to become fatter, while also using your Stretchy Powers to grow huge! [lifting his head up for a second] Ok! This sucks. Yeah, dude! Keep growin'! You're breaking apart their robot! Oh no! [Attempting to grab Finn] I'm going to kill you, not-boss! Wait, man! Wait! I wanna re-hire you guys! Re-hire? Really? Yeah, mans. Woo hoo! Yay! Hip-hip hooray! Pancakes! So, wait... What'd you hire them to do? I hired them to stuff themselves in that iceberg and get outta here. [Sigh] I'm gonna miss 'em. And I'm gonna miss this gut. [Laughs] I'm gonna miss my gut too. Huh? Aww... SLAM! [ That book is above your level. What business are you into? None of your business! Talk about it over lunch? Heh, if you're buying. Hey! Hey! Fight! Ahh! it's terrible! Lumpy Space Princess! Whats wrong?! You guys! Somebody stole something from me! Something I can't live without! [starts making noises and grunting] I'll get something to calm her down. [ I've been robbed! I've been robbed! [yells] Out of the way! [ Do something! I've been- ooh! [ Oops. LSP! Who robbed you? [in normal voice] It...was...puh...pee...pete...sa...sas...as...[mumbles incoherently and falls down to the ground] I think I gave her too much. Jake. A crime has been committed. We must find the criminal. We must. [looks up] And retrieve whatever it is that was stolen from Lumpy Space Princess. [looks up] Stolen. But all we have to go on is part of a name. Pete something. [ Clues, clues, clues. [mumbles incoherently and holds up a golden key.] What's that? I can't see it. Oop, sorry. [opens mouth so there is a hole where the glass would be if he were really a magnifying glass] Aah! There's something in her hand! [picks it up] A key! A key to...what? Three zero three. Hmm. [closes his mouth so he can look at the key] Ooh, turn it around! [opens mouth again.] Ah! [the key says 'The Coolest Hotel' with a picture of said hotel.] Looks like we've got our first lead! Hmm. Find anything, Jake? [pulling out a plastic bag from inside another plastic bag] Got some bags and...wait- [pulls out another plastic bag] more bags. But no leads on Pete something. [shining flashlight on can.] Same here. BMO. [BMO pops out of Hmm. Hmm. [drawing hand turkeys on the wall] Hmm. [ Yeah man, that's definitely blood. Hmm. LSP's injuries were 100 percent emotional. So it has to belong to Pete Sa-something. BMO, take a sample and do a full blood analysis. [in a Jersey accent] The works. [in normal accent] Hey, if that guy cut himself during the robbery, he might have gone somewhere to buy a mini adhesive bandage. There's a drugstore across the street! [ Woah! And if the oozing persists, just come back [leans over] [in a slightly hushed tone] and I'll give you something a little stronger. [ Hello, citizen. Had anyone in here looking to buy some mini adhesive bandages today? A lot of people come through my store, gentlemen. You can't seriously think I'd be able to remember any one particular customer among the countless others I see on a daily basis, now, can you? I guess not. Fair dues. C'mon, Jake. [holding her finger up] Wait! Now that you mention it, there was this one guy in here earlier. Real suspicious type. Had a nosebleed. Said it was the first one he'd had in years. [As Ma'am, can you give us a name? Mmm, nope. No wait, yes I can. Pete Sassafras. Did you catch which way he was going? Of course! He said he was catching a train at 1127, Candy Kingdom Station, Platform 5. Heh. Sorry, I wish I could remember more. See anyone who might be our guy? [sighs] Nope. [Camera angle changes so we can see what I really like turnin' into cop stuff. I literally can't stop turning into cop stuff. [Scene changes into Let's book him, son. [at the man] Stop right there! What's under that skeezy trenchcoat ya- [shouts] Crook! [Finn and Jake grunt loudly.] Busted! For attempting to board a train without a ticket. Oh, guys, he's getting away! We're not criminals, man! We're working the beat, just like you! Jimmy? [licks Jake] Yup. Checks out. He tastes like police. [sighs] Sorry about that, officers, it was an honest mistake. [looking at train] Ugh. We lost him. Not yet we didn't! [Scene turns to show Ugh! It's too far ahead! We'll never catch it. If we cut through the forest, maybe we can head it off at the pass. Sweet thinkin'. Yeah! Are you Pete Sassafras? Wha-? Uh, I got a lot of names. Who's askin'? [ Who? What's that, an acronym or somethin'? Cuff 'em. Ehh, I got this. [ Alright, you listen, flatfoot. There's been some kind of crazy mistake here. I didn't do nothin'! Save it for the candy judge, Pete. Look, you can cut the act and drop the sass, Sassafras. We've got an eye-witness and your blood at the scene of the crime. You do the crime, you do the time, man! Roll the dice, you pay the price. What dice? Oh, you guys are donkers. Burgle our friend, it's the end. [morphs his hand into a giant fist] For you! I wanna see a lawyer. I'll handle this, Pete. You're upsetting my client. Just look at that face. That constitutes harassment, so give him some space. Don't worry buddy, I got this case. [in a menacing voice] Welcome to the next twenty-five years of your life. [sighs] We deserve donuts. Let's ball. [Finn and No, wait, please! You guys! Guilty! [The door closes.] Man, we didn't just crack that case, we crunched it! Crumbled it! We are awesome at being cops! [while eating a donut] No question about that. [sighs] Call me crazy, but I was thinking maybe we should actually become detectives. Like, as a job! When we were out on the streets back there, getting those leads, busting that perp, it just felt so...I don't know...right. [ [ I told you I have a problem. I can't stop! [ Oh hey, BMO. What's going on? I finished processing the blood sample. And I have the result. Nice! Yeah, good work, BMO! It's Pete Sassafras's blood, right? No. It doesn't belong to anyone because it's not blood. It's tomato sauce. Tomato sauce? Hmm... [As But how would pizza sauce end up in a hotel room? [snaps his fingers] Unless it was delivered. Pizza Sassy's! Where's the delivery guy?! Oh, you mean Petey. He's out. He's makin' deliveries. [whispering to Finn] Or maybe he's out tying up loose ends! [gasps and screams] LSP could be in danger! Danger! [Finn and Phone? Phone. [He smiles and points to a phone in the store.] [Gasping, Huh? Why? LSP could be in danger! LSP woke up and went back to her hotel room. [screaming] OH MY JAM!!! He's already here! [They both run towards the hotel, screaming and gasping.] Can I help you? [screaming] LSP! [They run, screaming down the hallway to room 303, where they here LSP yelling "Oh no!" and "What are you doing?!" Jake breaks down the door and both It was you! You did it! Help me! I was just delivering the pizzas she ordered. And now she won't let me leave. LSP, what is going on? You said he stole something from you. He did! He stole...my heart! [ Hurry up, dude! Shh! Right. Thanks! Shh. Go, go! [while walking out] Yeah, no tip, huh? That's great. That's how it is, around here. Fine. [morphing into police car] Huh, huh? Come on pal. Turns out the only case here is just another case of LSP being nutty! Hey, Jake, what's wrong? You look dumpy. How come? Is it because of that metal box? Is something sad inside? No. It's nothin'. There's lots of boxes that have nothing in them, but also, you can put something in the box, and then it won't be empty. Does that make you feel better? Ha ha. You're a charmer, Finn Human. No... it's... well... Lady Rainicorn doesn't wanna play the game Card Wars with me. I always beat 'er... so she says, "No more Card Warring." What's Card Wars? It's a fantasy card game that's super complicated and awesome, but—well... No, it's kinda stupid. Never mind. How come you never talked about it before? It sounds cool! Really? Well... I thought you'd say it was for nerds who do not know how life is outside of the nerd universe. It is, man. But I still totally wanna play it. So no more moping, okay? Thanks, Finn. Oh, hey, BMO. You wanna play, too? No. I do not play such games... with Jake. What's that mean? Ah, whatever. Let's play the game. So what kinda stakes do we play for? How about... the loser... is a dweeb, and the winner is a cool guy? Those are good stakes. Coffee ground, beetle butter, grape jelly, kimchi, and... this stuff. [It's a bottle of pink liquid that says "HAM CHUNK JUICE."] Hey! You're ruining that pop with weird taste! We drink when the game is over. Oh, gross. Now lemme explain the rules. That's basically the basics! So once we have our kingdom set up... [Floops land cards] ...it's time to start to play. FOR THE GLORY! [Finn wakes up with a dazed "Whuh?"] Hey, were you asleep?! I'll have to explain it all over again! Doesn't matter. Let's just play. But if you don't know the rules then you're gonna lose in the first couple rounds, like Lady always does! And then you'll hate the game, and then you'll hate me, and then... and then... [Scoffs] You think you're gonna win? I'm gonna crush you! Party-dance-style, dweeb! Haha! Bring it! So... how do I get my land on the map? Oh... you, uh, floop your land cards. Uh... Keep those honeys hidden, or I'll get a strategic advantage! Oh! [Holds cards closer] Hmmm... Okay, I go first. I floop the Silo of Truth! [Gasps] Hey!! Pfff, you got really lame cards. Hmm. I'll take the Cerebral Bloodstorm, though. Huh? [Jake claims the card.] Okay, now it's the battle phase. I'm attackin' your schoolhouse with my Husker Knights. [Activates Husker Knights] And I'm castin' Cerebral Bloodstorm! [Does so] So, what'll you use to defend? Uh... Can my Cool Dog and Ancient Scholar defeat your Husker Knights? [Laughs] Of course not! Hmm. Then I floop the Pig. What?! [Laughs] What? Okay... okay, first of all, you don't floop a creature to make it fight. You activate a creature. Hmm. No. It says I can floop the Pig. See? [Gasps] No... He's eating all my cornfields! My Husker Knights draw energy from corn! [His knights collapse.] And, since I'm not actually attacking, your Cerebral Bloodstorm only does damage... to your own kingdom's troops. [Big gasp] You just wiped out my entire attack!! What do you expect if all your power units come from corn? Pigs eat corn, dude. Cornfields stink. CORNFIELDS ARE AWESOME! What makes you think you know so much about Card Wars?! It's just logic! ...Your turn. Hmm... You're supposed to discard a card and pick up a new one first. Oh. Right. Look at you. You're a babe in the woods. Your beginner's luck ends this round! Hmm. [Discards a card and picks up another. He activates it.] Spirit Tower?! And the Cave of Solitude?! Now my battle phase begins. I activate my Ancient Scholar... to begin studying. [The Ancient Scholar enters the schoolhouse to study.] And I also move my Pig to the Cave of Solitude so he can take a nap. That's it? You're not attacking? I'll attack on a different turn. HA! Then the seas have aligned and the five winds waft the smell of victory to my palace doors! I cast Field of Nightmares and activate my Legion of Earlings to scare your Pig to death! My Pig's in the Cave of Solitude. Um... I cast Teleport—to move your Pig to the empty field so I can attack 'im! Uh... wouldn't Teleport only work on your own creatures? You're right. I'm gonna slay that Pig, though! How? You don't have any creatures that can touch 'im! [Jake grunts angrily.] Face it, man. I'm the cool guy. Hmm. [Gasps] You're the cool guy, huh? Well, lemme make it a little hot for you, then. [Flooping Volcano card] Heh heh heh heh... I floop the Volcano! What?! That'll destroy your kingdom too, won't it?! Hmm. Maybe. Aah!! My Pig!! [Chuckles deviously] The Pig is dead. Now I reconstitute my cornfields using the Reclaim Landscape spell! [Does it] My Husker Knights revive! And I still have my battle phase! Hiding in the Useless Swamp... the Immortal Maize Walker! I LOVE CORN! Cornfields give the Immortal Maize Walker triple damage. Uhh... I told you cornfields are awesome! Your Ancient Scholar and Cool Dog won't survive this time! Actually, my Ancient Scholar's been studying the Raise the Dead ability. So what? So, my Ancient Scholar raises the dead. [The Pig is revived.] I floop the Pig. NOOOOO! Look! My Tower's doin' a thing! HOMINY, HOMINY, HOMINY! YOU GANKED MY SPIRIT WALKER! AAAAGH!!! [Runs away from the table and angrily mutters incomprehensible words to himself] Uh... Maybe we should take a break? [Makes a strange, low noise] Your turn. Huh?! YOU PLAY! YOU PLAY! [Retracts] [To himself] Oh, zing. I do not play such games... with Jake. Sorry! I gotta use the boy-style room! [Runs away quickly] [Whispering] BMO! BMO!  BMO! Jake's acting banununununus! Oh, no! Are you winning the game of Card Wars? Yeah! That's terrible! If Jake loses the game, he gets super depressed! When I beat him, he wouldn't talk to me for a month! What?! I only played so he wouldn't be bummed! Finn, you must take a dive. Okay, I'll try. But... I'm a Card Wars super Amadeus! Play. The. Game. [Thinking] Grob. Better make this look good. [Breathes deeply] [Out loud] Alright, Jake. Prepare for my ultimo attack! Well... I've still got my Wandering Bald Man. [The Wandering Bald Man gets stuck in [Thinking] I need to get rid of my Pig so Jake can reconstitute his cornfields. [ Well, that's stupid. Just attack with the Immortal Maize Walker and get the game over with. No way! You've underestimated me and my Pig all day! [Thinking] Please lose. Please lose! Noooo! I... OHHH-HO! Ohhh, oh, yeah! Pigs can't leave mud landscapes once they're on them! Hahaha! The Pig is mine! First, I'll play Reclaim Landscape, then I cast Summon Archer Dan! [To himself] Whoa. Math. My boys! You have no creatures left. That's the game, boyee!! The five winds blow through cornfields once again! For the glory of Jakoria! Heh. You got me. [Slams Finn's face on the board] In yo' face! It's time to drink up! It looks like you are the dweeb and I'm the cool guy! [Drinks from the "COOL GUY" cup] [Finn sniffs the "DWEEB" cup and retches. No, no. I gotta take what's coming to me. [Drinks it and smiles] Hey... Not that bad! I like it! WHAT?! You want a taste? AW, IT'S GROSS! [Laughs] In your face, dweeb! [thinking] Evil is rising. In vile power, the fiend walks among us again. The Vampire King. With all my investigations into the supernatural, I should know better, but I can't help it. I'm dying to see him in person! [aloud] I probably will die if I see him in person. Hello? Yo, yo, yo, yo! Bubblegum sent me for the bucket. Dozo. [gives Jake bucket] Merci and adios. Wait! Uh... how's it going? It's good, you know? Uh, Marceline's got all her powers back. She's getting ready to give the Vampire King a big, fat whompin', uh, I hope. Um, while that's going down, do you think you could ask the V.K. to sign something for me? That would be weird. You're weird. [walks off] I dreamed about you while I was in my poison coma. I was old and withered, and you were still nice and pink. [stops doing jumping jacks] You think I'm nice? Oh, brains! I lost count. That's okay. I'm done with bat jacks. [sighs] I have this weird feeling in my tums. 'Cause you're scared of The Vampire King? No, it's not fear. I know what that feels like. So, maybe it's...love? [stomach rumbles] Oh! What is it?! [imitating trumpet] It's the herald of a new snack dawn! [pours food out of the bucket] [sniffs] Oh, yeah. I arranged a snacky-snack for the team. [eating a burger] I love you, Bonnibel. Yeah, me too, Bonnibel. [starts eating the food] Ohh! [continues eating, then finshes] Holy macaroni! Can we do this all the time? Later, we can, all the time. But, for now-now, we got to get our plan together. [eats an apple] Easy. First, we take down the V.K, kill him, destroy him, and...kill him! [continues eating the apple] I like this plan! It's got good bones! Well, the devil's in the details. Like, how do we even find him? I come to you! [materializes with his cow] Vampire King! In the flesh! Not for long, sucker! [raises a stake] Whoa! I just want to talk. Oh really! Why don't you step inside for a nice chat? [runs at the VK in the shape of a spike closet with stakes for spikes] No, thank you. [he raises his arm and levitates Jake, throwing him far away] Just hear me out, Marceline. [taking aim at the Vampire King and shooting] Hear this! [becomes visible again, revealing that PB had shot her with the stake gun] Ouch! Will you calm down and listen to- YAHHH! [ [breathing heavily] Shoot. [to Marceline, who heals the stake out of her arm] Sorry. Stay calm, and nobody gets hurt. I know what you must think of me, and you'd be right. [pulls Finn's neck closer to his mouth] My thirst for blood is an awesome force. But in these new times, I have a chance to try a different course. [sets Finn down] I think I wanna- Roll out! [somersaults away, grabbing a stake] Thorn arm! [outstretching his grass arm] ACTIVATE! [to his arm] You gonna help, or what? [throws bit of stake at Finn's face and walks up to him] Let me finish my thought. [raising his own stake up at the V.K.] Stake you! [The Vampire King grabs This is the old way. Agents of darkness and light in a tug-of-war. But now, a creature can step out of that struggle. In this age, why would I want to be the [coldly] I don't know, why would you? I wouldn't. I submit. [kneeling down, placing hands behind back] Take the vampire essence from my blood. Free me from the shackles of my station. [glances at the King, then at her stake, then runs at him] YAHHHH! [Abruptly, she stops when she sees Finn protecting him.] FINN! What the heck?! It's against my code to strike a foe who's raised his bottom to the sky. The Enchiridion explicitly states so. Dem are your rules. Dem a good rule dhough. Outta my way! Ep, ep, ep, ep, ep! Look. [points to his eyes, which are big and sad looking] Look at these babies. These pleadin' puppies. Whoops. Shoulda staked him. How many times do you wanna do this, Marceline? Our lives have magnetized. We're in a negative loop. [Marceline turns into a bat and goes after him] But we can change our outcome this time! I like the outcome where you get staked! And you become a vampire? Marceline. [she punches him] I know I was ruthless in the past. But tell me, what's the one thing you've noticed about the world, since you beat me all those hundreds of years ago? Everything repeats over and over again. No one learns anything, 'cause no one lives long enough to see the pattern, I guess. But you've lived long enough. I know. Duh. And you still think this is the right way? Fighting me? The other way's like a black hole; an unknown. So let's consult a witch- [punching him back and taking out a stake] No witches. [rips off his shirt] I'm not afraid of the unknown! [pounds chest] I have the power- [spins a pillar of water around, standing on it, as lightning flashes behind him] -to change destiny! Queen of vampires! You weigh the scales of fate. Spill my guts, or face the unknown. Either way, I will not bite. For turning you would subjugate me to the wheel of fortune. And I am a king, not a hamster. My path runs straight into the void, on a sick, flaming chariot! [strikes the water and it splashes all the way to the ground, where Jake, Finn, and PB gasp] Stake me. I will not hide. [rips off his pants as lightning strikes again] Do it, chicken! You make me sick! [goes back to the puddle of water in the cloud and splashes around and yells like a maniac.] Okay, dag! We'll take your stupid thing out! [stops splashing and yelling] My what? Your dang vamp juice, come on! Cool. [slides off cloud and back onto the ground.] Let 'er rip! Wait! Whoops. [shapeshifts back to normal] [as she and the Vampire King land] Truce, you guys. No funny business. No funny business us, or you? Him. [to Vampire King] What happened to your pants? Hold that thought! [As Finn is about to land from when he was launched, [bounces off Jake and runs over to kick the Vampire King in the groin] Finish him! Bam bam bam bam bam bam bam- Finn, you can stop. Oh, okay, now we're stopping. [to Vampire King] Sorry, dude. [in high-pitched voice] It's chill. [to Marceline] See? No funny business. [whispering] Hey, Jake. [turning around] What? [begins using a code made up of a series of blinks, tongue clicks, etc. to talk to Jake as subtitles appear on the bottom of the screen] "PB says she's gonna set her vampire sucking machine to full blast if he tries anything funny." [using same code] "What does full blast even mean?" [continuing to use code] "I guess it means he'll explode to dust." [uses one drawn-out fart to say] "Well, what do you want to eat later?" [in the same code] "Hey guys!" [simultaneously pass gas to say] "What?" [in code] "Mouth fart code is for emergencies only." [in code and giving a thumbs-up] "Sorry!" Be cool. Be like, 'How's it going, VK? I'm Peppermint B and I know all about you!' No, that sounds lame. 'Yo, V.K., sign my book, jerk!' No... [opens door] We're home! Is the lab ready? [nervously] Of course. Is he here? [gasps] [enters, holding his cow] Hey. [screaming internally] AAHHH! SAY SOMETHING; ASK HIM TO SIGN THE BOOK! [staring at the silent candy person and shrugging] Meh. [walks towards the lab] [still silently screaming to himself] DO IT, HE'S GETTING AWAY! [runs after him] Wait! Just a sec! Can you sign- [closes the VK in] Sorry. Too late. [telepathically to Peppermint Butler] Hey. Peppermint Butler. I can hear your brains. Look inside your book. [lowering goggles to protect eyes] Okay, shields down, everybody! [still looking inside book] A psychic autograph! Thank you, your darkness. [pulling lever] Here we go. His vampire essence is now completely drained. [takes off goggles] Well, let's see what we've got left. [happily] Kitty! [waving his arms around] Best makeover ever! [to Pepbut] Hey Pep. [turning around to face her] M'lady? Are you sure your peepers are all right? My inner vision is extraordinarily developed. Okay, great. 'Cause I need you to go to the secret catacombs and bury this nasty bucket of sludge in the deep-deep down. [holds up the bucket that contains all the vampire essence] Just be uber-duber careful not to drop it. Pure vampire essence this powerful could kaboom reality off its whack. Don't drop the bucket. Exactly. [hands over the bucket] [takes bucket and begins to walk away] Will do. [half-asleep, reaching for the bucket] Mm... buckie... [runs at Jake] Nooooooo! Fearlessly, Captain Root Beer Guy! One day at a time. Okay, Loafy, just a second. [Water running] Hmm? Hello? Root Beer Guy? Nope. I know. I'm sorry, honey. I'm trying, but I can't stop thinking about him. Look, we've been married two months already. I love you, baby, but isn't there an expiration date to this grieving thing? I don't think it works that way. Starchy, dear, could you feed the cat later? I've got to prep a witness tonight. Anything for my Chery Cream Soda and her sweet, little kitty cat. [Hisses] Oh! I'll win your heart someday, Loafy. We can't all be a cute, little character with a cure, little straw sticking out of our cute, little head.But take some advice from an old grave digger, huh? Maybe it's time to do something with that. Here a thought... I could bury this for you. An unmarked grave kind of thing. Just... sswt!... Toss him in there with whoever. Well, that's... that seems macabre. But sweet. I'll think about it. Okay, okay. [Smooches] See you tonight. Looks like it's gonna rain. Don't forget your umbrella, Starchy. Ooh, thanks. Maybe I'll take my hoe in case things set sloppy. Well, bye again. Bye. You two are married. Good bye, Root Beer Guy Good Morning, husband. Good morning, wife. Shaving your 'stache? Uh-huh. Aaaaahhhh! Starchy! What? What? Blazes mazes! What is going on? I saw him. He was right outside. Who? Finn? Jake? Candy person number 22? Maybe I can still catch him... Hi, sweetie. I was dead, but I came back to life. That was really something. Hmm. It's okay, baby. Oh, thank heavens. It was just another hallucina-a-tion. Honey, I'm fairly upset that you remarried. But how is ths possible? You were zapped by Darren, the ancient sleeper. Your dome was cracked. Your root beer soaked into the ground. I buried you remains in a mason jar, which is now your head. And... and... and now I'm with Starchy. I mean we're... we're legally married. You're legally dead. Not that I want to sound obsessed with legalities, but I am a lawyer. Hey, where's that little statue I got you? It said,"I wuv you," on the base of it. It was a little bear with his arms out like this. He was all, "I wuv you, I wuv you, I wuv you." No sudden moves, baby. He's got freaky zombie strength. Maybe it's up here. [Grunts] Did you hire a maid service or something while I was gone? I sure hope they didn't throw out the "I wuv you" bear. Enough! I should have put you in the ground a long time ago! Hey, I came back for her. Root Beer Guy, if that is you in there, I'm so pround of you. But this isn't fair. You endend our life together when you pulled that lever. You made the choice, and you saved the kingdom. But you lost me. Heh, Burn. Cherry Cream Soda, I still wuv you... whoa! You always wanted this wall knocked down anyway, right? [Chuckles] Ooh. Oooh! Wah! You come back with no explanation, wreck up the place, and you expect to just pick up where we left off? Get out of my house! I'm sorry.  That's funny. I can't believe you used to be married to such a freak. He isn't a freak. Or he didn't used to be. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Don't worry, honey. Don't touch me now, please. I need time to think. Look, baby. It's time to dig a hole. I thought she'd be happy to see me, but it was a disaster. I didn't know where to pick up with her, so of course I just acted like a goof. Oh, and now I'm one of the undead, I guess. Hey, man, there's absolutely nothing wrong with you. [Speaking korean] 그래, 그리고 좀비가 뜨는 거 알지? 특히 요즘들어 말이야. (Yeah, and you know zombies are popular? Especially these days.) [Sighs] She's got a point though. I was the one who wanted to be the big hero, and I got my wish. But I didn't think about her enough. I'm not even thinking about her right now. Yes, you are. I am? Run back and tell her all the stuff you've been telling us. Maybe you could pick up from a place you Haven't been yet. I don't know what that means, but it sounds very encouraging! See you guys later He didn't bite you, did he? Cherry Cream Soda! Cherry Cream Soda! I've had a revelation of some kind. No dirt-heads allowed. Uh, but I have to talk to Cherry Cream Soda. Oh, no you don't. Nuh-uh. I'm trying to be polite. Oh, dear. Hmm. Pardon me! It's on zombie. What the heck? You have met your match, freaky dirt guy! Woo-woo-woo-woo! Look, will you give me a break? Too chicken, huh? Look, I'll put the slovels down. See? Hah! This is childish. Ha! Get away from my head! Ho-ho! We have some unfinished business. Wait for me, Little Dirt Beer! Ooh is somebody afraid of old I'm afraid of killing you. Oh, boo-hoo. Don't hurt me! Ugh. Is it not possible to get away from you? I'm escorting you to your new home... Far away from my house. It's not even your house. Ha! It's practically mine. Tonight you'll sleep in a hole... The same dirty grave hole from whence you sprang! I'm not usually violent, but you pushed me. Nah. What's this? Okay, now we're talking. Poke me with a shovel now,  you mustache face. Aw. Stop it, both of you. Neither of you thought to ask me what I want. I've made a decision who I want to be with. I don't want to be with either of you. What?! You're a maniac. I can't believe I ever got that low. Mmm! And you. I don't know you anymore. Okay. Take care of yourself. I said "I don't know you," but I'd like to. Would you like to go on a date? Yee! [Clears throat] I mean, yes. This is weird, right? Well we've never actually dated before. We got married so fast. Let's take it show this time around. One date at a time.   Ice cream?  [Pats Ice Cream on the head] I don't get it. Ah, just keep watching. BMO said the second act gets crazy.  Ice cream! [Kisses the prop bird.] [Kisses the prop bird and looks to the audience.] [Looks towards the audience] Ice cream... [Pulls up some grass and throws it.] Bravo! What the stuff was that?! Come on, kids! We're going to grandma's. [Sighs.] Dinner?[Runs to Finn and Jake. Slides on their knees and puts their arms in a pleading gesture] Please can we invite him to dinner? No. But, Jake, I never ask you for anything. When did I ever ask you for anything? Yesterday. You said, [[Imitating [Crying.] You don't understand me, Jake. [Rubs two coins together and sighs.] [Pokes Morty Rogers on the shoulder.] Please come over for dinner! I love you! [Squeals.] Yeah. Dinner sounds great! [Chuckles.] Yeah! Wait. The place where you eat dinner, does the moon shine through the window at night? Sure. All right! Let's do it! Oh, ooh! And when Chips trips over the turtle, it was so funny! But also sad. It made me think about the fragility of my own life. [Looks out the window to the clouds covering the moon.] Just a little more... [Holds up rice patties and a dead fish] Hey, y'all ready for some sushi burgers? Mm, I don't eat burgers. Got any chips and ice cream? Uh..Sure. I just sculpted these buns though. [Bangs their fist on the table.] Give the man what he wants! Soo, is your name Chips and Ice cream? My name is [Nods.] I see. [Carrying four bowls of chips and ice cream.] Okay! Food's done. [Finn and BMO cheer] Let's all dig in! [Jake begins to eat the chips and ice cream.] Yes, eat it. Eat that chips and ice cream. Oh, yes sir! [Begins eating chips and ice cream.] [Looks out the window to the moon showing through the clouds and gasps.] It's time. [Takes off his turban to reveal Chips and Ice Cream.] [Looks to Ice Cream.] Ice cream ice cream. No...Flipping...Way! [Stands from his seat.] By the light of the waxing moon, which was just unveiled by the parting clouds, I command these two imps that have taken possession of my ears to transfer onto the head of the being who is directly across from me [Steps forwards and aligns his shadow with Jake's]and is currently eating chips and ice cream!  Ice cream... Huh [Touches his ears.] It worked! I'm a free bear! [Laughs hysterically,jumps out the window and leaves.] Well, now I'm a guy with these things on my head. I guess I'm just gonna roll with the punches. Uh... Don't worry, man. I'm gonna pretend they're not even there.  Ice cream! [Bangs a beat out on the table.]This is the greatest day of my liiife! Maybe if I put a towel over my head they'll go to sleep. [Grabs a towel from the wardrobe.] Huh. What's on your head? I don't even notice it. Heh. Yeah, okay. [Puts the towel over Chips and Ice Cream] [Muffled.] [Muffled.] Ice cream. [Wakes up to crying.] Huh? [Crying.]  [Wakes up and groans.] Ice cream?  [Whispering.] Ice cream? Ice cream ice cream ice cream! [Grumbles and sits up while Chips and Ice Cream continue to talk.] All right, that's enough. They're going outside. [ Nooooooo!  [Sighing.] Ice cream. [Comes outside with a small blanket.] Poor Chips and Ice Cream. [Puts the blanket on top of Chips and Ice Cream.] [Singing] Ah, ah, ah, ah ice cream. [Singing] [Sighs.] Why are you up so early? [Grabbing at some fabric.] I got to get to the farmer's market before all the choice stuff is gone. Oh. Why is BMO on your head? He is?! [Speaking into BMO's microphone.] [Speaking into BMO's microphone.]Ice cream. I'm onto something important! Quit clownin' around. [Running off Jake's head.]Okay. I was done anyhow. [Goes to sit on the Tree Fort floor and plays Chip's voice on their screen.] [Distorted] Chips chips. So, you want me to pick up any snacks? Yeah, maybe some ketchup chips? [Smacks Jake on the eye.] And...some kale [Hesitant.] chips. [Smacks Jake on the eye.] And some corn... [Whispers.] chips. [Smacks Jake on the eye.] Okay. [Puts a light blue piece of fabric on his head like a bonnet.] Later, dude. Later. [Muffled.] [Muffled.] Ice cream! [Sighs in frustration.] [Looking at two apples.] Hmm.. Nice choice! Those are two of my faves! [Peering out of the bonnet to look at the apple.] Yeah, we have chips. [Peering out of the bonnet to look at the apple.] Ice cream? Sorry. I don't have any ice cream, but I know who does. [Whistles to the Merchant to the right.] Hey, John! Yo! I gots a customer for yas. [Takes Jake's apples and says to him.]I'll bag these for ya. [Hands a tub of ice cream to another customer.] Enjoy and stay awesome. [To Jake.] Yo! I got ice creams! [Looking down at the ice cream.] Ice cream? I recommend the hamburger flavor. Also, the pizza flavor is tremendous! Do you have taco? One second! [Turns to get a tub of ice cream for the customer and hands it to them.] One taco flavored. [Taking the tub of ice cream.] You have the best! You have the best, out-of-this-world day. [To Jake.] What's your spectacular choice? [Gasps.] No. No! Stay away! You can't make me take them back! [Turns to face Morty Rogers.] Oh hey, Morty Rogers. Ice cream! [Throws his tub of ice cream and runs away screaming. Knocks over crates of food as he runs.] Tremendous. [Runs and pants. Enters his home.] No more chips. No more ice cream. [Cuts open a can of beans.] Beans. That's what regular-sized-ear folks eat. Regular old morty Rogers... [Looks at a tub of ice cream and a bag of chips. Screams.] [Groans and shuffles. Grabs a record and plays it on the record player.] Oh! I hope the record is not scratched or chipped. Chip. Ice cream. [Grabs buttons and sewing thread from a drawer. [Mimicking Chips.] Chips. [Moves to wiggle the Chips sock puppet.]  Ice creaaaam. [Mimicking Chips and Ice Cream.] Chips chips! Chip chip. Ice cream! Ice cream! Hush! Hush! Hush! [Kicks a plate of beans and grabs the sockpuppet Chips.] Noiseless, Chips! [Grabs the sockpuppet Ice Cream.] Inaudible, Ice Cream! [Tosses the Chips and Ice Cream sock puppets on the table while crying.] Nyahah! [Throws up his arms.] Aah! Quiet! [Slams his hands on the table.] I thought I could just ignore them, but I can't! Chips and Ice Cream have to go! [Continues to spread mayonnaise on his piece of bread.] Listen. Even if I could find Morty Rogers again, I don't know how to get these things to go back to him or even if they want to.  Ice cream! [Runs into the room.] I finished with my computations! As I thought, it's a real language they are speaking based on intonations! [Speaking to Chips and Ice Cream.] Chips? Chips chips chips! Ice cream? [Nods.] I know what we have to do. [Emerges from a barrel of chips and ice cream holding a mirror.] How many years did I search for a rube to take my burden? [Touches one of his ears.] What's wrong with me? You two brought me nothing but pain... [Rubs one ear gently.] And I can't stop thinking of you. But I don't want you back! [Presses the mirror to his face.] I don't want you! [Glances around.] What's that? [Looks at the mirror.] Do you hear that? [Drops the mirror.] [Starts to get out of the barrel.] It's like--Chips..Ice Cream. [Gets out of the barrel and exits his house.] I..must..I..must! [Whispering.] He's here! [Singing.] I love you, Chips and Ice Cream. I hope you never leave. No! Those are my Chips and Ice Cream! By the light of the waxing moon, which was just unveiled by the parting clouds, transfer those two imps that have taken possession of Jake's ears to the head of the being who is watching from the window! Chips and Ice Cream! BMO, it's happening! No! My Chips! And Ice Cream! [Runs outside and opens the jar.] Free! Noooo! [Peering out the Tree Fort window.]Whoa. What's going on? Chips and Ice Cream wanted to be free. But they could only be if I interrupted the transference ritual. Free? I'm sorry for keeping you dudes as my prisoners for so many years. [Crying.] But what am I gonna do without you?!  Ice cream. What?  Ice cream!  Ice cream. You're totally slow dude, speed up them gams. Auh... I'm not used, uh... to running on all fours! Oahh! Ready to admit it's harder than it looks? I'll never admit anything to you. Hey where'd you go? Heh heh heh. [falling] Whoa aoh oh! Umpf! Okay I admit it's, it's harder than I thought. Actually you did pretty good! Hey check it out! Whoa! Looks like a giant dead turtle. I think it's some kind of city of... [Moving out of her camouflage] Thieves! It's the City of Thieves! Be warned boy! All who enter the city are destined to be come thieves themselves! [laughs] Even you. I would't become a thief lady! I'm a pretty good guy. Yeah, get your glasses on grandma, this kid is pure. In fact he's about to help that little crying kid. [Penny is shown crying.] [running to Penny] Oh, whoa! Be warned! Enough lady! [to Penny] Hey little girl, are you okay? [falling back] Please, don't steal anything from me! Whoa! We wouldn't do that. We're heroes. [stretching his stomach to look like a face] We want to turn your frown all the way around. [twisting the face he made on his stomach] Ahh! [continues crying] [nudging him] Jake! I'll face the other way, but I'm gonna keep doing this. So what's wrong? Oh, it was terrible. I was trying to sell my flowers out here in the desert, when these two thieves came and stole my whole basket! Then ran into the city. The city? ...of Thieves! Oh boy. Heed my warning boy enter the city, and you'll come out a thief! Never. [takes Penny on his shoulders] I'll get this girl's flowers back- My name is I'll get Penny's flowers back, and come out of that city as pure as the driven snow. Let's go Jake! Yeah! We're gonna purify that city! Cool. Crud. My ring! [gasps along with Jake] Stop thief! Stop! My ruby! Stop, baby! Don't steal! Don't steal, Mr. Turtle! Finn, it's hopeless to try stopping a thief here. Everyone steals from each other. It's redoodoodiculous! Penny! Never say that! Redoodoodiculous? No! The whole thing you said. About hopelessness. 'Cause I'm gonna get your basket back from whoever took it. And then I'm going to [yells] beat my purity into them! And then I'm gonna beat your purity outta them. [lightly punches Finn] And then beat a sandwich into them! [grunts while throwing air punches] And then beat them to the punch! And then punch 'em! We can beat these thieves while we search for Penny's flower basket! Okay. Hey turd-le (turtle)! I'm gonna kick your butt! Also, have you seen this little girl's flower basket? You're going down, turtle! Woah! I want jets! Come back, Crossbow Guy! My crossbow! Hey, my basket! That's my basket! Don't worry, Penny. We'll get it right after I deal with this guy! [points to Crossbow Guy.] Stealing's wrong, doofus! [laughs] This is fun, Finn! My bro! My body! I'm gonna steal your flower basket, wizard! Pancake, pancake, pancake. Ow, brotha'! My glasses! My jammies! My glasses! There it goes! I will smite thee, goblin thief! You stole that basket from me! No I didn't! [Goblin Thief #3 steals the basket from Hey! [runs off after Goblin Thief #1] [to Goblin Thief #3] You there! It's time to step into the purification chamber, son! [Goblin Thief #4 steals the basket from Goblin Thief #3] Hey! [gasping for breath] How are we supposed to get that basket back if it keeps being stolen?! [grunts in frustration] Hey! We can steal a new one from that guy! [ No, Jake. We can't steal. We have to stay pure! [reluctantly] Okay. I have an idea! My mom used to tell me that there's a King of Thieves who lives in the center of the city, and everything that gets stolen from little girls ends up at his tower. Maybe we'd find my basket in his treasure chest! That's a great idea, Penny! There's one thing, though. The tower that he lives in is surrounded by a magical barrier. Which magically keeps thieves out. Have you forgotten?! We three ain't thieves! We're pure! Right, Jake? [ [tiptoeing towards Baskets & Boots and whispering] Just gotta steal these boots... Jake! Huh? [wakes up] Hey! Go away! What are you doin', man? It's the city, it's getting to me. Help me, Finn! I'm here for ya buddy. [hugs Jake] Thank you Finn, thank you. [running after Jake] Nooo! [tackles him] I won't let you become a thief! [puts something on Jake's hands] Uh, what are these? [show bells tied onto his hands] Bells. That way, I'll hear you if you try to steal again. Oh. Hmm. [shakes bells] The King of Thieves' tower is right up here. Woah. [The tower is shown surrounded by a light blue aura.] You read to pass through, Penny? I'm too afraid! Is it okay if I wait out here? Sure. C'mon, let's go, Jake! [sighs] Comin'! [ Jake, where'd you get those boots? Huh, what? What boots? [looks down] Oh, no! I stole! The city! It took advantage of me! [sighs] Jake, you're a thief now! You won't be able to get in anymore! Yes, I can. [runs up to the barrier and gets knocked back] Oh. [chuckles] [sighs] It's up to me, now. Legend says you'll find the loot in the King of Thieves' chest. Good luck, Finn! Oh, yeah, and that high window is the only entrance. Hmm. Alright, wish me luck! She already did, man. Oh, yeah. Right. [passes through the barrier and starts to climb the tower while Jake cheers him on. He reaches the window, only to find that there is a rope leading downward] Great, now I gotta climb down?! [floor starts to break] Huh? [The floor completely breaks and he falls down and screams, eventually hitting a spider-web at the bottom. He sees the remains of the King of Thieves.] The King of Thieves! [to the corpse] Sorry to trespass, I just... Uh, hello? [sees a treasure chest] The chest! In it's in his chest! Thanks! [A rat crawls out of the King's eye in his skull. You see, if you have too much earwax, you won't be able to hear anymore. [exiting the tower] I got it, guys! The chest! Gimme that! [grabs the chest from Finn] Huh? Woah, woah, woah. Easy, kid. What?! [stammering] Is you basket under all that gold? Of course it's not! I set you up to steal this chest of gold! I couldn't get past the barrier 'cause I'm a thief! But you're just a cute little girl! And, I'm a thief! Well, if this isn't yours, I'm gonna return it right now! [closes the lid and starts to walk back toward the tower and gets knocked back] Huh? [puts hand and body against barrier, to no avail] Why can't I...? Because you stole something in the city! Now you're a thief! No! [yells] No!!! What have I done?! What have I become?! You've become a thief, stupid! [runs away with chest and laughs] [looks at hands] My hands. They're all dirty. Covered in the dust of a criminal act! I'm a thief! Oh, what did I tell you, boy? This city will get you, no matter how pure you think you are! [laughs] I was right. Hey, that's enough from you, Hag! [puts feet around Hag's face and throws her away] [walks over to Finn] Finn? Don't touch me! I'm impure, man! Unfit to be a hero! Unfit to be your friend. Come on, Finn, keep it together! No, Jake. This is a one-way path, down a jacked-up road. And I gotta walk it... alone. I'm not gonna leave you alone in the city. You're my buddy. Besides, I stole these boots. These super-big style boots. So I'm just as dirty as you are, Finn. We gotta walk this filthy path together! Then we shall embrace the darkness of this wicked city and use the methods of the criminal to seek vengeance on Penny. Cowabunga! [stretches into a cape for Finn] Cowabunga, indeed. [inspecting jewel from chest] Mmm. Yes. Yeah. [Finn's shadow can be seen on the tent. A twig is heard snapping.] Wha? Is someone there?! [Finn's shadow goes away and [off-screen] It's me, Penny. The hero whose purity you stole! And I'm here to enact my revenge upon you! [Jake flies over Penny, who squeals. Hi, Penny. Finn, please don't punch my lights out! I'm just a poor, homeless baby girl. I trusted you, Penny. You made me steal. And you took my purity. You ruined me! I'm sorry, Finn. [reaches into a nearby bag] Let me give you some uh, gems, or some gold, or uh, have some [pulls out knife] knife in your neck! [ Watch out, Finn! [shoots boots at Penny, making her drop the knife and fall down] Thanks, dude. Yeah, dude. You may have soiled my purity, but I think you can still come out clean. [holds out soap] C'mon, Jake! [Jake laughs and throws water over No! No! [Bubbles fill the screen and once they disappear, Finn, Jake, and Nice work, dude. She's purified! [sparkles] I feel...clean! Like all the filth of the city and wrongdoings are gone! Thank you F and J! I haven't felt like this since I was young! You're welcome. Woah, dude! [rubs Finn, making squeaky sounds] The soap got on us, too! We're clean! Yes! [fist pounds] This good deed we did has purified us once again. We're virgin islands! [Cherubs fly from off-screen, playing a trumpet and a harp. They steal the swords from Finn, thanks for the second chance to live a pure life. And you know what that means, Penny. No more stealing! [winks] Never again. Well, I think it's time for us to get the math out of here. [jumps up and gives Finn a hug] I'm going to miss you, Finn! I'll miss you, too. [exiting the tent] G'bye! Woah, dude. Why are you naked? [Finn is shown wearing nothing but his pack and underpants.] [gasps in shock] PENNY! Haha, you're doing it wrong. Like this. [beatboxes] [blows raspberry] Shermy, this is silly as heck. Beatboxing is for babies. [robotic voice] No, it's not. I am a man. I don't know about that, but you should start thinking about your future. What about you, Princess Zip? What are your goals? [Speaks alien language] Ha! Princess Zip's got a one-track mind! Prize Ball Guardian's back! Let's get 'em! Get that boulder! Hup! Whap! Ha! Here it comes! [laughs] Boy! My knots suck! Yeah, I see you. Hey, Sherm, you see this? Nope. It looks like the Guardian scuffed something up. Ohhh! [picking it up] Whoa! It's beautiful! Let's take it home, and I'll learn about it with my brain. You and your brain! [Singing] ♪ "On a tropical island, on a tropical island..." ♪ It looks so old, Beth! Whose do you think it is... or was? There's no markings on it or anything. I think we should find the King of Ooo and ask him. What? Beth, the King of Ooo is just a myth... Come on, Beth! That's what I thought, too, but I was doing some research at the library– Nooooo! Not the library! You can't make me! Shermy, I have the book here. Already checked it out. Oh. He's supposed to have lived in a cave at the top of Mount Cragdor. Really? Uh-huh... He's supposed to have lived forever. Come on, Beth! Come on, come on, come on! Come on, Beth! Come on, come on, come on! I did it. I found him! The King of Ooo. Welcome, friends, I've been expecting you. Because of my proximity radar. Hehehe... Come on inside. Wow! King of Ooo, you must be rich! Yeah, that's me alright. I'm sure you are very thirsty after your journ...[something shatters in the room] Whoops... This place is wild. [ Please be careful with...[something snaps in the room] Sorry, sir... My big feet. Hey, Beth, look. I'm a princess, too [more things fall and break] Shermy... I-I think it's okay... [BMO leaves the scene slowly] Be careful... This stuff isn't ours. Woops. Oh... [a door cracks open and the wintery wind flows into the room] Well, goodbye! Oh, no, no... Have fun on the other side of this door. But... We came here to ask about something. No, don't worry about it. Please leav... [Beth touches [BMO takes his crown and fake beard out and picks the arm up] Do you recognize it? Yeah... It belonged to my best friend. Fred! Fred! No... Not Fred... His name was, Phil! He was an amazing hero, and he was there at the end. Do you know about The Great Gumwar? Mnm-mnm. Well, get ready to have your hair blown back! Hey, there it is again! It's close. Let me see! [Watching through binoculars] It looks like Normal Man, Betty, and... [enhancing] Maja? [trying to get the binocular] Come on! Hey, just- Let me- [grunts, sees through binocular] Maja's got smoke coming off her. You think they're with the Gumbaldians? I don't know, but they're flippin' freakin' me out. [Normal Man, Betty, and Maja disappear.] Guess we better tell PB, huh? [Sighs] Yeah, I guess. Hey man, don't even worry about all this war stuff. I know we'll find a way to fix this thing. Come on! You'll see. [Stretches, taking Finn and heading toward the Candy Kingdom.] And so the Princess was mother to her own uncle, and that made him mad. But she had friends, and he had friends, so they decided to have a bad fight - the biggest fight that Ooo had ever seen. Then it's settled. At the stroke of high noon, when the sun is at its most zenith-est, Banana Battalions three and four will initiate operation "Shut the Door", forming a pincer formation around Gumbald's exposed nether legions, isolating his rear and - Um, excuse me? Excuse me. Princess, if I may. I think I have a plan that'll put an end to all this tonight. I just need a Bowie knife, a snowmobile, a parachute,  rubber gloves, and, uh... [interrupted by Lemongrab] [Grunts] Terrible, mm! Terrible plan!... Mm! No! But, but my - My plan! Hot air balloon! Hey! Now's not the time. Unless we win this fight today, we all get to take a nice Pep-Butt-style sponge bath in Uncle Gumbald's extra-strength lobotomy sauce, understand? [Peppermint Butler, now a baby, stumbles in front of her and falls off the table.] No. Not really. Well I do, so we're doing this my way. Now- Um, PB? Finn, you're back. How goes the scouting? Um- We saw Normal Man and Betty flying around with Maja, and they were chanting. Hmm, very peculiar. Hey, maybe this is, like, a bad omen. Like, to see the King of Mars, um, up among the stars? It's like a bad omen, and you should call off the battle. I think I heard that somewhere... Low battery. Please connect to power... [Gasps] Long live Gumbaldia! Stonk! That dang Gumbald just peeped all my tactics! [Grunts, smashing the camera] He's left me no choice. The attack begins now. Stonk! That dang Gumbald just peeped all my tactics! [Video is paused] Well, that settles it then. If we know, and she knows, and we know she knows we know - which we do - then we know we have no choice. We must strike now. Ladies and gentlemen, to war! A word? All right, just make it quick. ...Please. Well, I know you're under a lot of pressure here, but I... I just wanna ask you to reconsider. I mean, I don't like to flaunt my suffering cred, but I've lived through something like this once before, and... [cut to a flashback of child I understand, Marceline, I really do. But I just can't see another way out of this. Look, I've gotta go. [walking away] Let's talk more when this is all over. Wish me luck, okay? Good luck! [to Finn] What if PB's right about this? Maybe she'll just go whup Gumbald's rear, and then things'll go back to normal. Nah, man, she's wrong. This is all wrong. Even if she wins now, this is never gonna end; I can feel it. It's like the whole world's going crazy, man, like we're living in, one, big... [turns around and checking his pack] Finn? [takes out the Nightmare Juice given by Nightmare Princess]... one big nightmare. Here we go. [Watches Huntress Wizard as a bird form flying; turns back] War! War! War! War! War! War! Banana Guard 500s, you're on! Up we go. [Ascends with a rocket, so do more [laughs inside The Cake] More bananas!? You're weird, Bubblegum! [walks back to the panel behind; to a cake person] You! Give me your lunch. Got a banana in here? [finds a lemon] Is this a banana? Hey, niece! Yes? [reads the note, reading "UN-MAKE ME", "L." Groans and then steps on some banana guards] I'm doing it! I'm soundin' the war horn! [War horn blares] Wait! What!? [The horn stops.] Dang it, Finn! PB! He sees that you're serious! Maybe he'll back down now. Please listen to me! We've been friends for a long time. [in her's view, a montage of Shoko, with her robot arm, is shown.] [frowns] Okay, Finn. We'll give him one last chance. What? [with a telescope, seeing Princess Bubblegum, Jake, and Finn, who is waving with his hat.] Come on. Here they come! Hurry this up. I want a war. Hey, Fern. Uncle Gumbald, I demand that you de-escalate your forces now. [Chuckles] Listen to yourself. You're a toddler, Bonnibel. [Gasps] SURRENDER OR DIE! No! That's my cue! What? Hya-pow! [Hops and throw the Nightmare Juice to the ground.] [Screams] They're dead! They're actually dead! And so they were dead. ...No, not dead. What is this place? Finn? Last resort! Sorry, PB, but you were acting like total nuts out there. Now you guys have to hash this out in the unconscious world. This is... a dream? Yeah, man. You can basically do anything in dreams. Sneak attack! [brings a mace into existense; Fern does too] If we destroy them here, maybe they'll die in the real world. Psst! Not if I destroy you first! No! We need love, not war! Good idea. [creates a pink bazooka] Love bazooka! Put down your weapons, or I'll bazooka you! No! Thank goodness for a singing pot beast to de-escalate the situation. Oh, this sandwich is way too much for me. Jermaine always liked splitting sandwiches. [Comes into existence, taking a bite of the sandwich.] Mmm! Thanks, bro. I'm gonna figure out how to wake myself up and take my revenge on you sleeping chumps! You're leaving me? You're on your own, kid. [Disappears in a chimney.] He's rooting into the ground. Ready, aim... No! [Shoves away the bazooka, which blasts a hole on the wall.] You're supposed to be having some kind of epiphany! [Lets go of the bazooka.] Here's my epiphany you've gone rogue on me! I'm outtie five thou! [Flies away through the hole.] Fern! [Grunts] Come on! Snap out of it, man! [More vines grows around Fern.] Aah! I don't need your help. [Swishes the Grass Sword while a green cocoon wraps him up.] Jake? Help me! I want to help you, [suddenly wearing a waiter suit] but I can't lose this job. [Snaps finger twice] Waiter! Oh, waiter! Dude... I'm going to fly around, and wreck things, until I feel better! Or until I tire myself out. Peaceful thoughts... [Turns himself into a small blue butterfly; flies towards Fern] Fern! It all looks so good. [Fern screeches at Jake and [Looking Fern trying to fight Finn; sighs] Everybody gets an evil doppelganger but me. I'll be your evil doppelganger! Jermaine, you're the best! [Laughs and hugs Jermaine.] Enough, Gumbald! [Both diving into the mouth of a nightmarish Gumball Guardian.] [To a Sandwich Person] Pinch me, I want to wake up! Gumbald! We're ending this here. So be it. If you could just calm down and be cool, it would be a great thing that there's two of us. Why don't you just fight me like a real butterfly!? We're two sides of the same coin! You'll never understand what it's like to be me. I'm TORMENTED! I'm ALSO that sometimes! Prove it, or I'll never stop fighting you. [Laughs with Jake, and then notices Finn and Fern] Oh geez, how's he gonna do that? Hmm? [Notices a Finn-shaped door appears on the wall] Finn, we'll be right back. Okay- ah! [tackled by Fern] [Holding a flask of Dum Dum Juice] Come on, little gum. Don't run away from happiness! I'm gonna fix you! No, no, no! Just ONE drop. Drip a drop, I drip a drop. Not gonna stop, till I drip a drop. Hmm? [blows a bubble containing a pea shooting taser] [Laughs] Drip, drip! [The flask is broken by Gumbald, shattered, splashing the juice over her body. She gasps.] The juice! NOOOO!... [Engulfed by a pink smoke and turned into a pink candy person; chuckles] ...Wuh-what? [picks up Princess Bubblegum's crown and puts it on] Call me... princess. What are we looking for? Mm, I can't quite picture it. But I'm pretty sure Finn buried it here. ... In the underground balloon mall. Remember how much balloon animals used to cheer Finn up? Yeah... 그래. ("Yeah.") [confused] Huh? Uh, Lady, where's Jermaine? 쉿. ("Shh.") [leads Jake to a red, hexagonal portal.] 이런 어두운 지하굴에서는 살살 걸어야 돼. ("You have to walk carefully in a dark cave like this.") Aww, sleepy puppies. Yee! [Steps back in horror] And I'm done! 걱정하지 마, 제이크! 내가 처치할게! ("Don't worry, Jake! I got this!") What? Oof! [dragged by Lady and falls down; gasps] [in a distorted voice] Your farts aren't funny, dad! NOOOOOO!!! [collapses and weeps on the ground, while his body detaches with Lady, with his rear sniffing around, digging into a rug.] Huh? Oh dang! [Finn's vault is found underground.] Is that... Finn's vault? [suddenly, a giant fog of fart erupts from his rear] Aargh! Nightmare fart! [Thinking] It's beautiful... No! Oh, why didn't I build an armature? [Grunts and struggles to reach Gumbald; thinking] I can help you, Princess! Just listen to this! [Inhales; in a childish voice] Watch me do my tiny taffy dance! [She fails to do what she intended and dances, sobbing in a smiley face] Fern, come on! I'm not fighting you. Oh, what reeks? Repressed memories! [Brings the vault from the portal. A note on it reads "THIS VAULT BELONGS TO FINN AND FERN"] My vault!? Proof! [Opens the vault.] See? this is our shared torment! Dude, I blocked this stuff out for a reason! [Speaks painfully] Well, now you know how I feel about knowing how you feel about! [Speaks painfully] Okay, okay! Just make it stop! We gotta confront them head on! Fern. This is why I brought us here. We can defeat him together. No fear. So you're the nasty grass wad that's been holding my Without me, he's got no body. So back off. [aims his rear at Finn] You sicken me. I'm me again. It feels like it's been years. He was right. I've got no body. Ah, don't worry. It's just a dream! [Screams] They're dead! They're actually dead! [They all wake up, and the Green Knight turns back to Fern for real.] Never mind! They're okay! Fern! You really are disintegrating! My bad. Bonnie, I... I'm so sorry for what I put you through for all those centuries. The Candy Kingdom was your dream, and I took it from you. Bonnie, that means so much to me. Come. From now on, we'll live in peace. [He walks forward but is tripped by Lolly. The flask of Dum Dum Juice breaks, and as he takes it out, it shatters in his face.] Drat. WHAT?! He never was the epiphany type. But I am willing to let bygones be bygones. Very well. Two Candy Kingdoms, it is! Hurray! And so, in the end, they decided not to have the big fight. Oh! So you meant, like, the end of the war. I thought you meant like the end of the world. No, no, no. That happened next. So I guess everyone's just going home, huh? Yep. We donked up for real. [faints] Jake... what am I lookin' at? Uh... we saved the day. So, maybe that big baby's here to give us presents for doing a good job? Okay, I'm not an expert, but this seems bad. You ain't kiddin', shrubs. Oh - no - ! [takes a GOLB selfie] Bonnie! What did you do?! It wasn't me! [To Bandit Princess] It's been real cool being in this rogue's gallery with you. Me and Gunter were gonna go, uh... [sees GOLB] Oh... my... [flashback to Simon reading a page about GOLB in the Enchiridion] GOLB! Look, Betty. I keep seeing reference to this mysterious entity that embodies chaos. That's great! Come on, let's make sundaes. GOLB would say ice cream is without meaning. Just empty calories devoid of purpose. Good thing he isn't here then. [Pours chocolate syrup on his sundae] His presence is felt in every crevice where chaos lurks. Imagine if we could somehow harness all that dank energy...! Hey! You want some cherries with that chocolate syrup? [Now there is too much chocolate syrup on the sundae] Oh! [Chuckles] Sure. Catch! [Throws the jar to Simon.] Have you thought about using sliced almonds for the sundaes? [Flashback ends] [Shakes his head] ...I don't know who that is! Don't let it touch you! No, I'm a loner! Peebs, this is the worst thing ever! If somebody doesn't stop this, it could be the end of Ooo! You're right, Marceline. I gotta do something! [runs and steps on a nearby rock] Banana guards! Uh, no. Obey my command! Flee for your lives! If you fight, the demon will just add you to its mass! Can we flee in a panic? Yes! FYI, Princess, I'm not going anywhere! [Comes out under Finn's hat] I'm also staying. Thanks, guys. I'm in, too. This is a war I have to fight. We all have to. Me too! I'll defend Ooo down to my last blade. [Summons the Grass Sword] Gumball guardians! Yes, mom? Stop that monster! Okay. [Stride forward and keep the demon from getting closer] Containing enemy! [The demon's chest break and some gooey content comes out.] Gross. [To The Cake] Cake, pick me up! [enters the head of The Cake] My friends! It is time to set aside past differences! We must join the fight! [But the Gumbaldian troops run away in horror.] Hmm! Forwards! [Zaps the monster with laser.] Normal Man! Come on, wake up! [Wakes up and gasps; looks around] Is that Ice King? How do we stop these guys? [King Man just runs straight to Ice King.] Come on, Jake. [Turns into a horse for Finn to ride] H-H-H-Horse! Ugh! My balance! War is the worst, dude! [Groans] Sorry, mom... [His head finally breaks.] My guardian! Ice King! Ice King! What's up? [Finn and How do I stop this! [Shoved away by King Man] What? You are the only one who can stop this! Betty's up there, trying to harness the power of GOLB! We have to snap her out of that trance and banish GOLB, or we're all doomed! If anyone can do it, it's you. Sounds great! Im'a save the world! [Flies up with King Man, Finn and Jake.] [Presses down the demon to the ground with The Cake] Enemy threat restrained. They got him! [Distracted] Awaiting orders. [Attacked by the monster; starts to glow because of the infection] Help me, mom. I'm turning nasty... Princess, we came back to help! [Captured by the Gumball Guardian] Eee! Help us, princess! Ugh! [Blasts candies to him] Evil penguins! Don't worry, guys! [Jumps off] Jake! I believe in you, Ice King! [Contains the birds with his body but soon overwhelmed] Aah! I didn't think this through!... [ So this is it. [To Lemongrab] Oh tender lad! I give you the parting gift of my lips. I find your proposal... [Groans] ...ACCEPTABLE! You're welcome. Betty! You have to stop this! Go ahead. Talk to her, IK. Who? [Sees Magic Betty] Oh, it's weird lady! Hey, lady. ...I'm diggin' your primitive dance style! No! You're supposed to stop her, not encourage her! You gotta dig deep inside and find those magical words to shake her outta that trance! Get personal and emotional! Personal? Emotional? Oh! Just like a fan-fic! No!... "I feel like nothing was real until I met you. I feel like we connect. And I really get you. If I said 'You're a beautiful girl, [echoing, now as Simon] would it upset you? The way you look tonight, silhouetted, I'll never forget it." Simon... ♪ Oh, oh, [singing in a crackling voice; back to the reality] Fionna!... Your fist has touched my heart... ♪ What... You're trying to stop me!? [Pushes Ice King away] When I'm this close to harnessing the most powerful force in the universe and finally saving you!? Yeah, I guess. ...Right, Finn? [Frigntened] Emotional super-charge! [Stands before Ice King] Finally! My time - [Explodes]  [Attacks the Gumball Guardian with flames] Burn, burn, burn! PB, get me some backup! Ugh! [Slapped away; screams and thrown to a cliff] Ugh! It's headed this way! I'll take down this beast! [Screams] Fern! [Tries to resist the demon by blasting candies] No, no, no, no, no! NO!!! [Crushed] Bonnie! Thanks. Marcy?... [Stops panting] You're okay! My armor has an emergency - [hugged by Marceline] You scared me. What? Even back when we weren't talking, I was so afraid something bad would happen to you, and I wouldn't be there to protect you. And... [inhales] I don't want to lose you again. Hey, I'm a tough gum. Nothing never happening to me, never. I know, I... Girl, you phrased that so weird. I might have a concussion. Uh-oh. [The demon starts to regenerate itself.] Owie! Simon, your crown! What... [glitches as he loses the characteristics of Don't panic, but I think Golb is digesting us. [glitches] Breaking us apart, layer by layer,  [glitches again, and becomes a normal I'll get us outta here. [Knocks the wall] [Transformed back to Simon] Betty...? [Sheds tears] It's good to see you, Simon. It's good to be seen. [Kisses Betty] Hey, Ice Simon! Use the crown before we're totally crushed! It's not working! Yah! [throws the crown to the ground] Finn, it's hopeless. You can't punch your way out of his guts. [Stretches; follows them] Okay, What's all the ruckus out there? Oh. It's up to Okay, bud. There's no reason to freak out just because the tree house is [despairing] GONE...! [Pants] Ah! BMO...? Ah no, man! Your little face! [Shushed and picked up by BMO] It's okay, Jake.

[takes off his hat, revealing his hair] I just wish I could see the treehouse one more time. Yeah dude, of course! Let's go there right now. That's okay... Just promise to plant me there. You feel ready? Whoa. Hey, Finn. [Shrieks like a girl; stops soon] Excuse me. Hi, PB. I just wanted to come say... thank you for disobeying my orders this morning. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? [kisses Finn] See you tomorrow. You're getting tall. Good night! Night, PB! That's the end. I thought this story was about the end of Ooo. ... Pretty much. But what happened to Phil and Jake after that? Or Princess Bubblegum? Eh, y'know. They kept living their lives. Thank you for visiting the King of Ooo, goodbye. The king was very polite for a king, don't you think? I wish we could find that little Fern tree, see if that story is true. The tree would be a big tree now. It's, like, a thousand years old. Oh, a big tree... Hey! I know where that tree is! C'mon, Beth! I came pretty close to biting it back there. I never would have gotten out of there without your singing. It's amazing how strong that song was. Music is powerful, man. It speaks to a primal pit in our brains. It makes anyone wanna get up and get their knees goin', gotta get 'em pumpin' pumpin' pumpin'. Boompa-boompa-boom. [Chuckles] What do you think, Music Hole? Jake's right. A good song can really wrap people up in a mood, better than any words alone could. Actually, I've been working on a new song myself. It's about a really specific feeling that's hard to describe. Would you like to hear it? Sure! Yeah! Check it out, dude. Very pretty. Lift that sword, Shermy. [He does so.] Oh, yeah! Yeeeaaah! What's for B-fast, Jake? Everything burrito! [Finn gasps and Jake! Come on! Get ready! [Sets the burrito down] Ready! Yaaaaah! Peep! So cute! Look at their little faces! Haha! Haha! We're not cute! We're evil, ...and we're here to dominate you! Get the camera, Jake! I can't! I'm paralyzed by the cuteness! BMO! BMO! BMO! BMO! What? What? What? What? BMO! Get the camera!  Enough! Now... bow down to me, Great shot, BMO! Since you won't take us seriously, we will kill you. Until then, enjoy your burrito, Jake. [Suddenly worried] Huh? My burrito! It's perfectly fine. No, Finn... They probably poisoned it! Naaaaawww... They knew my name. They knew about the burrito. Man, you're letting your brain dial turn your fear volume up. You'll see. Those Cuties are nothing but an afternoon's delight. Jake? What're you doing in my bed? [somewhat worried] Oh, nothing much. You know, just... chillin'. Wait a second... Are you still messed up about those little guys? [Beat] A little. Look, man, whaddaya say tomorrow morning we go track those little guys down and find out just what their deal is? Sound good, buddy? Yeah. Thanks, buddy. [Finn rests. Yeah. Good ol' Mom. She always knew just what to say. Yeah. Goodnight, brudda. Goodnight. [Fade to black. Suddenly, Wha? Huh? I think someone's in the house. [Finn makes a tired groaning noise as he lights a candle.] For real, man! Shh, listen. Uh... I swear, man! I really heard something. [Footsteps are heard, and I heard. [Raising his voice] Okay. Who's out there? What the—?! That's my sword! [Picks it up] What do they want with my sword, man?! [Finn makes a worried face. There is a sudden noise downstairs.] [Whispering] It came from downstairs. Alright. That's it. Where are you going? I'm gonna go man-handle those guys's banandles! [Goes downstairs] [Beat] ...What?! [He follows.] Well, they broke a window, but I don't see any of 'em. [Picks up a shard from the ground] I guess they left. [Throws it back down again] Oh, no. OH, AWWW, NO! Jake, what is it?! [Drops his sword] Awww, no! It's a dead goat, man! Its guts are all over the place! It's all chopped up and spread around and... [Looks closer] Ah, no, wait, it's just a blanket. I think I left it here this morning. Jaaaake! Fiiiinn! This is the voice of your moooom! I've come back to tell you how dumb you always aaaare! [ Get 'im, Jake! Aaah! Aaah! Jake, I got 'im! He's freakin' out, man! What do I do?! Shake 'im! What?! Shake 'im around 'til he stops! Okay. [He does so.] Rrrrrrr! [The Cutie gets tired out.] They stopped. Okay. Now tell 'im not to talk about our mom! How do you even know our mom? We've been watching you. Learning your weaknesses. What?! Why?! For tomorrow morning. When our army comes and kills you both. You think we're so cute, when actually... we're the opposite of that!! [Bites Finn's hand] Hold 'im! Oh, gross. [tosses it away] Well?! Do you believe me now, Finn?! I... I don't know what to believe anymore. Well, that's close enough. Let's start settin' up some barricades! There's gotta be a thousand of 'em! Wait. Jake, look. [Not scared anymore] These guys aren't a threat to anyone. These guys are a threat to themselves. Oh, hey, it's what's-his-face! No... My men! Quickly, men! Pick yourselves up before the enemy sees! [Finn and Jake look at each other.] Come on, now. That's it. Easy does it. [ Wanna just smash 'em all? What?! No, man, look. These guys aren't gonna quit until they win or die, ...and they're not gonna win, so what if we let 'em win, just this once? What?! And mess up my stats?! No. We'd be winning by helping them to win. That's a win! [Jake scowls at [Reluctantly] Alright. Yessss! Now, let's rally an army so we can look intimidating. Who're we gonna call? All of our friends. My army of friends! Today, we will lose this battle, but we will also win it! [They cheer.] When the enemy charges, crumble like a cookie. When you feel their puny punches, fade like a flower, and writhe in your own blood! But, but... how are we to bleed if none of this is real? With faith, m'lady... and ketchup! Ketchup is delicious and deceiving! And hey, guys... Let's keep the acting subtle. Less is more. No way. First, I'm gonna fall in love with one of those little guys, and then I'm gonna fall out of love, and then, I'm gonna totally fake-die of a fake heart attack! [Acting] "OH! MY HEART! MY HEART HURTS BECAUSE I FELL OUT OF LOVE! AND NOW I HAVE TO DIE! OOOOHHHHH!!!" Get ready, y'all. Together, we fall! Not yet, Cinnamon Bun! YAAAAH! Whoa. Oh, no! [Squirts ketchup] My blooood! [Waves the bottle at the others, covering them in ketchup. The "battle" rages on.] [Holding a Cutie] One last kiss before dying, my love. [Kisses the Cutie's face and throws the Cutie to the ground] Farewell forever. Oh, oh, my heart! Waaah! [Feigns death] [Falls over and feigns death] I'm dead. Victory... is... OURS! [The Cuties cheer.] Finally. I can do the victory dance! [Starts dancing] La! La-da! La-da-da la! La-da-da la da! [Jake begins quietly snickering.] La-la-da-la-la-la! [ BAAAHAHAHAHAHA! Ah, I'm sorry, everybody! Ah, I couldn't keep it in! Hahahaha! No... [Tastes the ketchup] This is ketchup?! [Licks some off his fur] Tastes better than blood. Or does it? Hey, Finn, you think blood tastes better than ketchup? Jake. Look. [Points at Cute King, who is walking away and crying quietly.] Aw, nuts. Cute King, wait up. [Shrinks down to Cute King's size] We wanna apologize for being fakers. We did it to protect you from yourselves. It doesn't matter now. No one will ever fear our strength. But strength isn't your strength. Adorable cuteness is! Can I use it to control others? Um... yeah, sure! Just be righteous about it. Show me where to start. Huh? Who could that be? [Opens the door and looks down] I command you to make me a sandwich! What?! No one commands the [Makes a cute pose] What about now? [Gasps then laughs] Okay. Wow, everything sucks here! Finn, look! Oh jeez, this looks pretty real. [shows The Enchiridion floating above a pit of green liquid and ice] He's got the Enchiridion! [shows Bobby trapped in ice, but part of his sword, as well as most of his head, are sticking out unfrozen] And, wait, is that Billy? Why is he so tiny? [Pointing upwards] Hey, there's our guy! [Enters with his mother, father, and baby brother trapped in ice] WOOHOO! HAHAHAHAHAHA! [moves his family away from him with ice magic] Yeah, just hang out there for a while! I love it! I feel fresh, hahahahahaha! [takes off hood and snow goggles] Well, this is the weirdest thing I've ever done. [Pulls a case out from his backpack] Round and round and round we go! Hiya! [in the same formation] Oh yeah! [partially takes off blindfold] School's out 'ya trench! Woah! [Finn, Hey, Prismo's calling! Nice! Let's go say hi. You're lucky I don't take you out, kid! [struggling to pull the knife from the wall] Quit crying baby! [touching the pickle jar] PRRRIIIIIIISSSSSMM- [A burst of light takes them to Prismo.] [falls from the wall] Oof! [sent to the Time Room] OOOOOO! TION! Thanks for responding to my call, guys! I'm in a serious pickle, and I mean the brown kind. I mean like a really smelly, brown pickle. Don't sweat it, boy! Finn and I got yo' back! [makes a fist with his hand] Who's bullying you Prismo?! Nobody's bullying me. Look, um, remember when you wished the lich never existed and you created a new wish reality that ended up totally not working out? No. Vaguely, yes. What? You don't remember making that wish! Wu-huh? I thought I explained it to you that one time. Dude, I'll catch you up. [a remote appears] Look! [A recap video shows clips from the episodes "Finn the Human" and "Jake the Dog"] After you wished the lich never existed, you accidentally created an alternate wish reality where magic doesn't really exist. Wait! [The video showing Farmworld That's you! But sort of less cool. Uh-huh, proceed. So you find an old Marceline and the crown on the body of Ice King's skeleton who was smushed under the weight of a frozen mitogenic bomb. But then the destiny gang steals your family donkey, so you use the crown to become Ice Finn and save your donkey and your family. But, the crown makes you crazy, and you ice everything up like a dumb bozo, which sets off the mitogenic bomb, which releases the spirit of the lich anyway. But then, this reality's Jake made a counter wish which supposedly fixed the problem, but as it turned out, it didn't really. Can I just say that I don't remember any of this stuff. Because technically it didn't happen to you. But, also it still happened, and that wish reality continues to exist. Is this why all of a sudden one day I was better at the flute. Oh yeah, I noticed that! Listen! Something, really bad, is about to go down. [A hologram of the Enchiridion appears above Why don't you just bloop bloop it all better? Something there is dampening my powers. I AM LOSING MY PICS OVER THIS BIZ! [whispering to Finn] His boss! Who's that? Alright, man, what do we do? [a wooden case appears in Take this, and use it to take care of the Ice Finn. Oh, wait what do you mean by take care o- Good luck guys we're all depending on you! [Finn and Jake are sent to the place where the episode started at] [now back to where the episode was before the "One hour ago" screen appeared. What is it? [ [takes off snow goggles] What's that thing now? It's like 50 bowling balls on my teen bod! Oh, check it! There's instructions. [Reads instructions] The maid will handle all Class A interdimensional Bung-ups if you follow these simple steps direct the small end of the Maid towards your massive mistake [shows Farmworld/Ice Lower it! Ledge ledge ledge! [puts down the maid on the ledge] Ok! Focus my intention. [looks at Ice Just a few more jewels before I can open the portal to a better world! My intention to heal the madness of this other self. Wait, wait, wait. I don't think that's what we're supposed to do. Prismo said take care of him. Yeah, that means make him feel better. Are you being stupid on purpose? Yeah, but dude, that is me! That's me! I heard you the first time! There's gotta be something else we can do. Bro, you heard Prismo, we don't have a choice. [inhales and exhales] Ok, but you do it! I just can't man i- it's too messed up. Alright, you're right. Shut your eyes and cover your ears! [Closes eyes and covers ears] Mamamamamamama. [exhales] A man needs a maid [shows Ice Finn]. [Exhales and wipes sweat off his face] A man... needs... a maid. A maaaaan [shows Ice Finn], needs... a... [shows [still in time room] Oh, flip! Mamamamama- hey, hey! Did you do it? Nah man! Let's just go steal the Enchiridion. Woah yeah! That way he can't open the portal and nobody gets obliterated! [shows Prismo watching from the Time Room] That should work! That's not gonna work you guys! Don't walk away from the maid! NOOOOO! [holding some ice blocks with people in them with his ice magic] It's gonna be so great in the next place, guys! It's like we're spinning, spinning, spinning into the new land! [shows Finn and Jake sneaking towards the Enchiridion] Hahahahahahahaha! Woohoo! Hahahahaha! [Finn is walking to the Enchiridion] [pulls on the Enchiridion] Sneaky fashion! [the Enchiridion is not moving, Farmworld/Ice What's this? Oh! Two more converts to my empire of frost!? Finn, I love you! Just in case we eat it fighting this guy. Oh, yeah, I love you too. Hahahahahahaha! [shoots ice fireworks] Wonderful! I thought I'd rescued all the humans! Now you can hang out here with everyone else! Gunther says we just need a few more gems. Anyway, now I'm going to freeze you! WAIT! [stretches] Huh?! Straight up magic! Are you a wizard too?! Yeah, check out my amazing wizard bod! [Farmworld/Ice Finn looks at Finn] Hey over here man, look at me! I'm a portal to another world. [shapeshifts into a portal] You can't be! I'm magic, I can do anything! Don't you believe your own eyes? [Finn is sneaking towards the Enchiridion. Farmworld/Ice Finn is distracted by Why would you be able to turn in- Why anything? Why's the sky blue, bro? That's right, just keep looking at me! Hey, what's up? I'll get you out of this, Billy! [whispering] It's [looks at Big Destiny walking in] Who's that? Enter the por- What? Big Destiny? [drops a brown bag, jewels come out] Jewels! [drools from his mouth] What's wrong with him? He looks possessed or somethi- [shows Farmworld Lich in Farmworld Jake's body, walking] ooh, boy, here we go! That's my body, dog! My friend you return! Hahahahaha! This was all his idea! Come on, that's the lich! He's evil! And he's not even trying to hide it, bro! Release! [released from the lich's mind-control] Big D's mind is back! Wooo! [running] I must escape, first try! [Farmworld/Ice Finn freezes him] [holding the Enchiridion] Uhhhh! [sees Finn] What are you doing!? [shoots ice at him] Woah! [dodges ice] Traitor! [shoots more ice] Jake, let's book it! [frozen in ice, his hands out of the ice, still holding the Enchiridion] You dirty gangsters! We're not a gang! [Farmworld Lich approaches] That's you! [sees Farmworld Lich] AAAHHH! [tries to punch Farmworld Lich by stretching his fist, but Farmworld Lich stretches to catch the fist] Sleep! [being held by the lich, falls asleep, with green in his eyes] [trying to take Enchiridion from Finn] Gimme! [takes book] Bring the book. Ok, buddy! Are we gonna save the world now? Bobby! [groans, and shoots a blue laser from his nose to the Enchiridion] Open, oh great book! [the book opens, and the jewels float to their spots] The final hole is mine! [takes the big ruby from the crown, and places it in the final spot] To put my thing in! [The book shoots a laser into the pool of green liquid] [maniacally] Hahahaha! Hahahahaha! What dimension is this? [looking at portal] All of them! That's great! Then we can live everywhere! Everywhere you will die! [nervously] Heh, what? You, your family, everyone will die. [Farmworld/Ice Finn frowns] Over and over! Mountains of broken bodies, beneath the wheel! [breathes black gas towards Jake. Jake starts to wake up] Huh, what the? [black gas goes down his throat] JAKE! Woah, what the? [the thorn from his arm wiggles] AHHHHHHHH! [the thorn chops off Farmworld Lich's hand, which falls to the ground along with Jake] [pushes the Lich's hand off of him and into the portal] Gross! You used me! Woah! I trusted you lich! [the Lich's hand travels into every universe] Mathematical! [sitting on the table, when a green portal opens above him] Huh? [the Lich's hand falls onto him] Freeze! [nothing happens] What? My power, it's gone! [Farmworld Lich jumps to attack Hang on Finn! AAAHHHHH! [panting, then pulls the ruby out from the Enchiridion. The portal is deactivated] [Farmworld Lich is trying to get out of [puts ruby back in his crown] YES! The frost! [Finn's grass arm slaps him away from the crown] [talking to his grass arm] Dude, don't kill him! [his grass arm breaks the ice he was stuck in] That's me, kinda. Other What? What's going on? Bartrum? Yeah, yeah! Your whole thing is you wanna help people, remember? We can fix all this. [Farmworld Lich is struggling to get out of him] It's like the most evil heartburn! JAAAAKE! Get out of the way! [holding the maid. Jake gets off of Farmworld Lich]. A man needs a maid, a man needs a maid, a man needs a maid! Ding! Housekeeping! [shoots the lich] AAAAAAAHHHHHH! [now a regular dog] Bark bark bark! You're Welcome! Ha, I don't know what he's saying. Let's bounce. [is sent back to time room] Prismo, wait! [to Farmworld/Ice Ok, I can try rearranging some stuff. Just a quick cut, [ D'aaawwwww! Huh, that's his family. Hey look how dumb I am in that world. Here's me. Woof woof woof! Hahahahaha! I eat stuff off the ground. I don't know, what are dogs even into these days? Hmm... Yo, man, what's going on? I found this crystal on our door step, it's pretty mysterious, I'm trying to find information about it using the holobook. Oo, that's cool, but do you know what's really cool? Tough Guy contest! [flexes bicep] Whoo-hoo! [Does a spin and poses] Tough Boys! [Stares at crystal's side] Wait man, doesn't this look like Tree Trunks' lipstick? That's impossible, Tree Trunks exploded in the scary dark forest after she ate that Crystal Gem Apple, remember? Yeah, I remember. [looking solemn.] Come on man! Tough Guy contest me! Ha! [cheers up] [Flexes his bicep] you got what it takes to rip-it?! Uh, yeah! [puts down crystal.] Then let's get it on! Yeah-yo! Hee-yah! [Holding out his arm] Do it, Finn, do it! [clenches fist.] [Pinches the skin on Jake's extended arm.] [His face wrinkles up trying to hold back a single tear. The tear is sucked back into his eye and [Quickly grabs for Finn's chest and twist.] [He begins to shriek but stops himself by biting his lip.] [A single tear tickles out of his eye and splashes onto the floor.] Noooooo! Got you, dude! I'm gonna break out! [he begins to inflate in size.] No way! [Laughs and continues to inflate] I'm breaking out of my fat! [red and inflated] I win, Finn! Finn? [He finds that Finn is beneath him and quickly deflates] Finn, Finn! Are you okay?! [he rolls Finn over.] [Turned on his back he begins to cough.] [Touches Finn's face] I was just messing with ya, dude. [Weakly] I... was just... messing with... you [poking Jake's forehead.] [He stands up and staggers to the tree's ladder.] [Still concerned] Are you okay? [Weakly and holding his stomach] Yeah, [breaths in] I'm just going to rest my muscles. [He climbs the ladder.] Oh dangit, [Walks up to them] Jake, what did you do to your brother? We were just playin' and then I got out of control! I'm sorry, dad. [Pats Jake's head] No, son, you did good. [points at him] Having no self control makes you a tough galoot, like me! [Teary eyed] But I don't want to hurt nobody! Well, that's too bad, kid, 'cause you're going to hurt everybody! [Covering his ears and wails] Noooo! [Snaps out of it and tosses cup] Whatevs', daddy! [Huffs and crosses arms.] [He continues to huff, turn, and then another huff to sit on the couch.] I'm never going to hurt anybody, ever, starting... now! [Sitting on the floor sipping coffee] [Arrives in the kitchen and yawns] 'Sup, dude? Finn, you're okay! I was afraid I mashed your potatoes too hard last night. Ha, you didn't mash my potatoes! [quietly] You didn't even make me cry silently into my pillow last night for- thirty minutes. In fact, you read to go again tough stuff?! Nope, no more, dude. What?! I never wanna lose control again, man! I'm going totally soft [body becomes blob like.] You look like a wuss! Mmm hmm. [Laughs] [Notices the crystal on the table.] Hey, the crystal is glowing a different color! [Picking it up and turning it, it begins to glow brighter causing Whoa... Chip-chap-chop, what's going on?! Uh, which one of you is Finn the Human? It depends on who's asking, are ya'll good or evil? Uh, we're good. Oh, I'm Get him! [Finn screams.] [Still sitting with his coffee] Hey, you guys, put my bro down. Jake! [being taken away.] Finn! [runs to the portal and jumps through.] Hey! Hey, man, what happened? I don't know, but I'm trapped in this crystal ball, get me out of here! Okay, I'll try to do it using 'controlled conversation' [rolls over to prison's door way.] Halt. Hey, man, I'm Beat it! [Purses lips] I wanna know why you took my buddy and I'm not going to use force to get it out of you. I'm just following orders, bub. Whose orders? Um, well, it's a secret but part of it is we're turning Finn into a crystal. Jake, you can stop these guys now! [Two guardians appear and zap the crystal ball] Ah, man! [Pounding on the prison] get me out of here! No, you'll look awesome in crystal, like us! Can't we work this out like gents? Get lost! [Kicks Jake] [Smashes into a crystal and gets a vision with his father speaking to him.] Jake, lose control, flip out on those guys! No, dad, I gotta control myself! [His body morphs thin and long as he slithers back over to the doorway] Control, control, control, con-trol. [Still surrounded by the two guardians, he is zapped again] Help! My arm! [His arm changes into crystal.] Whoa, okay okay. I'm hatching a controlled plan. Alright, man, move out of the way and let me get my friend. Nope, not doing it. Then I'll have to move you myself, [zoom in of his mouth] with my mind. [Putting his hands to his head he concentrates intensely.] You're going to hurt yourself. Stop it. [His face gradually reddens.] [He stops once a fart is let out and breaths heavily.] You're time is running out little dog. Hey, speed it up in there, guys. Okay, turn up the juice, man. Yeah, man. [They zap Finn again.] [Screaming] JAKE, HELP! Finn! [pumps up] Don't hurt my buddy! [gasps] No, [Appears to Jake again as a vision] Jake, Jake, come on punch them, Jake, punch everybody. Why not? Come on! Why not?! No, no punchies! I am in control! [covers his face and cries.] Who are you talking to? Nobody, man, don't look at me! [runs away crying.] Whoa, [chuckling] did you guys see that? [Chuckling] Yeah. Yes Don't make fun of him, he's having problems, everybody has- [he is zapped again.] [Punches a crystal and puts his head against it] Stupid-ghost-dad! I'll show him! [calmly] Okay, intimidate them with controlled attack. Hurry up, guys, I gotta drop a crystal donk. Oh, come on, I don't wanna hear that. Hey, whatever man, I ain't ashamed- whoa, what the?! [A shadow looms over him.] [Morphed his body into a tall wall like appearance] [speaking a deep voice very slowly] open up! Feel my controlled attack! Whoooomp psssh [lightly punches guardian's face] Whoooomp psssh, Oooo oooh psssh. Stop it! I'm not hurting you am I? No, [slapping hand away] you freak! Well, there's a lot more where that came from! So you best tell me why you're turning Finn into a crystal. Or what, you'll touch me? So, help me I will touch you! [Screaming] JAKE! AHH! HELP!! Finn, oh no! [Pushing Jake back] cut it out he looks good. MY BODY!! [he turns completely crystal.] [The prison pops and he falls to the ground.] Nooo! My bud!! [shrinks down.] Ah, let him in, he can't do nothing now. [Runs over the crystallized Finn] I'm sorry, Finn, I'm super lame and now...you're dead. I'm not dead, I'm just all crystal stiff. Oh. Get your hands off My lover! That voice. It sounds like- [She appears from a corridor, hovering, pale skinned and crystal-eyed.] Yes, Finn, it's me, Oh my grosh, you're alive! Oh, I'm more than alive, Finn. After I ate that Crystal Apple in the scary dark forest, I was transported to this crystal dimension where I become ruler of the crystal men. And the crystal men are all in love with me. Love you Quartzion! Quartzion, I love you! Quartzion, we love you! [bows.] Yes, yes I know, but you love... is not enough [grins evilly] [Her eyes glow and from her trunk, a beam zaps the guardians into dust, Finn and Jake gasp.] I wanted you, Finn, so you could be transformed into my sexy crystal king. Tree Trunks, you've gone bananas with crystal power! Finn, it's not sexy for a king to call his queen bananas! [she unleashes a beam of light that turns the surroundings into dust, but Jake grabs Finn and runs for cover.] Jake, you totally gotta stop her! I'll try man, but I'm still figuring out my bizz, [stretches his legs to reach her height] here I come, Tree Trunks! [lightly touches her trunk] Taste my gentle rubs! Whoa there, don't you put your junk on my trunk! [wraps Jake up.] Go, Jake, go! She's too sassy and powerful! [gets thrown at a crystal.] [His disembodied voice is heard] Jake, Jake, I brought someone here to see you, it's your brother. Jermaine?! Are you dead? Nah man, we're just dreamin' at the same time. Oh, I'm sorry about that time I beat you up. That was an accident, I knew you were just horsin' off! But dad, you said I was going to hurt everybody! Yeah, every-bod-y. I don't know, dad, that doesn't really help me. Everybody who is evil, Jake. Let me finish next time, hm, yeah? Oh, well then I'm over it then! Rarr [charges back into battle.] Jake, kick Tree Trunks in the tummy, shes probably still got that crystal gem inside her! That must be giving her all her powers! Marry me, Finn, we can snuggle through time and space and kiss each other in an alternate dimensional place. [Morphs his foot into a giant boot and kicks Tree Trunks in the stomach.] [Coughs up the Crystal Apple and returns to normal. The apple bounces off a wall, lands and opens a portal.] Oh, dear. [Busts out of his crystal body and cheers.] TT, you're back. Oh, Jake, I was behaving so inappropriately I'm so embarrassed. Oh shush, Tree Trunks, if I had a penny for every time someone went crazy hopped up on magic energy... I'd be Abraham Lincoln! Tree Trunks, you're okay! Finn! I'm okay toooo! [does a cartwheel.] Oh, Finn, I was trapped here for so long and all I could think about was you and how your so nice to me and I, and I just wanted to say... I think... you're cute and I like you. [Blushing] Okay, okay, let's go. Finn, when we get home, it's apple pie time. Ooooh!! [picks her up and jumps through the portal, she giggles.] ♪Apple pie in the oven, Tell me you can taste lovin'♪ Alright. Whaddaya wanna see next? A cheetah! A fart! A cookie! An external hard drive! Ooh, ooh! Change into Finn, but give him my body! BMO, your ideas are boring. What? Your head on my body isn't boring! It's weird! [Giggles] Alright, I'll try to turn into a cheetah farting. [Turns into a cheetah and makes a long farting sound while moving his face and tail around his body.] I can't do the spots. Sparkles on the house? LET'S SQUISH 'EM! Did you squish the sparkles? No. They're around this holo-message player. It's got a cartridge with it. Oh, snap! [Claps once] Well, plop that cartridge in the slot, playah! Yeah! Okay! [Inserts cartridge into holo-player] [Clears throat] Hello, boys. [Coughs] Dad!! If you're hearing this prerecorded hologram message, it's because I passed on, and my spirit sparkles guided you to its secret hiding place. Right now, I'm holding both of you in my hands. You're both still little squishy babies. [Finn cries and Jake chuckles. Joshua scowls at Finn who is still crying. He lets them both crawl away. Joshua has a disappointed look on his face.] I made you boys something. It's a dungeon. A proper dungeon. Full of evil monsters, traps, and magic. The whole kazoo! Whoa! Kickin'! Kickin'! Now, this next part of the message is just for you, Jake, so Finn, cover your ears. [Finn covers his hat's ears.] Jake... really, this dungeon is for Finn. I know I won't be around forever, and I wanna make something that will force Finn to toughen up. What?! Now, tell Finn to uncover his ears now. Dude, take your hands off your head. Alright, boys. Now to give you some incentive, at the end of the dungeon, I'm going to put the Family Sword. It's made out of Demon's Blood. Whoa, what the--?! Whoa, dang! Give me back my blood, Joshua! Kee Oth Rama Pancake. Waaaaah!! [Banished by Joshua's spell, he disappears in flames] Whoa!! Geez-louise! The dungeon's eighty paces west of here under a dumb-lookin' rock. And Finn, this dungeon's gonna kick your tail. I bet you won't even get past the first trial, ya whiny baby! What?? What was that about? Uh... [Makes an "I don't know" noise and shrugs] Duh... duh... du-ugh... duh... Whoo! [He reaches the floor and sees a pile of burgers and a pile of hotdogs. Jake drops down.] Whoa! Burgers and hotdogs! Yeah, yeah, YEAH! [Runs towards the food] Wait, Jake! [Stops] But... burgers and hotdogs.. Didn't you say you were hungry for burgers this morning? Yeah, so? And I said I was hungry for hotdogs? Mm-hmm, I remember. I don't think those burgers and hotdogs are burgers and hotdogs at all. Aaaahh... [Slaps Jake] DUDE!! [Notices the next cartridge on a pedestal] Look! Finn, cover up those nubs on your head. Man... again? [Does it] Alright. Hey, Jake, I wanna remind you what this dungeon's for. [Holds up baby Finn who is crying] In order for Finn to stop whining, he needs to be put through a trial that forces him to take charge of a situation. But Dad, Finn's already figured that out. He's a good kid with a kind heart. Remember, Jake, this is a prerecorded holo-message. I can't hear you if you're talking to me right now. [His ears are still covered.] I'm gonna go walk around! Okay! Jake, I need your help. You gotta call Finn a whiny baby. But— Butts are for pooping! Do it for Poppy! [Putting player in backpack] Finn! Over here! [Jake runs towards him.] Check it out, Jake. I found two ways. This way has some kinda flower trap, and that way... has that guy. None shall pass! Ugh... Let's take the flower path! [Nodding] Mmm. Wait! Why don't you wanna take my path?! Because... you're super gross, man. Oh... [Sighs] Cheer up, man. We're only tellin' you you're gross because we're your bros. Really? Yeah! Bros are real with each other, and you're gross, brother. Take a bath. Thanks, brother. Hahaha. Hahaha, no probs. [He and Jake enter the Flower Path.] Hey, what did Dad say? Um... He said he's surprised a whiny baby like you made it this far. What?! Why's Dad sayin' all that jive?? Mm... Jake, do it for Poppy! [Disappears] [Frustrated sigh] Because... you cry like a baby... Baby! Dude... you're pickin' on me, too? [Nods] [He turns and notices the fruit witches laughing.] Whoa. I don't even cry much. I only cry when it's healthy, like when people die. Partake of the fruit... [She gets some of her hair in Finn's mouth.] Pff, blech... If I didn't cry when people died, I'd have a cold butt for a heart. The fruuuuit... [Mocking Finn; feigning crying] Waaaah, I cry when people die. Waaah, I'm Finn. Partake of the fruit! [Grabs an apple] Maybe I will partake of the fruit. Dude, don't eat that!! Why not? All the people that I care about in this world are being wads. Don't you blow Poppy's cover! Whoa. [He picks up another apple] Time to go, baby. [ I'm gonna hang here. With these fruit babes. They'll be my best buds now. Rrrr... Yah! [Grabs Finn and runs] There's another cartridge. [Finn makes a long, sad fart noise.] Alright, man, Dad told me not to tell you this, but— Don't tell 'im! You're not real. [Turns the imaginary Joshua into an imaginary Lady Rainicorn which kisses But I'm tough! My whole body is a callus! [Sighs, grabs Finn and slides down a slanted wall with Finn] On this next holo-message we listen to, when Dad tells you to cover your ears, don't. [Lets go of Finn] [Falling off Jake's grip, laying on ground] Hmmph. Hey, hey! Finn! Jake! You made it past the fruit witches! Hey, did they make you cry, Finn? Huh? Huh? [Laughs] I bet they did. Alright, now cover your ears, Sue! [Jake shakes his head "No."] Jake, I'm almost done with this dungeon. I just have one last monster to fit into this pit I dug. I got him tied up in this building. It's really hard trying to fit him into this pit. He's pretty evil. Ha. [The monster's fingers extend.] You're gonna have a crazy time trying to defeat— [The monster grabs him.] WAAAAAH!! DAD! [In awe] Dad's sword! Hey, Jake, when Finn finishes this dungeon, play this tape for him... Finn! [The monster beats Finn badly.] Dude! Use your karate biz! Ugh... I— [The monster hits him again.] I can't, man. I suck. I'm a whiny baby, and I'm fat, and all those things Dad said about me! Dude... Dad loves you! Finn! If you're seeing this prerecorded holo-message, it's because you finished the dungeon that I made for you. I'm proud of you. You're gonna do great things in this world. I love you, son. Duh... Duh... I made you boys something. It's babies. Full of babies. ...the family sword. It's made out of—babies. You know I don't think you're a baby, right? Yeah. I know. That sword is sweet! Yeah! I'm stoked to slay some evil with it. Joshua! Return my blood to me, or by demon's law, I will cut off your love handles!!! [Jake begins to activate the player] Joshua, we go way back. Come on! Just give me back my blood! Kee Oth Rama Pancake. NOOOOOOO!!! [Disappears in a wall of flames] Man... Dad was cool. Yeah. Yo BMO, you done chargin' up that phone or what? Almost... finished... [The camera beeps that the battery is full and [Takes the phone] Thanks, BMO. Alright, man. We're gonna figure this out... right... now! [Flips phone open. The phone loads and the video begins to play.] Yo yo yo yo, check it! This is Whaddup camera phone! Marceline! [Finn walks over to her] You guys wanna come party in the Nightosphere with me? I'm visiting with my dad and it's craaaazy boring. Whoa, wait a minute Marceline. Last time I saw your dad, [The camera is pointed towards Jake's feet as he walks over to them] I sliced open his soul sack. [Jake points the camera to Oh no, he's totally chill now. Okay, but I'm keepin' an eye out for your old man in case he pulls any [Puts fingers around eyes] sneak attacks. Don't be a wiener dog. Jake, you coming? [Turns camera over to him] Whoo! Yeah, baby! Alright. So, this is the Nightosphere, I guess. [Puts head in front of the camera.] It looks banay-nays. [He turns around] Marceline says they got tons of crazy ways out here. [Moves out of the way and Finn and Marceline are seen inside a cave. Finn is holding a tambourine and Marceline is playing the banjo. There you are, Marceline. [Jake pans out and shows Hunson in his monster form. Finn and Marceline stop playing their instruments.] Huh? [Screams at the camera and Jake screams. He stops once he sees who it is.] Oh. Hello, dog. Hello, Finn. [Camera turns to Finn] Stay away from me, old man! [Points at him and shakes tambourine] Heheheh, nice one. [Shrinks down and turns into his non-monster state] Now Finn, come on, there's no bad blood here! [Moves around awkwardly] Come here, let's bury the hatchet! [Hugs Finn] See how I'm not killing you? [Groans] Dad, stop! [Puts Finn under his arm] Alright, I don't want to embarrass my little girl. [Puts Finn down] So young lady, have you thought about my offer? [Walks over] What offer, Marceline's dad? [Chuckles] I want Marceline to take over the Nightosphere! Finally join the family business! Business? Dad, what do you even do? Oh! [Chuckles] Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on... [Backs up and beckons them over, the camera points towards Jake's feet as he walks over and he scratches himself. The camera points back to Eh, I just don't see my self doing this biz'. [Raises arms] Okay. But I know you'll come around eventually. Or maybe you won't! I don't know. You're an independent woman! [He begins to make his soul-sucking face and Jake backs away, but he is just yawning.] Well, I'm gonna take a nappy. [Begins to walk away but remembers something] Oh! I almost forgot! [Takes off the Nightosphere amulet and it sucks his suit into it, he is now wearing underpants and an undershirt.] Dad! Whoops! Hahaha! [Camera zooms in as he hands the amulet to Marceline] You should put this amulet on. It'll grant you wishes for, like, ponies. Or whatever kids like. Dad, I'm a thousand years old. Ha! Yes you are, sweetie. [Rubs Marceline's hair, leaving it messy] Daddy's little monster! [Walks away] [Puts amulet in her pocket] Look, let's play something, okay? Okay! [Starts to float around and play the banjo as Finn plays the tambourine] I know you just wanna give your little girl the world, but Daddy I'm not just your little girl. I've got my own life, I've got my own plans, I hope you understand and like the way that I am because I want your respect and I want to be here. But I don't wanna rule the Nightosphere. [Lands in front of the camera and sighs. She takes out the amulet.] Psssh. Whatever, Dad. [Puts the amulet on. A suit comes out of it and wraps itself around her. The phone is dropped and tentacles are seen. The phone is picked up and Jake, grab the amulet! [Marceline punches him into Jake] Ow, my hippocampus! Well... that explains how we got amnesia-ed. [Pulls out banana] But what about banana? Hey man, there's another video! We got mad prison overcrowding down here, fellas. [Throws Finn onto the bananas] So I gotta put you in the cage with the stuff. Sorry about that. But, you know, not really. [The camera zooms in on him as he slams the cage door. He starts to burp.] Aw, my stomach! [Cocks head to the side and bananas come out of both ears.] That amulet's controlling Marceline! We have to go back and help her! [Runs to the freezer and grabs bug milk] We're gonna get back using that one portal spell we know! [Draws a PHIL FACE on the wall and throws the bug milk at it] Maloso vobiscum et cum spiritum! [The portal opens] [Raises arm] Whoa, dude! [Points to Finn] She told us never to come back! Oh yeah. Oh! [Climbs up the ladder that leads upstairs and Jake follows. He pulls out his pajamas] Jake! Can you turn into a gross demon? Mhmm. [Does so. Finn, now, has his outer clothes off. He is now in his tight-whitey underpants. Now, he is putting on his pajamas.] Grosser! [Does so and growls.] What's your disguise? [Finished cutting out his mask] Paper plate mask, yo! Nice! Let's go! [Him and Jake jump through the portal and land behind many large lines of demons.] Who's next? Who's next? [A demon steps forward] Uh... me, my lord "Aberdeer." What do you desire, cowering spec? Pain? Pleasure? Or... weird punishment? Uh... pleasure. No, weird punishment! [Creates a cloud and a green laser shoots out and zaps him. Bananas begin to come out of his mouth as he runs away.] [To a big demon] And what do you desire? P, P, or WP? I... pain? Okay. [Zaps the left side of his body off.] Aw. Come on, come on, next! Uh... I'm just gonna go. You sure, dude? Don't you want abs? Yeah, gimme abs! [His face is turned into abs and Marceline laughs evilly.] I think we can charge up there and rip the amulet off her neck. [Amulet gleams] Hey! What're you guys doin'?! You can't run up to the front of the line! These good people have been waiting forever! Shame on you both! Everybody, shame them! [The demons in line boo them] Boo, sir! I "boo" what you're doing! Step back! [Taps Jake. Finn and Jake begin to walk back.] Back! [Pokes Finn and Jake] You will not cut the line! [Pokes Finn with cup] Again! [Continues to poke] You stay back here! And wait your turn like the rest of us! [Pinches them both in the side] Under... stand?! Yeah, okay, okay! I'll be watching you! [Walks back to spot] Sorry dude, you got outta line. I- Dang it! [Runs off] Who are you? Ahh! Don't kill us Marceline! It's us! Finn and [Pulls up his mask to reveal who he is.] Your friends, remember? Eh. [Lifts them to her mouth and is about to eat them. She laughs evilly.] Oh Grod! Run! [Marceline stomps next to them. They run into a crevice and end up in a kitchen. They look at Marceline through the kitchen window.] Marceline... What are you doing? Just grabbing a midnight snack. [Closes fridge] It's Marceline! That's her out there! I know! [Puts sandwich on table] Isn't it fantastic? [Slams hand on table] No! We have to save 'er! [Puts mustard on his sandwich] Save her? From the amulet! But this is what I've always wanted! My girl, following in her daddy's footsteps. But that's not what she wants! That's balderdash, baby. The wearer of the amulet is filled with chaotic evil! Which is how I grew up. So... [Takes a bite out of his sandwich.] Maybe we can get these dudes to help us! [Demons murmur and one sighs heavily.] These guys won't help you. They're all complacent sheeple. [Begins to do a little beatboxing.] Wait, that's it! We're gonna freestyle a political rap to get these guys to rise out of their systemized demon apathy. [Uncertain] Okay... [Begins to beatbox] I never thought of it that way before! The system is broke, yo! Marceline! [Pulls her out of the substance.] Aw, sick! [Spots the portal leading back to the treehouse.] Jake! The tree house! Ahhhh! I'm too freaked out to move, Finn! These demons are nibbling my legs! [Pans down to show many demons biting and crawling on [Looks at Marceline and the amulet.] Jake! Take her! [Tosses Marceline to Jake and falls into the demons.] No, Finn! You'll be filled with chaotic evil! Marceline... [Peers through the portal] No one... [Reaches his hand through the portal] leaves the Nightosphere! Marceline! Um, I wonder what happened to him! Kids these days... am I right? Dude... seriously. Dad, you tricked me. [Hunson looks at her innocently] Dad, that sucks! I know, I'm sorry. But I thought you'd want to, want to make your old man proud and you know... take over the Nightosphere. Yeah, I want you to be proud. I want you to be proud of me! No, I didn't mean... Baby, of course I'm proud of you. Dad... And your friends? They're alright! That political rap? [Raises thumb] Pretty great! Okay, okay, I gotta go now, Dad. [Closes the portal.] Woof. What a nightmare. Man, Finn, my dad actually likes you. I don't wanna hang out with you anymore. [Finn is lying on the floor exhausted, sweating and is trying hard to breathe.] Finn? [hitting the ground with its skateboard] Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Sick! Sick! So sick! Dying! Check it out. I got snacks for while we wait. For Marcy, red lick-rish. Thanks. And for BMO... [tosses BMO pine tree car freshener] [gasps] [puts it on] Fresh boys! So, Finn... [slurps red from lick-rish] What are we waiting here for? What? Dude, it's Super Porp Day. Yeah. Don't you know about Super Porp Day? Wait. "Super Porp"... like in the old commercials? Uh, let's see, like, ♪Super Porp, it hits the spot, messes up your train of thought.

[laughs] Okay. [Runs up to Finn] FINN! [Chunters] HAVE DINNER WITH ME! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! FINN! [Keeps saying please until Finn responds.] Sure, man. Yeah. Sure, sometime. [Cries from happiness] How about... EVERY NIGHT! THIS WEEK! Well, maybe one night. [Clears tears and stops crying] C'mon, man! Every night! No, man! You get out of here! [Punches Randy in the face] BOOM! Hey, y'all! Don't fight! [Whispers to Finn] We should get out of here, Finn. I think someone called the heat. [Shouts] HAVE DINNER WITH ME! HAVE DINNER! I WANT DINNER! FINN! Sucks! [Runs up to Finn] Finn, can't go outside today? I guess I could. I just don't wanna deal with those guys right now. Ooooohhhhhh.... Deal with me! [Goes and puts on a robber outfit] Let's play, [Excited tone] Cops and Robbers! [In a thief's voice] Give me your bank account! Bang! Bang! [Trips over] Reach for the roof and give me all your gold bricks. [Playing along] Ah, okay, okay, don't hurt me! Don't worry, Finn. [Takes off the mask] It's only me, [Chuckles] Hmm.... [Crying] Your beauty's destroyed! Hot job! BMO, how do I look? [X eyes] Like the devil! Whoa! Intruder! Finn! There's an intruder in here! No! [Takes his mustache off] It's me! It's Ohhhhhh. I'll dress up like this so no one bothers me about being Do you think that'll goin' to do the trick? I dunno! [Jumps out of the treehouse] Is that Finn? Hello! Ahem, hello, hello, helloo...... ahhhhhHHH [His voice scales through several autotuned octaves] [Davey's voice] Hello! I'm Davey! Oh, I thought it was Finn on account of he's wearing Finn's exact clothes. [running through the Candy Kingdom] Hi! I'm Ah, so what? You wanna have dinner with me? Go away, weirdo. Haha! [Runs up to the bike store and then runs to the end of the street. He turns around and runs back. He grabs 3 coins out of the fountain. He then walks up to Cinnamon Bun who is dancing. Then he goes and sits on a bench and starts eating a coco bird] Hey! You've gotta pay for those, man. I'm trying to run a business here! [He walks up to the vender and hands him the bird.] I gotta find a job! [Runs to the fountain and tosses the three coins back in it. He enters the broom store] I need a job! Can you sweep a broom? You betcha! [He grabs the broom and sweeps the small brooms] Jeez louise! Quittin' time already? Sure is, Davey. Take 'er easy, boss. Goodnight, Davey. [Takes off his mustache] Man, today was awesome. Just normal, y'know? Just like a normal day. No drama, or any of that. Just super normal. Man it was great. [While lying in his bed] That's cool. Goodnight, Finn. [Puts on his mustache] I'm Davey. Haha! Yeah. I'm [Wakes up] Hey, Finn, you wanna have dinner instead of breakfast today? Finn? [Wiggles his ears] That must be him. [Gets up and goes to the door] I MADE YOU DINNER, FINN! WHERE WERE YOU?! [Opens the front door. Walks up to Davey] Uhh.... What's going on? Oh, heya, mister, thanks for putting me up last night. I'm just chopping some wood so's I can build a little log cabin to live in. [Walks up to the scene and grabs the chopped wood] Hey, I'm Randy, wanna get dinner tonight? Nah, I'm busy. I like to wonder at night. Finn what's going on? [Takes Jake to the other side of the half-built cabin. So he can talk to him in private] You gotta start calling me [Large-eyed] Daaaaaaaaaavvvveeeeeeyyyyyy!!! Oh, no! Have you lost your teacups, man? Mister, I don't know nothing about that. I'm just a working joe... trying to stake my claim... under the sun... and look out on the beautiful green fields called... life! Uhhhhhhhh........ Hey, Davey, where do you want these logs? Oh, just attach 'em to the cabin. Like how it should be. So it looks like a cabin. We're gonna build a right wall and front wall. Ummmmm- How about the roof? Maybe, maybe. I've been holding these. They look good. How do you put good looking wood on a cabin? Gotta figure a way to get Finn to act normal. [Then he sees BMO running in circles dressed as a robber] Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pewwww..... Ah! Give me the wallet! Or feel my claw! The wallet! Watch out! A robber! I'll cut you! I mean, rob you! [Takes randy as a hostage] Oh, no! I'm a robber and I'm gonna rob this guy's life! And there's nobody who can stop me. Unless there's a hero around here. [In a suggestive tone] Like there's someone here who is actually a hero in disguise. They can probably stop me. [Runs up to Davey and whispers] C'mon, Finn. Be a hero. What? What are we talking about? Butt out, Randy! [While being pulled back] Uhhhhhhhhhhhh......... [Whispers.] Yes, Finn. Put on your awesome hat and beat me up. What? I'm not talking to you, Randy! [Comes out of the cabin] I called the police. Wait, what? Guys, it's not what it looks like! That guy isn't really named Davey. It's Finn! He brainwashed himself to become Davey and I was just trying to inspire him to go back to being Finn. Yeah, yeah. We've heard that before. C'mon robber! [Shouts to Davey.] Finn, don't let the dragon drag on, man. Don't let the dragon drag on! [In Finn's voice] Don't let the dragon........ Jake! [While drinking his soda and sitting on the rocking chair] Well that was pretty unusual, wasn't it, Davey? Get outta here Randy! [In an exasperated tone and angry expression] Geeeet ouuuuut! [Hits a glass against the wall] [Takes off his mustache and starts talking to it] No more But you love being Davey. I do love being Davey, but being Davey caused Jake to get arrested. But remember that time when Davey sat in the park and saw some people walking around? Yeah, that was nice. And remember that time when Davey swept the floors? [Chuckles] Yeah, that was great, too. But- Do you really wanna go back to being a famous hero? Why not just be Davey? A simple man... with simple goals and simple problems. You can just blend in and live the simple life. Yeah.... Blend in. Y'know, maybe I'll be Davey just one more time! [Puts the mustache on] One more time! C'mon, man! That last game wasn't fair. How about Who can hold up their hand the longest? Okay, this game breaks the tie. Okay. Last game. Last game. Hey, fellas. How's tricks? Hm? Oh, hey Davey. [Goes next to Banana Guard #2 and whispers to himself] Ah! Keys! [Touches the key with his broom] Hm? [Starts shivering] What's going on? Ah. Would you care for a body sweep? Umm... yeah... sure. I do feel kinda dirty. Whew! You sure know how to party, Davey! [The guards are struggling to hold their arms up] [Knocks the keys into his pocket with the broom] [Cheers because he's winning] Yes yes yes! No no no! [Walks up to Jake's prison while the banana guards are distracted. He opens Jake's prison door open with the key] Davey?! No, it's me, [ Finn! [Walks up to Finn] [Comes to Jake's prison] Here's your meal, criminal. We feed our criminals. [Realizes the prisoner is free. Drops the meal] Hey, stop! [Puts Jake's robber clothes on a candy horse and sticks his mustache to the back of the horse. He takes his hat out and puts it on, then waves to the mustache] Goodbye, Davey. Goodbye, Finn. Hey, there they go! Yeah, there goes Davey and the criminal. Good luck catching those guys! [Shouts out to Finn] Thanks! [In Finn's pocket] Glad to have you back, buddy. Word. [Sips tea] Ah fudge! What time is it? I gotta go to Veggie Village for the Annual Technology Fair. Will y’all watch my Princess Plant for me? [Hands Finn a flower with a green stem and white petals] I usually hire a sitter but- Ehn! Of course, Princess! Awesome! Thank you, Finn. I will be back on the Morrow. SCREEEEEEEE! You’re in good hands, Princess Plant. And then the monster got punched in the head and the princess was safe. And everyone was happy! [Gasps and screams] Time to lay down beautiful buddy. Yeah. Time to make sleepies! Ahhh. We killed it, man! I know! Okay. [Grabs Jake] All we gotta do, is go to the Land of the Dead and reclaim the flower’s soul from death before Bubblegum returns. Okay! Excuse me, but did you all say Land of the Dead? Oh, what?! Oh, uh… yeah. I can take you. Really? Certainly, Finn. [Walks into corner of the room] For a small price. Which we can discuss later! Take my hands, gentlemen! [Raises arms.] Stare into where the two walls meet. Now slowly, cross your eyes. [Crosses eyes] Do it, fools! The portal opens! Say ‘hi’ to Death for me if you see him! He lives in a castle made of light! Uh… okay. Thanks Peppermint Butler. [Him and Jake wave goodbye.] And don’t drink the- [The portal closes] water. Whoa man, who knew Peppermint Butler was so- [Clings to Finn as they both scream.] So… um… you wanna… [Stretches out a kangaroo pouch] hop in my paunch and I’ll stretch us down? Uh… Oh look, an escalator! [To skeleton] Hey, dude. That must be the main entrance or some biz! Let’s go! Holy schmow! [To a skeleton with spear in it’s throat] Welcome to the Underworld. Cause of death? Uh… Spear in the neck. You may enter. Yay! [Runs inside] How did you die? Uh… [Thinks of something to say] Because we’re awesome! [They high five] Whoo! Ha ha! Ha ha! Hmm… Step out of line. [Points to the side] Awh dingle! Wait up, dude! Follow me, and do as I do. [The two begin to slowly side-step to the entrance] [Points to them] Hey! I said no! Hey! Hey!! Ha ha, we’re in! Come on, man! [Peers into the entrance] Man… Yes! Yes! Where do we go now, dude? [Points to the top of a hill] Up there! Oooooo! Death’s castle is pretty, dude. Let’s go! [The two jump down and do a little battle cry.] Hey! What’s up, fellas! Hi. Lester. [Grabs Finn’s arm.] Oh man, flesh! Haven’t seen this stuff in forever! [Caresses Finn’s arm] So warm and gushy and softy! [Shakes Finn’s arm up and down.] Look at all that flesh jigglin'! Hey! If you love flesh so much, then watch this! [Stretches so he looks like he is melting onto the ground.] Whoo! You don’t know what you’re doing to me, guy! Fellas get over here! Flesh! [Whispers to Jake] This is weird, man. Don’t worry! They just think we’re cool! Hmm… Do you guys think we’re cool? No. We’re gonna rip that flesh off you! And eat it! It’s bone-kicking time! [Punches the heads off skeletons but they get up and put them back on.] [Laughs.] Oh shoot! Get- [Tries to fight back with a bone, but the skeletons swarm him and begin to bite him.] Jake! There’s too many! [Coughs, skeletons are biting him as well.] They’re tryin’ to peel me! [Stretches largely and knocks a bunch of skeletons off of him.] I… am not… a banana! [Grabs Finn and runs away. He sees a hole.] Hole! [Puts Finn in the hole.] It’s not a hole, Jake! It’s just a divot! Sorry! [Jumps into hole and covers rocky with it.] Dude, shrink down! Oh! Sorry. I don’t like the underworld too much. I don’t know. Wouldn’t be so bad if there weren’t folks trying to eat our skin. I wonder how Princess Bubblegum is doing. So! Who here invented this thing? I’m glad she’s not coming back ‘till tomorrow. No she said she’s coming back "on the Morrow." Yeah, on the ‘morrow. That means tomorrow. No man, the Morrow is her bird! Come again? It’s her bird! That thing is crazy fast! It’ll only take like twenty minutes to get back once that conference is over. [Camera pans on a shocked Finn.] Are you listening, man? [Camera pans on We gotta go! [Lifts up rock and peers out.] Coast is clear! Halt! [Finn & Jake freeze in place.] Hey! [Taps a skeleton named Halt’s shoulder] Hey Halt! Why you got your eyes closed, Halt? I’m trying to picture in my mind’s eye where the fleshies are hiding. Ooh! You’re a smart guy, Halt! [Grabs Jake’s arm] Wait, Jake! Do you hear somethin’? Come on! [They crawl to the edge of the bridge and peak over.] [Murmuring] I didn’t see them… They were here, and now they’re gone!... More skeletons! We’ve gotta be really, really quiet! Get em! Jake! I thought it would be funny! Ahh! [Points] Look! There’s Death’s castle! [Looks around] I don’t see anyone. I guess you double-killed them with that avalanche. Heh, awesome! Now we just gotta cross that river! River! [They walk down the stairs towards the river.] Man, I’m so thirsty! My mouth’s still all dusty! Yes… [Finn screams.] Drink the water… Whoa, okay Jake, don’t drink the water! Come one! I’m so thirsty! Dude! That skull wants you to drink the water! It’s bad water! Don’t drink the water! See? That means good right? [Cannon-balls into the river.] Jake… Jake? Why you makin’ stupid face? Who’s Dang it, I knew that water was junk! Tricked again by the River of Forgetfulness! Jake! Get out of that water right now! Hey! I don’t know who you are, mister, but I don’t like your attitude! Help! Somebody! Farewell, everyone! [Vegetables do not respond.] Okay… Morrow! Back to the Candy Kingdom! Help! Somebody help me! Stranger danger! Hey! Hey! I see you! Jake! Your head! [Peeks out from behind tree] Huh? [To Death] Who are you? Who are you? I don’t know, man! Who are you? What do you mean? You’re in my castle! [Finn eavesdrops Jake and Well, I didn’t know! Dang it, Jake. You must leave this place. Now! [Jumps out from behind tree and begins to talk in a ghost-like voice] Death! We’re not leaving until our plant’s soul! And Jake’s memory! Another one. Be gone, mortal! No! I promised Princess Bubblegum! [Attempts to kick Death but phases right through him and falls on the ground.] Oof! Oww… What happened? You can’t kick me because your brain is stupid! Your brain is stupid! Hehehehehehe, this kid’s pretty funny! [Sighs] Alright. [Drops rake and walks over to stage with wall full of musical instruments.] Pick an instrument. Huh? [Sits down at a drum set with two base drums and a microphone.] To get stuff from me, you have to beat me in a musical battle. But Jake’s the musical one! And he’s got poo brain! [Coldly] I don’t care. I gotta find what I can really play! Oh glob, man! [Begins to breath heavily] Oh! Here we go! [Picks up sleigh bells from the instrument wall.] Sleigh bells! YA WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW! So the contest begins! [Walks over next to Finn] Hey, alright, so... who do you think won? Oh, man! Skeleton guy by a landslide! He was like "Rughhh," he was like [Makes exploding noise]. Dude! What? Skeleton guy was awesome! You want me to lie? Yes! [Throws sleigh bells away. Death points at I’m going to kill you now. No! I still have to rescue stuff! [Walks towards Finn with red eyes] Those are the rules in the Land of the Dead. Lose a music battle, lose your life. [Eyes begin to flame.] Oh wait, wait, wait! Before I die, I’m honor-bound to tell you... Peppermint Butler says hi. [Suddenly releases Finn, surprised] What? You know Peppermint Butler?! Yeah! Heh heh heh! Yo, you guys can have whatever you want! [Walks over to Jake.] Jake, stand up! That’s me, right? [Stands up] Yes. [Goes very close to Jake’s face] What’re you doin’? What’re you doing?! Kiss of death, baby. You got your memory back. Awh, gross! I wish I didn’t! Now I shall return the soul of this. [Raises hat, which has the Princess Plant underneath it.] Yeah! The Princess Plant! I'll see you dudes later. [Shoots red beams out of his eyes at Finn and Jake and teleports them back to Ooo.] [At the Candy Kingdom, Princess Bubblegum arrives on Morrow, where Finn & Jake are waiting for her.] Hello, boys. Where’s my plant? Hello, Princess! Yay! [Eats one of the three flowers, much to the shock of Finn & Jake. Her hair then becomes smaller and curlier at the ends.] Thank you all for taking such good care of my plant! Now come here and give me a hug! Yay, hugs! [Whispers] Ahem. Mr. Finn, Mr. Jake, I believe you still owe me something in exchange for that favor I did. Sure! Yeah, what is it? I’d like your flesh. Quit bein’ silly, Peppermint Butler! [sniffs] Blech. Your tooth looks bad, dude. It smells like a garden shed in here. [groans in pain] Finn, I think you have to go dentist. I can't go dentist, Jake! You gotta take care of it. [sighs] Just go dentist, dude. [approaches rotten tooth] Okay. Easy does it... [presses against tooth] [screams] [screams] [panting] [exiting mouth] This is so bad. What did Princess Bubblegum say when you showed her? Aaaaaaaaaah. Hmm. Finn, this is literally serious. You have to go dentist. NOOOOOOO! Dude. You. Got. To. Go. Dentist. Blech. [running out] NOOOOO! I'm too strong for the world! [falls off bridge, crashes through the roof of the treasure room] I don't want to go dentist, Jake. They put you in a hole filled with snakes and rotten butter and they leave you there. Come on, man. It's not that bad. [sighs] Okay. [screams] Right? Whup! [screams as he falls to the bottom of the well] This isn't so bad... [his sword lands next to him] My sword! Wonder wh— [screams] Soft sand. [turns and sees an ant] Ant. Welcome to dentist, cadet. [salutes] I'm Leftenant Gamergate. [sniffs] Snakes and rotten butter. A common mistake—you were expected to arrive with snacks and a flashlight. Either way, you're here. So... dentist is ants? Dentist is dentist, cadet! Drop and give me twenty! I don't have any money. Funny man goes dentist, huh? The queen's office is in the royal hill. Holes. [opens door and turns the chair around to face him; it's empty] Hmm. Listen, I wasn't here when you came in. I'm a very busy woman. [sits down, swivels chair to face the wall, then swivels it back to face Finn] Hello, my name is General Tarsal. I am the current queen of this regiment, and please have a seat. As a first-time recruit, I'm confident that you have no idea what you're doing here. My tooth hurts. Let's take a look at your file. [opens drawer, takes out folder] Ah, you're a fighter! [to herself] We could use a fighter. My tooth hurts. What? Of course it does. Let me explain. You have gone dentist. That means that you will serve a brief tour of duty, and in exchange we will provide full dental rehabilitation. You will be on the front, fighting monsters... monstrous monster wooorms! Worms. The worms are employed by the flies. Worms. Work for the flies. You fight them; we'll fix your teeth. Me. Yes, you! [opens map] Your mission is to secure this junction at all costs. Upon completion of service, you will be sworn to absolute secrecy. The flies have spies everywhere. Fly spies! Heh heh. [imagines a fly dressed like a spy] These worms are no joke, so you'll be assigned a partner. Ah, let's see... Cadet... Tiffany Oiler. Tiffany?! [in Finn's mind] That guy wants to kill me! Tough nuts, that's dentist. Cadets, dinner is being served in the mess hall, central hill, sub-tunnel eight. Hm. Do you have anything less sugary? Yo, Finn! I'm gonna kill you! [sighs] [to himself] Doin' it for my tooth. [sits beside Tiffany] [growls and beats his chest] Ruff! Thought so. [shovels sugar into his mouth] [sighs] Hey, uh, partner. Um. So how are you doing, Tiffany? Yeah, I lost my teeth eating the Baker's Shard. It's a lot of sugar, right? Oh. Did you already know what dentist is? See, this is a good example of why I want to kill you. You're ignorant. [pokes Finn between the eyes] Heed my words, Finn. As the miller's wheel forever outrages the seed, so the good apple boringly receives his neighbor's worm. [quietly] The hey? And all the corn gets smooshed to grease—to grease under the miller's fleaping wheel. You're getting greased! Tiffany, look. We gotta work together, right? Why don't we let bygones be bygones? Bygones? Ha! [points to peach] That's you. Bye! [smashes peach with tray] Gone! [sighs] Do you want my peach? Bye-gone! [smashes Finn's peach] Hey! Stand down, cadets! Retire to your bunks! Tonight, light's out. Tomorrow, your eyes out! What the stork, man? This is my special sword. Why didn't you take one of those ant swords they offered you back there? I don't need some fancy thinger to kick butt when I've got these! [raises fists] You know about these? No. You will. Anyway, I just kinda wanted your sword 'cause it's pretty cool, I guess. Whatever. I'll get it soon enough... from off your dead corpse, you chump! [laughs] [sighs] Hey, Tiffany... you know, we're really not so different, you and I. Bullstuff. Well, we're both friends with Jake, and that's something, right? I was friends with Jake. Then some baritone herb stole him away from me. I didn't steal him. We're broth— And when that snow-white wiener dog is finally dead, Jake will be devastated. He'll need a shoulder to cry whiny, Finn-style tears on, and that shoulder will be mine— We won't just be robbing banks anymore. We'll be robbing the actual banks. The whole banks! You get it? We're gonna steal actual whole buildings. Yeah, I get it. So don't tell me we're not so different, okay?! We're opposites, you and me. Oil and goody-goody snow-white baby-vanilla bean mitten water! Go, [unsheathes sword] Man, that nut's gonna try and stick me while I'm not even looking. [sees his reflection in the sword's gem] Don't even stress it, Finn! Get in here, quick! The junction. There's something moving in the walls. It was like [imitates sound]. Wall worms! Holy cow! Dang it, Tiffany, not yet! We got to work together to beat the worms! Here they come! Tiffany! Oh, snap! Look out! They're coming in from the side! You good? My tooth hurts. Dang! It's the head worm, and she's livid! I say we get the heck out of heeeeere—! Finn! [hanging on to the ledge] Tiffany, quick! Pull me up! Quick, Tiffany! I'm slipping! Dang it, Tiffany! Weren't you paying attention? We're two peas in a pod! We're not oil and water. We're oil and vinegar! It's good, man. It's yummy! Mm... It's good for you! [sighs] You're right, Finn. I can't bring myself to do it... ...but I can't bring myself to save you, either. Why are you still smiling? Sorry. I didn't hear what you said. I was just gonna let it slide. Look, you're—you're on your own. I'm sorry. Catch you on the flip, I guess. Tiffany? [His hand slips] Tiffa— [falling] nooooooooo! [screams] Whoa! Easy, son. Don't try to speak. Your mouth is full of ants. Huh? It's okay. We just finished up. Ah. [smacks lips] What happened down there? Where's Tiffany? Well, the good news is the worm queen was defeated, choked to death on some foreign object, presumably Cadet Tiffany, who is missing in action, which is the bad news. Tiffany... But we didn't have to fix his teeth, which is nice news. But we did have to fix your teeth, which is okay news. [biting] Huh huh. Ayyyy! So, on behalf of the ant nation, I'd like to thank you for your service, which is now concluded. As soon as you're ready, we'll get you stuffed back up that well with all the snakes and butter. Holy cow. Welcome home, Finn. Yeah. Welcome home, buddy. Thanks, you guys! Man, you'll never believe it. Dentist is actually— Eh-eh-eh! [zips her lips] It was crazy! Tiffany was there— Whoa! Hey! Deh-deh-deh! [puts his finger to his lips] Wait. You all knew? What the heck? Why didn't you tell— Ah-ah-ah! [points to fly spy] You sad mobs. Y'all wish you had this sweet dang bucket! [A skeleton shoots the bucket Impertinence. [He shakes the lemon and drops it onto the ground.] Nyah! Grow! Grooow! Aha! [He takes the diamond and places it alongside a few others in a minecart.] [Crashing his minecart into the one containing Jake's diamonds.] Head's up! Oof. Oof. I got that bucket of pure river water you asked for. [He hands Jake the bucket.] Thanks, dude. Whatcha doing down here anyways? Digging up diamonds for a little project. I'll help, buddy. Whew. Hehe. [He begins throwing away more diamonds.] Vanilla no mods! Vanilla no mods! Vanilla no mods! Vanilla no mods! What the heck man?! [Jake shrugs.] It's such a senseless waste. Au contraire, mon friend. I'm extremely senseful. You see this bucket of water? It's in case I fall in the lava and catch fire. You could make something really good with these. Like a better sword for your best bro. Or [throws more diamonds]. [Picks up a diamond.] I'm gonna take this shiny boy, and show you the way. You do you, buddy. I'm sure you'd get it if you just took a moment to think about it. [He raises his voice as he takes a piston elevator back up to the surface.] [Indifferently] Uh huh. Look guys, it was totally epic. I wrecked the library's glass ceiling like, NBD, then I pushed a creeper down there and all the stupid smart dorks cried like tiny stupid babies. [Dismissively] Wenk wenk. That's small potaters. We should do something big. I got a storage full of live dynamite. [He pats the life-given TNT and it barks like a dog.] Hey. We should grief Finn and Jake. We could plant a tree on the Tree House! Huh..? Ugh. It's totally obvious you've never griefed anybody. That's only technically true. And not to be "that guy", but it's actually [air quotes] "aggrieved". You better grief someone quick if you wanna stay in the Gravel Gang! Only cool mean girls allowed! I'm ice-cool LSP. No! Call me by my gang name! Okay. Gravel Gal. Hnnngh. Grooooow! [Finn hands him a shovel.] Oh. Yes, of course. [He digs a hole and drops the lemon into it with a grunt, then starts hitting it with the shovel.] Grow. No grooooowth! Who here loves windmills? [One of the skeletons raises their hand and Yo, Marcy. That's a real nice windmill. Thanks. When it's done, I'm gonna grind up a whole mass of bone meal. What's that, boss? Keep working, buddy. So, whatcha got there? A little lump destined for something big. Just like your butt. Hah! Good one. But no. I want to turn this diamond into something complex and awesome to really wow Jake. Well I recommend building a windmill. A diamond windmill. No, that's silly. You need something more sciencey. [Finn throws her the diamond and she takes it over to a crafting table.] Diamond, lapis, some gunpowder, juicy nugget, add the star to more gunpowder and paper - There! [She produces a firework rocket.] I'm positive Jake will appreciate it for both its fleeting sensation of beauty, and its false sense of purpose. [Takes the firework and gestures for a high five.] Up top. What? Aw blocks. He's been at it all day. I should help him. See you later Finn. Alright. M'ladies. [He bows to Marceline and Bubblegum.] M'lemon. [He bows to Lemongrab and exits.] Nyarg! [He throws away the shovel.] Hey, it's okay buddy. Can't... tree! You can't just hit something with a shovel and expect it to do your bidding. Yeah you can. What? This is an oak sapling. This is a jungle sapling. [She hands him the saplings.]. And this... [She drops a lot of bone meal at his feet.] This is a lot of bone meal. Courtesy of Now we don't actually need the bone meal but it'll help speed things up, and as for the space requirements on the ground, it depends... [She is drowned out by Lemongrab screeching joyfully.] How many aces do you have? I got five. Oh shoot, I only got two. Hey y'all. [He drops into the room.] Finn! I was just passing through, but I could sure go for one of your famous apple pies. Say no more. [She walks to the oven, humming to herself, and removes a baking tray that resembles a crafting grid. She places onto it the ingredients for a pumpkin pie.] I'm no expert, but that kinda looks like a pumpkin. [Puts the ingredients in the oven.] Sorry about that. I'm just plum out of apples but I got lots of pumpkins. Too many pumpkins. [She gives Finn a pumpkin and he places it in his bag. The oven dings and [Takes the pie and sniffs it deeply before putting it in his backpack.] Uh, this might sound a bit weird but I'm kinda tired and it's a long way home... Say no more. [They both turn to Mr. Pig.] Fine. Bye bye boys. Whoa! [Reluctantly chasing the carrot on a stick.] You know you could just tell me where to go. [Whispering and turning his face away.] Dude, stop. Enderman. Don't look at it. It will- What the heck is that?! Oh Glob. Hey! Wee wee wee! Wee wee wee! Wee wee wee! Enderman! Fight me! [He pulls out the pumpkin pie and realizes he doesn't have a weapon.] Oh no. So, uh... Do you have, like, another job, or is this what you do full time? I saw you carrying that block back there. You into building stuff? I bet endermen have hobbies just like everyone else. Who-aah? Mhmm, mhmm, mhmm. Whew. Good work. Let's call it a day. [Muttering in her sleep] Meh. Beh. Beans? Beans. [She wakes up.] That noise. [She heads over to Finn.] Finn, I'm trying to sleep! [Whispering] Hey LSP. Don't be scared. [Speaking at regular volume] What are you even doing, just looking at this guy's toes? Yeah, I have to. Oh. I don't get it. Does this guy even have toes? Are those his toes? I don't think I've ever even seen a toe, come to think of it. What am I even talking about? [Suddenly hugs Lumpy Space Princess] Thank you I've been stuck here so long! [Blushing] Haha. Sure... Ew! You're all smelly and wet. Get out of here! Fair enough. [He exits.] [Quietly] But come back after you've showered. Yoink. [Laughs maniacally.] Thief! You got griefed! [He runs into the enderman with a grunt. It turns around and screeches at him. [Still half asleep] Good morning. How dare you. [With an exclamation of surprise, he notices that the tree has grown, and thinks he sees lemons growing in its leaves.] Lemon seed babies! [Clapping gleefully] Oh, you shall be my true heirs. [He knocks one of them down, revealing that it is in fact an apple.] What?! A apple? [sic] Unacceptable! UNACCEPTABLE! Oh, gracious. [She begins knocking down apples with the sword into the basket.] Good job, Lemon-crab. [She exits.] [Quietly] Pie me. Pie me for my apples. Pie. You won't believe what I went though to get this. Oh yeah, you were gonna make something right? [They both begin eating the pie.] [Sees that Jake has organised the diamonds into a neat pattern.] Whoa! You did it! You took the fruits of our labor and transformed them into something beautiful and unexpected. D'aw come on! Diamonds are so hard to get! [Jake shrugs.] Oh, duh. Beauty is in the hard work itself and the oftentimes false sense of purpose we feel when doing it. It's a fleeting sensation that drives us to repeat our actions in order to capture it again. [He lights the firework rocket and it explodes anticlimactically on the ceiling of the mine. A flow of lava falls from where it exploded.] That was supposed to be fireworks. I like this better. Hmm. [Reading aloud] 'Make more friends with sing-talking.' ♪ ♪ Hey there, Finn! Whatcha reading? ♪ ♪ It's a manuscript about "The Legend of Dead Mountain." Supposedly, if you get to the top, there's a treasure that will change you into the person you always wanted to be. Ha, that's a dumb story; I love dumb stories! What would you change about yourself if you got that treasure? Fix your weird cursed grass arm so it wouldn't be weird and cursed? Nah. I'd like to be taller. How tall we talking about? I don't know. Like, couple of inches. Say...tall as Princess Bubblegum? [Mockingly] Oh, I see. Jake, how would you change yourself on Dead Mountain if only the legends were true? [Leaning back] I wouldn't change anything; I'm the whole package. [Falls backward] Whoa! [Looks through book] Hey! There's a big warning about Dead Mountain in here. See? [Shows book] It says some kind of evil hermit guards the mountaintop. [Reading aloud] 'Don't let him look at you or something horrible will happen.' That seals the deal. The twin temptations of getting to grow a couple of inches and battling an evil hermit sound like a pretty perfect day. Let's go! Shh! [Whispering] Let's go. [Chanting] Gear up for battle! You smell like cattle! Gear up for battle! You smell... Like cattle! Monsters that get you by looking at you are so doomb. Everybody knows all you need is a mirror. They ought to get a new gimmick. [ No, it's a yurt. Yah! Rats! [Confused] Is that the hermit? [Disappointed] We don't get to fight the hermit. Hey look. What is it, boy? The treasure. Okay, here it goes. [Shakes snow globe] Oh great treasure, make my taste buds think they're tasting fried chicken even when I eat my fruits and vegetables. I don't have any fruits or vegetables on me. I guess I'll find out later if that worked. Your turn. [Speaking to globe] Oh great treasure, I want to be approximately 11.5 inches taller. [Stares at globe] Gross! It's leaking! [ This place is depressing. And I'm not growing taller. There's nothing going on here. ON TOP OF DEAD MOUNTAIN! We should have known better than to trust a book. Yeah. He makes one cool skeleton, though. [Walks up to Hermit] These shades... [Takes off sunglasses] Let me check out these shades. [Hermit's eyes shine brightly at Finn! Huh? Jake? You're awake! Oh, I was so worried. I've been waiting with a bowl of soup. It has hoops and loops and maybe some goop. [Fatigued] What happened? I don't remember getting into bed. Don't worry. You're gonna be fine... [Looks away] in no time. Thanks for taking care of me. You're the greatest big brother ever. [Jake transforms into a "jock"] W-Why are you doing that? I'm not. You're awake! You want some tea? Or saltine crackers? BMO, you're my little angel. I'm a real boy! [Wings sprout from his back] With wings! [Halo manifests above his head] And a halo! [ What's happening? I don't know but it probably has something to do with your weird old eyes. [Surprised] Something is wrong with my eyes? Aah! Hermit eyes! Dead-hermit eyes! Heh, it's fine. Do you think the hermit did this... to punish me for grabbing his shades? I think maybe the eyes are the treasure. So, then, am I making people what they want to be? No, because I don't want to be this awesome sweater bro. But maybe that's how you see me. Hey dudes. Nice eyes, Finn. What's the word? What's the haps? [ Whoa! Do you see Shelby as a bookish nerd? You're a nerd. I don't know, maybe. Is that bad? Hello? ... Hiya, P.B. What's up? ... You need help with your speech? ... An emergency?! ... On our way. [ Ah ah. Before we go... [ [Comparing two suits] What to wear for my speech...  Boss next door or hot president? Is this what you needed help with? No, I think I got this. Oh! Hi Finn and Jake. You guys look...cool. You trying out a new look? [Finn and Jake shrug at each other] Anyways, I'm preparing for a very important speech about the benefits of candying vegetables, and I need you guys to take care o-o-o-o-o-of [Walks over to balcony] that. Help Starchy set up chairs? No no no. That. Oh boy. We're on it, princess. It's probably nothing. He's been good lately, but it's a big speech, you know. [Eating a sandwich] Ohh. Ah. Hey Ice King! Aah! I'm not doing anything wrong. I was just lady-watching. [Tunic tears and Oh no. Where'd my muscles go?! I'm a scrawny-armed loser! [Runs off crying] That's how you see him? That's beautiful. Sure, I-I mean it's... It's hard not to sometimes. Where'd those glasses go? There. Starchy! Give those back, you thief! [Transforms wearing a burglar outfit] Huh? No way! Starchy, you butt! [ Oof, sorry. What's going on here? [Becomes transformed] Can you explain this? I don't know. I'm not a psychiatrist! Come on, let's get you home, dude. Peebs, good luck with the speech. But... Teen boy heartthrob it is. Okay, at least now we're safe from you donking up any more of our friends. Nobody got hurt. Have any of you guys seen BMO? Aah! Did I kill Neptr?! You turned him into a microwave. So...yeah, you kind of did. But... but... but... That's not how I see Neptr, is it? I like Neptr. He's like my half-son. If I was a better person, would I be turning my friends into better things? Am I uncaring, judgmental... Uh, Finn. Self-centered? Monstrous? I'm... I'm... I'm a huge wa-a-a-a-a-d! [Runs through Tree Fort and off into the hills] Finn! You're being melodramatic! I know it's you. Hey, buddy. I figured you'd come back here. Don't look at me, Jake. I might turn you into a microwave. Baloney! You turned Neptr into a microwave because he's a microwave. But that doesn't mean that's all he is to you. I know you think Neptr is an interesting person, and I know that "microwave" is just one part of his personality. I mean...maybe your eyes are just bad at describing things, you know? Like how you feel about people, what they mean to you... That stuff's in your guts. Eyes can't grok that... Unless you have the eyes of like a trained artist or something. But you don't. I'm telling you, man you're not a bad dude like this skeleton bro, or you'd be turning everyone into rats and plops. Now come on. Look at me. Jake, you're so wise. What?! Di- Wha... Well, at least you're listening to me. And wise old He may not be the most cunning soldier, but one thing about Finn is that he always puts other people first, and that makes him a true hero. Finn helped What a life saver. Finn's a mean old party pooper. [PB nudges Ice King] Ow! But he is the hottest guy in Ooo, so he can kind of do what he wants. Finn's just the best guy to do bro stuff with, like lying on the grass and talking to bugs or baking chocolate chip cookies. Finn's just a good friend. I'm me again. These balls are going nuts. [The hermit's eyes pop-out of Eye pie! Ew. Good job, Neptr. You saved the day. [Carrying Neptr out] Neptr! Neptr! Neptr! Neptr! Neptr! Neptr! Yay! I just had the most wonderful dream. Safety! [Jumping out] Patrol! Safety! [Jumping out] Patrol! Safety patrol! Safety— Oh... Were we not wearing the uniforms? C'mon. Let's keep lookin' for hazards. Look out! What is it, dude? Shushers, man! [Pointing at village] Look there! Just looks like an ordinary little town, man. Yeah... [Puts on binoculars] Suspiciously ordinary. Oh! Little house people! Maybe it is just regular ordinary, not sinister ordinary—oh, no, wait... Grass ogre. Haha! [Putting chicken in mailbox] Hey, chicken, you're travelin' egg-spress! [Laughs] It's an obnoxious grass ogre. You get my joke, right?! Hahaha! Careful, you oaf! Those chickens are rentals! [Donny fires an egg at him.] Agh! [Firing eggs] We're havin' so much fun, huh?! Drop that chicken! [Stopping] Huh? You're under arrest! [Donny comes over and drops the chicken.] Good... Now get in your tiny cell... Oh, uh, oh! Hey, ogre! Stop hazing these cute little houses! Ya jerkball! My name is Sorry. I was just tryina' get your attention. What kinda houses are you supposed to be? A... stupid... uh... a dumb house?! Haha! Hey, what's with your jowl?! [Flicks Jake's jowl] Ow! Hahaha! I'm gonna mess with these housies some more. NEVER!! So you wanna wrestle, huh? 'Cause I know, like, this ninja move to get out of this lock instantly! Okay... Now, first I... [Finn squeezes [To himself] Whoa. You're doin' it wrong! Whaddaya mean? First, you roll your right shoulder forward... Like this? Yeah, but then I counter it by doin' this! [He grabs Donny again and squeezes.] Hey! Um... You need to take a break? No... but if you need to, we can stop... [Finn gets off] Ya baby. Whoa, I zoned out there for a bit. Did you win? Nah. Just takin' five. Donny's pretty good. Yeah, well, you're okay, too. Thanks, man. ...For a complete idiot! Aww... Donald, quit all this jerky nonsense! [Forms giant, tree-like ears] Unless you wanna get gored by a forest prince! I was just kiddin' around, but then you took it too far! You guys are the real jerks! [ Donny is one mixed-up dude. Nah. He's just rough-and-tumble, like me, but deep down, he's probably really sensitive, like me. You're a mixed-up dude, too! Hey, Donny! What? I was thinkin' that since you're a pretty good wrestler, maybe you'd wanna hang out with a couple a' rascals like me and Jake! What? Muuuh... I don't know. Messin' with these housies is pretty fun. You got somethin' better? [To Finn] You sure this is a good idea? [To Donny] If you come to the Tree Fort, we got video games and apple juice! [Eager] Really?! [Pulling back, pretending not to care] I mean... if it keeps you from cryin'... [To Jake] Donny's problem is that he's treated like an outsider, like me. You are not an outsider. You wear cute little blue shorts! I... am complicated. Uh... This fort isn't so great. Not as cool as the fort I'm gonna build. [Sitting down] I call this chair! Hey, Donny, you should play Bug Battle. [Putting game in BMO] And hey, can you put on some pants?! You put on some pants! I have pants... [Grabs transparent pants] spun from spiderwebs... by pixies. [To Donny] Okay. There's you, and here come the bugs. Huh?! Oh, yeah. Those guys'll get ya. [Breaking controller] Urgh!! This game cheats! [Throws controller parts at BMO, knocking it down] Not cool, dude. Have more apple juice. It always makes me feel better when I— [Donny splashes the apple juice in What? What'd I do? Finn, I don't think this is gonna work. I am incapable of all emotion.... but you are making me chafed!! Everybody's gettin' mad at me for nothin'! You have to think about how your actions make other people feel. Ohh. Hmm. I don't understand at all. Ooh! Teach him that little empathy song I taught you! Okay, yeah! [Singing] Empathy, empathy, put yourself in the place of me! [Speaking] Your turn! Uh... Empathy, empathy, put yourself... Ohh! So it's like, when I squeeze eggs outta chickens, I should let them squeeze eggs outta me, too! ...Um... kinda right. [Screams are heard.] Someone needs our help! Jake, you stay here and try to fix him, while I deal with an unknown possibly deadly emergency! [Runs off] Dude, trade me jobs. Jake! Someone broke your... um... entire living room! Quick! Act abandoned! Hands off the housing market! [The wolf attacks Stop in the name of the law! Is there somewhere I can trap that thing? Well, there was a zoo, but he moved back east. Course, there's always the old well. I'm not old! Perfect! [ Mr. Bank! Are you alright?! Oh, it's fine, it's fine. All my assets are insured. Pardon. [Leaving] I have to go spackle my cracks. [To himself] Why is this town just getting worse and worse? [From inside old well] Yes! Why indeed!! [To werewolf] Hey! What are you werewolves up to?! We're not werewolves... [The wolf reveals a suit he's wearing.] [Calmer common voice] We're Why-wolves. Uh... Why-wolves? Creatures possessed by the spirit of inquiry..... [Growling voice] AND... BLOODLUST!! What?! [Normal voice] Please. Save your questions until the end of the lecture. [Demonstrating by drawing on dirt] Our ecosystem. At the bottom level are the house people. Given the opportunity, we Why-wolves would easily wipe them out. However, Donny's presence is a natural deterrent. His jerkiness is so powerful that it produces a pungent gas—obnoxygen. To Why-wolves, it is a deadly poison. But since you've removed the jerk Donny, we will devour the houses, and our population will rapidly swell until we are, in turn, devoured by the Cosmic Owl. Such is the course of nature, but it'll be a pretty sweet ride up until that point. [Growling voice] TONIGHT, WE FEAST ON THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENTS! [He howls. The Siamese twin Oh, no! I have to get Donny back! [Talking quickly] Donny, you have to go right now, and stop the Why-wolves from— [Pleasantly] Ah! Master Finn has returned! What's it goin'?! Thanks to you, I shall never be jerky again! Oh, no... Oh, no. Oh, no, nonononononono! No! This is all wrong! We need jerk Donny to make the obnoxygen, and, and— Steady on, Finn. Perhaps you are dehydrated! It's as Jake taught me [Singing] "8 ounces, 8 glasses, 8 days a week!" [Speaking] I'll fetch you some tap water. Are you wearing jeans now?! Surely! [Singing] Gotta get pants! Go get your pants! Button, fly! I wrote that one myself. Perdoname. [Leaves] But, but, but— Butt, butt, butt! Yeah, Donny! You're lookin' good in those jeans! What did you do?! Miraculous, isn't it? I just kept teachin' him my musical rules, and now, he's perfect. No! We messed up, Jake! The House People are doomed if Donny doesn't go back to being town jerk! [Clears throat] I have no intention of being a jerk again. Hmph. But the housies will be wiped out if you don't! It sounds tragic, but I'm turning over a new leaf! [Literally does so] Donny, you gotta go! Finn, "no" means, "no." I'm sure you'll respect my wishes. [Cut to Finn and Jake forcefully dragging Now, go be a jerk to those Why-wolves! No! I'll use my musical messages to stop them! [Finn and Jake hang their mouths open, not believing what they are hearing.] Let's see... I've got one on the ethics of laundry... Crosswalk-ery... Ooh! Here's a good one! Man! The town is getting creamed! By not being a jerk, you're being a real jerk, Donny!! [Singing] Comb your hair right! It's a good time! Sticky, sticky pomades, short back and sides! [No one responds] [Speaking] Why isn't anybody paying attention to my words? [To Jake] He sure is sensitive about his songs! [Gasps] [To Donny] It's cuz they think your songs are dumb! Wha?! [To Finn] What're you saying?! If you don't encourage his talent, he might revert back to jerk Do— [In realization] OHHH, OHHH! [To Donny] HEY, DONNY! EVERYONE SAYS YOUR SONGS ARE SUPER BALLS!! They all think you're a real jerk! But... but I've changed! Why would they say that?! [Singing weakly] Empathy, empathy, put your mind insi... You're so pathetic! So comical! [Getting angry] Rrrrr... Think I'm a jerk do they? I'm feelin'.. obnoxious!! [He rips out of his clothes in rage.] HEY, YOU WHY-WOLVES ARE COOL! JUST KIDDING! [Releasing obnoxygen] HAHAHAHA!! Obnoxygen cloud!! EGRESS!! The town is saved!! Get offa' me, nerds!! You did it, Donny! You're a full-blown jerk again! What?! You're the jerk!! Housies! Ready to hear my new song?! It's about how Finn will betray you, just to save lives! [Gravely] I'm sorry, Donny. I'll never forgive you, Finn!! [Angrily spraying House People with eggs] WAAAAAAH!!! [To Finn] C'mon. We can go stare wistfully at the lake. [Tired] I'd... I'd like that. Very much. Hey! I love bein' a jerk! Thanks, Finn! Finn? [The heroes have left.] Finn, you loser! [Whispering] I'll never... forget you! Oh man! Alright, what's next? Haha, let's see... [Begins to count on his fingers] First we visit Tree Trunks for apple pie, and then we go to Bubblegum's science music thing! Wait, what about the movie at the drive-in? That's after we make dream sandwiches! Whoo! [Stands up and runs off] Let's go, apple pie! [Runs after him] Whoo! [In the distance] Tree Trunks! [Turns around] Huh? TT! Tree Trunks! Oh my, look who's here! Yoo-hoo! [Waves with trunk.] Oh yeah! Howdy, Jake! Howdy, Finn! Hello! What'cha ya doin' here? I never really left. Mr. Pig's been so kind helpin' me, hehe, tend to my rose garden. Hmmm. Cool. Cool cool. Cool cool cool. Cool cool cool cool! Oh, you. Where's the apple pie, Tree Trunks? Yeah, my stomach is jonesin' for it bad! [Stomach growls] Oh, you all are so early that I haven't even started! [Walks inside] [Sighs] I love her so much. WHOA! You love 'er?! Whaa? No! [Points] You just said you love 'er. [Looks down] You're crazy. Dude, come on, we heard you. [Sighs anxiously, turns around with arms raised] I think I am in love with her! But I don't know how to go about it... [Looks down, sad.] Dude, you should just tell her how you feel! [Lays arms on rosebush] Phew... There you are, what are you boys chattin' about? Hmmm? Uh-huh, alright okay... [Clears throat] Ms. Tree Trunks... Ma'am, today, I wish to speak my feelings. Mr. Pig, what's going on? Ohhhhh! [Smells rose and then eats it.] Mmmm, that's good. Shush. I feel the same. I have a feeling that this is the feeling others call... love. [Finn and Jake stand by and watch.] What should we do then? We should hug. [Extends arms.] Tree Trunks... you gonna bring some pie to Princess Bubblegum's thing? Uh... Yeah, Jake, yeah! [Continues to hug.] Well... Okay... [Turn around and begins to walk away with Finn.] See you later then. [Inaudible.] [Stomach growls and he begins to look around.] Where is she? [Stands up on bleacher and walks over to Finn, and puts his hands on his shoulder.] You givin' me a back rub, bro? What? [Puts both hands on Finn's shoulders.] Yeah, yeah, yeah... [Walks to the side of the bleacher and groans.] Is that-?! [Sees someone and gasps.] It's Tree Trunks! Pie! Pie!! [Lays down.] Lay it right here. [Points to stomach.] Oh Jake, I tried to bake an apple pie, but this cutie kept distracting me. [Her and Mr. Pig giggle. Mr. Pig kisses No apple pie?! [Whispers to another Candy Person] This is making me uncomfortable... They're snuggling too loud! What's happening? I forgot my glasses! Huh? Oh, gross! Hyeah! Break it up, break it up! Okay, the love show is over! Princess, please continue. Hm! [Continues to play.] Ah! Ah! This is too much! [Begins to hyperventilate and starts screaming.] It's driving me crazy! Cinnamon Bun, do something! ...Okay. Hey everyone! The concert is over! That's not what I- The concert's over, Princess! Princess, how's about a slow song so me and my man can dance cheek to cheek. [Her and Mr. Pig put their two cheeks together and hum.] Hm! [Walks away, annoyed and begins to clean up. She grabs the beakers while Cinnamon Bun picks up the electric piano. They pass Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig and say "Hm!" with one eye closed.] Why's everybody givin' me the hairy eyeball? Y'all are too affectionate. It makes people feel... bothered when you and the Pig your affection in public! They don't want us to flaunt what we have? You two need to hide your love... or else, you'll end up making the whole world throw up! We promise to keep our affection hidden. Thank you. Have you seen my other shoe? I think I saw it in the closet! Ahhh! Under my shoe?! Outta here! This carriage is for babies! [Knocks them out of the stroller.] For babies!! Nice stacks of sandwiches! [Spreads something on bread] You shouldn'ta bought so many flavors! I had to make a sandwich for each flavor, and for each flavor combination! I'm makin' a cheese sandwich! [Puts a slice of bread with cheese on it on another slice of bread, only to find Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig kissing on it.] Tree Trunks! Pig! Come on! We're trying to hide our love, but it's so difficult! [Chews on pieces of bread.] Try harder! [Looks around] Doesn't look like Tree Trunks and Pig are around! Yeah, looks like the cost is clear! [Puts a cup in his hand towards the screen] Look at this cup! [Puts second cup in his other hand towards the screen] Now, look at this cup! Look at this one! [Points to cup as big as him. A shadow of Tree Trunks come across the screen and cover it so the movie can no longer be seen.] Aw, man! [Sigh] Just try to ignore it and watch the movie! I can't ignore that! [Points towards the screen, which is completely covered by Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig's  shadow. Entire crowd groans and protests in disgust. Stoooooop! Tree Trunks, this has gone on long enough! No more spending time with the Pig, unless you do it, inside your own home. But Finn, an unmarried couple living together one roof, that's undecent! Then, why don't you two just get married? We don't wanna rush things- Uh... marriage is a big step. -we need time to get to know each other. Then I guess we only have one option. Alright. [Him and Jake begin to pull them apart.] You can't do this! Wait Nooo! Stop! Take 'em away! Sweet meat! Little dove! [Carrying Tree Trunks] Sorry, Tree Trunks. [Dragging Mr. Pig] So... where do you live? [Staring off into space, said emotionless] I'm homeless. Oh... I guess I'll just go back to eating criminals. [Chugs drink and begins to cry.] I miss her... I don't know what I'm going to do without him, Finn! Why don't you make apple pie to take your mind off of it? [Tears roll down her cheeks] Dream of love... Is it really over? Can I overcome these tears? I close my eyes, feel that he's still with me. Still standing with me here... Dream of love... Are we truly parted? Must this Pig forever walk alone? In my dreams, our love is just a dream to me... but in my heart, it lives and breaths and grows. [Cuts apples] And even though, we ain't allowed to be together. I cross my heart and promise to be true. Well, I'm still lovin' you, girl, from halfway 'cross this great, big, world! [Spotlight shines on him.] And in my dreams, I'm holding hands with yoooooooooooou! Dream of love... Dream of love... [A tear runs down Jake's cheek] It's only a dream of loooooove. Dream of love... Dream of loooooooove, it's only a dream... of love. [Pulls apple pie out of the oven.] I close my eyes, and feel his arms around me, in my dreams... he's not so far away. [Trying not to cry] Go to him. [Trying not to cry.] Go. [Gasps, nods and runs off.] I'm freaking out!! You know what? I like it. It's nice. Yeah. Mmmm, apple pie I've been waiting to kiss you all day! [Shoves face in pie as the episode ends.] [to Finn and Jake] Alright, guys. Hammer all these safety signs around this dungeon hole. I've gotta jet off on my swan to take care of some royal junk. You got it, Princess. Whatever you want, mama. Bubblegum, away!! Ow. Ow. Ow. There. That's the last sign, Jake. Now no one will go down this hole, ever. Probably a lot of dangerous, awesome stuff down this hole. I better go take a look. Don't, dude. For you see, that's the secret entrance to the Dungeon of the Crystal Eye! Whoa. Legend has it that the eye rests in the deepest chamber of this accursed dungeon. Man, we shouldn't even be talkin' about it, 'cause it's lunch time. [holds out picnic equipment] The crystal eye. I wanna meet this dungeon. Maybe after lunch. Eh, I'll skip lunch. Just catch up with me when you are finished. *Pfft* Yeah, right. What? Without the aid of my magnificent powers... [shapes hand into bottle opener and opens a bottle of water] ...Huh? Huh? You'd get killed down there. Hey! I can do things without you! You wanna bet I can't? Nope. Come get your sandwich. [using Finn's sandwich as a puppet] Listen to We are betting! I bet that I'll get that crystal eye and be back within 11 minutes. [quickly] Ready set go! [jumps down hole] [sighs] I better go after him. No, Jake! Stay here, with me... Oh, my... [makes out with the sandwich] Dungeons! Chambers! Woah. [Sees bugbears everywhere] Evil creatures! [laughs as monsters chase him] Treasure chests! [treasure chest is actually a mimic monster, Doorways! [floorboards try to close on him] Traps! [Long jumps out of trap] I'm in my elemeeeeeeeeent!! [Lands in chamber, sees a kitten's head sticking out of a black cave entrance] Aww! [freaked out] Oh? Whoa! Somebody come pick up your freaky cat. Greetings, Frank the Human Boy. How did you almost know my name?! I have approximate knowledge of many things. For instance, I know that I am possibly going to slay you and munch on your eyeballs. [circles Finn] Huh, yeah right. That sounds like idiot talk! You're trespassing on my dungeon, manling. And I am the thing... [brandishes claws] ...you should be afraid of. You can't hurt me! I'm a radical boy on a mission for the crystal eye! I'm going to unzip your skin and wear you like a little coat. Unzip this! [Does an armpit-fart, jumps back] Bleep! [Demon Cat holds him down, and fiendishly bites at him] OOF! Now, you DIE!! [Leaps at Finn, and tears up his clothes, then stops] Wait a minute. [Sniffs twice] Is that dog smell?! You... you have a dog with you? I'm outta here! [Runs away] Yeah, right! Good excuse! Slaps, that cat was kicking my buns! And it might have finished my buns if it weren't for Jake's stank. Dang it, Jake! I'll get that crystal eye on my own! With my own odors. [walks by 3 different doors] Hmm, no to skeletal remains door. [Sees a door that is a monsters mouth, If Jake was here, he could stretch his hand into a key and open it. [shapes his hand like a key] Yeah! Key hand! [tries to open the door, but bruises his hand] Ouch! [notices a green glow coming from a hatch] Hey! What the jug is that? Oh, sweet, the key! Ew, jelly cube?! [Tries to get the key but almost gets sucked in] Come on! Give it to me! Don't flaunt it if you're not gonna give it up! [Screaming, falls out of the cube] I'll never get that crystal eye! No. No, I just gotta stay pumped. [starts dancing, and singing] Pump it up, pump it up! Whoo! Whoo! Shake it! Shake it! Ahh! [Falls through the floor, lands in a waterfall chamber] Steady, Halt! Come no further adventurer, for you see none can defeat... the Okay, then I won't fight you. No! You must challenge me to-- [Finn interrupts him] Hey cutie, do you know how to get to the crystal eye from here? Yes, it's through that door over there, but-- [Finn runs past him] Thanks! Hey! You can't pass through that door with out battling me! Yes, I can. Because I'm huge compared to you. Aw, buckets. Now, activate thine own powers, and we shall engage in thrilling single combat! [nervously] Heh, thing is... I don't really... have any powers. [smiles] I see... AAAAH!! Dang it, Jake wouldn't be running! He'd grow all big, and sock you right in the nose hole! [Bucket Knight kicks the gorund, which it's vibration sends Oww... I rode the knuckle train? But... I... I'm in my element. AHHHHH!!!! Ow! OW! Ow! OW! Ow! Uhh! That... sucked. [Takes a deep breath] Alright, Hey, my dinner is back. And your dog isn't with you! That's what you said, right? Jack the Dog is not "accompanying" you? You mean Jake? Jake, Jack, whatever. He's not here, which means I'm going to rip your heart out. [Chases Finn] Crud, crud, crud, crud, crud! You can't hide from me, Jim. I know almost everything, remember? I know exactly where you might be, Jim. I'm about to pounce on you. One... two... three! [jumps behind a rock] Aw, man! I thought you'd be behind this rock. Hmm... [sniffs twice] Alright. I know where you are now! And I'm about to pounce again! [Finn gets more scared] One... two... three! [jumps behind another rock] Aw, man! Well, there's only a few more places to look. Oh, Jake... I'm such a fool. A silly, silly fool. [a hand touches his mouth] Who the heck--?! Hey, it's okay. Shh, I'm your guardian angel, Finn. I'm here to save you. Re...really? Mmm-hm. Come here, let the angel pick you up. Okay. [Flies away with the angel, laughs] This is radical. Are you comfortable? Would you like some snacks? I'm fine, thank you. Here, let me clean you up, and mend your clothes. [Casts healing magic to clean up Finn and fix his clothes] Ha ha ha ha ha! I'm taking you to the chamber of the Crystal Eye.... Aww, yeah! ... where I'm going to cook you and eat your flesh. Wow... Wait! What??! Trust in your [The "angel" shows her true colors as her face misshapens into a hideous form, and a raspy voice] guardian angel! Put me down, lady! As you wish. Man, everybody wants to eat me up. It's probably 'cause I'm so sweet. Now for little kid soup. [Lights a fire] The secret is a low flame over a long period. That's Jake's secret, too. I sure hope he saves me. [Flies away with beautiful face] I will save thee, Finn. Lady, you are sick! Oh, Jake. What? Jake! Finn! What are you doing here?! I was looking for you, knucklehead! I was so worried, that right after lunch, I plunged into the dungeon after you. Strangest thing, though, I kept runnin' into obstacles. Choose your dueling weapon! Uh... I choose... sandwich! [He grabs his sandwich and fights with the reaper who simply cuts through it with a sword] [voiceover] The challenges were impossible for me. [voiceover] But you would have blown right through. I kept thinking to myself, "What would Finn do?" Just...eh, frustrating. Know what I mean? Yeah... I think I do. [Both chuckle, there's a moment of silence] Now let's find a way out of this cage. I'll get us out with Key Hand! [forms a Key Hand] I really don't see any key holes on this cage. Not a problem, man. Lock Hand! [laughs] I'll get us out of here, with carrot hand! Alright, man. Let's go! We've still got a couple minutes left to steal that crystal eye and win your bet! Wait! You'd help me win a bet that I made that I said I could accomplish something without you? Just hop on my powdered doughnut, boy! Cling! Alright, man. Let's give this crystal eye the old friendship lift. Okay. Friendship, go! If I die, I'll have died with my best friend! Me, too! Get on my swan! I hope you learned a lesson from all this! Uh, we learned that working together is better. Heh, whatever. [whispers to Finn] Looks like that's not the answer she wanted. Uhh... I learned that you're a very... intelligent princess? You're darn right I am. What... is the meaning of "soup"? What? I don't know. What's with all the weird quest—? What... is the meaning of "spoon"? Shoot, man, are you still lady-sad about Flame Princess? Y'know, it's okay if you are. Naw, that's all fine. I just been feeling kind of... gray, is all. Like my inside voice has been kinda quiet lately. Not a lot of instructions forthcoming, y'know? Yeah, well, sounds like you're sad. Listen, Finn, girls is like horses. When you fall down, it's important that you get right back on again—on a different horse. And there's a lot of fish in the sea. A lot of fish. A penny saved is a penny earned. Yeah, I-I guess. Or maybe dating girls is like riding a bicycle. Yeah, man, yeah! Or, like, if you mess up, you could get really hurt forever, or hurt someone you really care about. Eh, well, I suppose. Anyway, I hope this mystery cave we're looking for is as weird as Flambo's brother says it is. Maybe that'll snap you out of the—[stops walking] Whoa! What?! What's this train all about? No one said nothing about no train in the way! Relax, buddy. We'll just cross after it passes. No big thing, really. Oh, yeah. It's two hours later now. What the stunk? [stretches up above the train, seeing that the train is going around in a circular track] Oh, okay. [stretches back down] Hey, the train just goes in a big circle! We can cut right through the middle, blingle, blongle, blungle! Come on! [grabs Finn and stretches them onto the train] Wha-hey! You know, I just had another idea! If we just stay put here on the train, we could ride it all the way to the cave. [a door opens behind them] Blingle, blongle, blungle! Gimme! Gimme the loot! [hits Finn's head] Ow! Yeeow! Gimme! Gimme that hat! [grabs Finn's hat] Knock it off! [punches him in the chest and bites his arm] Aah! Oh, dang! [laughs] Hey, Finn! Whoa! Look at all the loot that guy dropped while you whipped his butt! Dang, look at that sword! [picks up the Lightning Sword] Whoa. Feels kinda right. [waving it around] Whoosh. Whoosh. Vvsh, vvsh. [points it at the wall, causing it to shoot electricity] [laughs] Whoa! [laughs] Pretty fun, huh? Yeah, man! It's spicy baby fun! You wanna go see what other kind of monsters are on this train? Yes! [runs off] [following him] [laughs] Whoa, Crystal Ants, I think! [runs past them, zapping each with his sword] [laughs] Cool! [picks up loot] [laughs] Ha-ha! Yeah! [slicing each one] Die, die, die, die, die, die, die! [laughs] [laughs] [to himself] Welcome back, buddy. Man, look at all this rad loot! Yeah, this is a pretty neat train. We should come back again someday. Whoa, what do you mean? We just started only, like, three hours ago. Heheh, yeah. I'm just gettin' a little bored, is all. All these cars of monsters are kinda all the same. It's a little boring. Oh, come on. [elbows him lightly] It's fun! Just one more car. Come on. [elbows him] Come on, man! [elbows him again] Come on! All right, just one more. Ha-ha, yes! [sighs] Hmm? Where is everybody? Hey, hey! Empty car—think we beat it, buddy. Whoa, man! Boss battle! Let's chew it up! [runs toward the monster] Okay, but this is the last one, okay? We'll see! Ha-ha! Hey, man, [hitting monster with a stick] you remember we were going to that weird cave? Bet it's not too late to check it out. [attacking monster] Eh, weird cave, weird train—I'm cool here. [sighs] Okay. Hyah! [hits the monster's crown] Ahhhh, gimme a break! Oh? Oh, dang. Boss loot! [puts on the crown and dances] Oh, yeah. [the crown emits fire] No, thank you. Jake, hurry. Next car! Slime crimes! [starts fighting] You have fun. I'm just gonna watch. [sits on a ledge away from the fight] [sees a gold shield one monster dropped] Hey. Ow! [laughing] Ow. Cool... acid! Hey, also, man, aren't you, like, gettin' kinda hungry? Yeah, man. I guess we've been here for a while. More than a while, dude. I've already missed my bathroom window! Yeah, I guess I could take a snack break. 'Kay! Well, we'll go back to the tree house, and I'll make us some lunch. I could make the toaster pancakes you like. And maybe I can boil up some hot dogs, or— [eating noisily] Look. [points to meat] Now we don't gotta do that thing you wanted to do. [uses his crown's flames to throw the meat at Jake] [dodging it] Aah! Hot meat! Ants again? [goes to sit in the corner] "Ant" no thang! [smashes one] Yah! [smashes another] Caught with your "ants" down! "Ants" for nothin'! [kills another] Forget about "ant"! [kicks one] What's wrong? Feeling antsy? [kills another and continues killing them] [sighs] Dude, this is the ant car. We already did the ant car. We did all the ants! Same car, [punches an ant] but those were blue ants. These are red ants. Finn, I think we should take off. I think this place is bad news for you. Man, no way. All this feels good. [smashes another ant] Like my inside voice is saying, "Hey, keep it up. This is good stuff." [two ants attack him] Aah! Hey! [knocks them away] Ah! Like when you made those biscuits way back? And I kept eating them until they were all gone. Like that! Finn, [stands up] I made those biscuits with so much butter. You were just responding to the butter! This whole place is butter! Yeah! [smashes the last ant] Boss fight! [charges at it, blasting fire from his crown] [laughs] [gets back up and continues fighting offscreen] My jacket-sta! [disappears in a flash of light] [holding loot] Check it out battle moon. What? [picks it up and looks in it] [gasps] Finn! This is a future crystal! Look! That's you, dude! You're old, you're alone, and you're still fighting on this dumb train! [slashes the ants] Get "ant" of town. Whoa. I'm gonna have the best life! Oh, Hair Apes! Nuh-uh, dude. I'm bored, I'm tired, and I'm goin' back to the tree house. [opens up the side of the train] You can come with me if you want. What? No, man! It's better on the train; stuff makes sense here. [hoots] [zaps Finn] Yow! [laughs] [shoots a bolt from his wand at the ape, killing it] I'm sorry. If you wish to join me, I'll be in the tree house experiencing the joys of life and not getting attacked by gorillas made out of hair. You'll be back. No, I won't, Finn. [hops onto the outside of the train] Goodbye! [sighs] [hoots] Hey! [laughs] [runs toward it] "Hair" we go! [climbs on top of the rain, finding a Hair Ape] What're you doin' up here? [hoots] [shrugs] [takes off his hat and sits next to it] Are you gettin' sick of things down there, too? [hoots] Mm-hmm. You're not gonna try and zap me, are you? I wonder what my kids are doin'. [falls asleep] Hey! [dodges zap] I knew it! [walks off] Gotta find that kid. Hey, Finn! [opens door] Fi—oh! [sees someone with a metal helmet, a cloak of fire, and a battle moon] Umm... hey, there, friend. I ain't lookin' for no trouble. Just lookin' for my friend, Finn. Maybe you seen him? About five feet tall, picks his nose, and always kinda smells funny l— Hey, hey! Jake, it's me! [opens visor to helmet] I'm just all souped up now. Ah, jeez, Finn. I... for a minute there, I thought you were one of those twisted-lost-soul boss guys. [wiggles his tongue] Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl. Wait, you are! You are one! What? Those guys are cool! That's it, man! I'm gettin' you off this train whether you like it or not! [advancing toward him] Jake, stay back. I mean it! Oh, please. What're you gonna do? I'm ten times stronger than— [laughs] Ah, gross! [coughs] [grabs Jake's pack] Yoink! [laughs] [runs to the next car] Pff, Jake—tryin' to tell me what to do. Pff, yeah, right. I tells me what to do. Now let's see what we got here. [reaches into Jake's pack] Apple, apple, chicken, apple... [pulls out future crystal] Oh, yeah, that little orb in which I rule! Let's see that again, orb. [the crystal reveals an old Finn, can we slow down? My feet hurt. What? Oh, Jake. Hang in there, buddy. I'ma set this right. Finn? Finn, I'm sorry. I'll stay on the train with you, I swear. Just get this stuff off of me. [using wand to take back silk] No, I'm sorry, Jake. I messed up, but don't worry. It's all over now. You mean we're gettin' off the train? Well... you are. I'm gonna keep playin' for a while. I'll meet you back home in a week or two. Aw, man, don't you see that's just the train talkin'? It's got its hooks in you! [hits Finn's head lightly] [laughs] No, no for real! [pats forehead] My inside is tellin' me it's time. Here, [hands Jake the future crystal] see for yourself. Yeah, man. That's what I'm talkin' about. That... is what I'm talkin' about. Sumo Scootz! [making sfx for the game] Vroom vroom skreeee! [Jake's character defeats Finn's] Winner! Whoo! 79th consecutive victory! [stretches his buttocks toward Finn's face] In yo fa-ace! [Finn doesn't react] You okay, buddy? [hits Finn's cheek with one of his buttocks] Still bummed out about Flame Princess? [nods] Hmm. I know what'll fix you up girl's night out, boy style! First, we'll go to the salon, get yo hair did and your nails all—wait, no. First, we'll go to the shops, get you a brand new hat. Then, we'll—[toilet flushes] [gasps] [hides in the couch] A burgler-mer! Aah! The Ice King? Grr—eh! [Jake holds his nose] Jeez, you couldn't wait two seconds? Ech. [pinches nose] [nasally] Why are you stinkin' up our house? Didn't you get my text? It said I'm stayin' [takes out banana phone] with you guys—[looks at phone] oh, didn't go through. Well, anyways, I knew you wouldn't mind since it's sorta your fault I'm homeless, right? Right. 'Cause you tricked your crazy ex into meltin' my Mmhm. With your lies and secrets? 'Member when that happened? Dude, you can't stay here if you're gonna stank it up with your bad vibes, man! Yeah, I'm just crashing here while the penguins rebuild. I've given Gunter temporary reign. Should be fine. Flame Princess isn't crazy. You're blind, Finn. You're blind—wait, she isn't here, is she? No. Whew! She said she wanted time to herself. [walks out] Yeesh. Yeah, breakups are tough. Heh, yeah, like, remember how you and I were married? Uh! It's so confusing! Hmm? [to creature] I thought Finn was a stand-up guy, you know? But he basically betrayed me. Why do people even have secrets? It's like that in the Fire Kingdom, too. Everyone is all deceitful and Shakespeare. But out here doesn't seem any different. [scribbling sounds are heard] Why do I have to feel like this? [hears scribbling sounds] And what is that noise?! Grrr! Eh. [squints] [turning off invisibility] Yeah, yeah. Just act like I'm not here. [gasps] Are you spying on me?! What?! No, of course not! I was observing you—for research. [sighs] You're a threat, Flame Princess. Your emotions are directly linked to your combustion levels. But if I can create a scientific model that describes your complete elemental matrix, I can isolate and suppress your more... volatile traits. So, if you do your research, you'll know how to cut off my emotions so I won't feel like this? Umm, yeah, basically! Then I'll help you. You will? Yes. I'll do whatever it takes. [talking into microphone] Once I press this button, you'll be subjected to a battery of tests to gauge your reflexes, stamina, and your reaction to various emotional stimuli. This is going to help me understand myself? There's a 40% chance we'll be able to identify and isolate your chemical components—and yes, understand you in a very scientific way. Oh. That's good... I guess. Initiate test. [a phone drops down and knocks her hand away from the button] Yah. [puts phone to her ear] Hello? Princess! We need you and your Ball Blam Burglerber right away! Gunter has created a race of strangling snow snakes, or snow-a-constrictors! Aaaah—[gets disconnected] Okay, Cinnamon Bun, all you have to do is write down the numbers that appear on this monitor. Can you do that one thing? Yes. Oh, one other thing. Do not open that door. [points to a door behind Flame Princess] So that's two things write down the numbers, do not open that door. Got it? Yes, Princess. [laughs] Hello. Hello. You look sad. Yeah, but mostly I'm confused. Ha, me too. Really? Yeah. Bubblegum is bad. She is?! I don't know. Wanna pet my dog?! He lives at my house. What about the tests? I'm not good at tests. La-de-da-de-da [hums] His name is Jake, but he's not the real Jake. [walks into coffee table, leaving a notch in his leg] Ow. My body is soft. [extends leg toward Flame Princess] [gasps] [shakes his leg] We're friends. Yeah, I really get you, but sometimes friends are hard to understand. Sometimes you think you know them, but you find out they're just playing mind games. Is the princess your friend? I don't know. Yeah, because why did she lock you up in jail when you were a little baby? That was a weird friend thing. [gasps] The word! The word! What's the word? The word is your newborn baby will have greater powers than you'll ever dream of. Uh... have my baby sent into the wilderness of the outside world to perish. Okay! [runs off] Oop. Hup. [helps her walk] Ah! [catches up to her and picks her up] Aw. [makes baby noises] [tickles her face] [giggles] [her flames intensify] [sighs] Hmm. [starts crying and runs off] Ho-ho! [puts Flame Princess down and starts sawing wood] [gasps] WAAAAAAAAAH! [laughs] [runs into the forest, burning trees] Bah. [knocks down a tree, behind which can be seen the Candy Kingdom in the distance] Ca'tle. [looking through a telescope] What's this? Kih, kih. A princess? Must've wandered off. Flame King? What do you want, princess of the Gum World? I found your lost daughter. I-I don't remember losing anything. Pssh. Okay, you got me. I had her sent to wander in the woods. I was in fear of being usurped. Come on. That's your problem, but you can't just let her run around the woods. She's too dangerous. Find some way to contain her power, or I will. Pssh, fine. [stands up] [groans in frustration] Is everybody in this world hiding something? It's fun to hide. You're all right. Why can't everybody be honest like you? Maybe I should just go back where I belong. Wait, do you mean baby jail? I don't know, man. Mmmm... Fighting snow-a-constrictors really helped take my mind off things. So, uh, why am I here again? Oh, I just wanted to measure Flame Princess's reaction when confronted by the guy who broke her heart. Hey, Cinnamon Bun, I'm—[gasps] CINNAMON BUN!!! There's a note [reading it] "Gon 2 fyr kingdum. Pleez watch dog." Oh, this is terrible! If Flame Princess goes back there, her evil dad will lock her up again! And if she's imprisoned, I won't be able to complete my tests, and I'll have wasted my precious time! We gotta save her. Let's doogie! State your business here, and be quick about it. Sorry, I'm on edge 'cause I'm worried that Jerry here will find out I'm dating his sister. Listen, we need to get into the castle right now. Yeah, but why? Grrr! So I can go to your mama's house! Now get outta my way! Doesn't your mom live in a nursing home? Yeah, and in a different city. C'mon, dude, you gotta be honest here. Honest my fist! [punches Flame Guard, pushes him down, and headbutts Jerry] Come on, Princess! D'aw, yeah! Gonna scramble you and fry you up for brunch! I try to act tough but I really wanted to be a chef. Man. Halt. What is your business here? I need to get inside to file my taxes. Also I like using the bathroom here. Also I like to crop dust the lobby. Pass, friend. Alright, so you wanna get nasty? One time, I blew a snot bubble that broke off and floated away. Then it hit some lady's baby in the face, and it started crying. And I really enjoy the taste of envelopes. Uh, that's cool and all, but you still haven't told us why you want to get in. We need to see the king? Well, why didn't you just say so? Right this way, friends. [leads them inside] There you go [Flame Princess is seated on the throne wearing royal garb] the new Flame King. Flame Princess? Finn? You're okay! Um, how's it going? Pretty good. Cinnamon Bun and I staged a coup and I overthrew my dad. Oh-ho, that's why the guards were wigging out. That is the new way in the Fire Kingdom. Total honesty is the law of the land—no secrets. Oh. [from inside lantern] Right, can you believe this nonsense? Once I get outta here, I'm gonna ground you for real. No snacks, no friends, no popular music. You never let me have any of those things! You were a selfish king and a bad parent! But I did it for you, honey—for you not to overthrow me like you just did. You belong in that lamp! And if you don't settle down, you'll have to answer to Cinnamon Bun! [wearing a conical fire hat] Hi. Wow. She's even awesomer than I remember. Take off that silly hat. We're going home. No. Look, [pets Jake 2] got a real dog now! Hah. Flame Princess, listen. I'm really sorry I lied and hurt your feelings, and I was a big fat jerk— Finn, it's okay. It's in the past now. So, does that mean we're still going out? No. I've realized my place is here, ruling these weak and vicious Fire People. I see. [gets on the ground and goes into fetal position] But we're cool. You're welcome to come back and hang out whenever you like if you promise me one thing. [stands up] Anything. That you'll be completely honest with me. Heh. Okay. I promise. [laughs lightly] I'm serious. Hmm. Honey I'm home! Oops. I forgot I lived alone. Well, no bother. I won the Golden Shovel Award. [turns on the light] Candy Kingdom's premier award for grave-digging excellence. There. Now to hang up my tuxedo so it doesn't wrinkle. [gasps, discovers that hangers in his closet are missing] You're missing hangers, too? Well, I don't really use hangers. Have you considered folding? We better call Princess Bubblegum. And then I called you guys. To find all the wire hangers? Wouldn't you rather have us fighting evil demons or something? Maybe an evil demon is stealing all the hangers. Hmm. [shapeshifted as a trashcan] See anything? [inside Jake] No, it's pretty quite out there. Yeah, but not so much in here. Huh? What does that mean? Oh, Jake, no! Wait, hold on. It's over, Ice King! Oh, hi, guys. What's going on? Is kidnapping hangers your new thing now? Yeah, man, you have, like, one muumuu, and you're wearing it. You think this is about hangers? Really? Well... Yeah, because you're stealing all the hangers. You're stealing everyone's hangers, dude. It's about so much more! Come back to my place, and I'll explain everything. Hmm. See? I dropped my keys down this deep hole. I need all these hanger guys to help me snag 'em. When I'm done, I'll return them all, and that's an ice promise. How long has this crack been here? Forever. Before forever. What the... [pulled down to the crack by hanger] Oh! Something's got me! Let go of the hanger! Huh? Let go! Oh. This calls for an investigation. All right. Stand back! [forms a circular saw with the power of his ice magic] Follow me, fellas! Watch your heads. Holy moly! Do you know what this extra square footage means when I decide to sell? [looks into the icy orb]There's something in here. What is it? I don't know. Well, no rest for the sexy. That's not the expression. Boy, this is strong. A lot stronger than my ice. [grunts] [gasps] Dudes! Hello. What year is this? Uh, nobody really keeps time like that. It worked! I mean, I feel like it worked. This is the future, right? Who are you? You're like a beautiful Ice King. Oh, boy, here we go. Back off, son! I saw her first! Chill, you guys. [chuckles] "Chill"? Get it? I'm I'm Hello. Who's a good boy? Ahem. They call me the He's been using his powers a lot today. [jumps off the boat] Hup! Well, I think you're pretty groovy. Do you wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna be my acolyte? Sure. What's that? Like a boyfriend? More like an intern. Oh. Uh, no, you're right. It is more like a boyfriend. Cool. YOU'RE COOL! Dialed in, you know? [chuckles] Huh, what? Yeah. Uh, hey, this might be a weird question, but do you know where the slime, candy, and fire dudes are? [whispers]She's talking about the princesses. [whispers]I'm starting to get a weird feeling. Oh, you must mean Slime Princess, Princess Bubblegum, and Flame Princess. [intrigued]Princesses? We're like this! That is so fun. Okay now, this next request may sound super sketch. Okay. I need you to round them up and bring them back here. Like, even if they don't want to come. You think you could do that? Are you kidding? That's in my wheelhouse, right up my alley! Classic So, wait, is it in your wheelhouse or up your alley? Classic Hold on a minute. You can't make Simon start kidnapping princesses again. Yeah, he's semi-reformed. Excuse me for a second, boyfriend. Okay Jake--- Wow, you got their initials on there, and look at those shapes. We're kind of like a power couple. Get me those princesses. You got it, boss. Wait, wait, wait, wait! Look, Jake. [Jake turns his head toward the Citadel] More guardians. The Citadel, I presume. Likely so. Hey. Do you think maybe one of them could be my dad? Eh, I don't think so. We'll probably know when we see him. Right, right. That makes sense. Hey! The Lich again! This must be where the prison cells be at. See? Good riddance, too. I hope you rot forever, you awful jerk-clapper. Some people just make the world a worse place to be in just by being around, Jake. [The Lich starts to breathe gray smoke through the pink crystal.] That's right. Bad apples. Lock 'em all up, I say. At the bottom of the ocean, where it's too dark to see. Look at that weird ol' kid over there. He looks just like you. [It closes up on Finn's father.] Man, look at his clo— Daddyyy! [ [He walks towards Finn who is still on the floor.] Well, it had crossed my mind. [He groans while slapping his head across his face, then gets up from the floor.] Jeez, man! Now I wish I hadn't said all that stuff before. Now my heart feels yellow and green. [He makes an angry sound while clenching his fists in the air, then he exhales.] Maybe we shouldn't even have come here—waah!? [Jake is beside It wasn't me! It came from up there! [referring to The Lich] He's melting the crystal all up! [It zooms in on the Lich than other prisoners as Hey, kid! [He starts to blow on the crystal that's burning on the crystal close to his hand.] Hey, do me a favor. Get me out of here, huh? [Finn, bearing his teeth, goes to help his father.] This fire smells crazy! Thanks, kid. Now, where'd you guys park your Star Skipper? [As Finn's dad speaks, the guardians fire off their lasers to obliterate the criminals trying to escape. One guardian has fallen in the line of duty and is falling into the depths of space.] This place is coming down quick, and I mean quick, like zip zip. Like wow, like boom boom wow. Oh. We... we don't have a Star Skipper. [turns back into his dog form] Also, Finn'ss your son. Whaaat? No Star Skipper? Ahem! I said, Finn's your son. He came a long way to meet you. Son? Oh, hey, good for you, kid. In other news, I still gotta get out of here and the ground is melting. Huh? [He pokes at a pink circle that has formed in the center of the Citadel.] It's all pooling in the center. Hey, um... I... I wanted to ask you something. I... well... [ [coughs] [gasps] Aaah! Gree-nah-gah-ga-ba-ga-ga-da-da-ga-ga. [laughs] [looks around] Finn, I know we normally come out of these things okay, but I got a bad feeling about this. Just promise me, if both my eyes get fried off, you'll fry yours off too. What? No. [He gets up from the floor] Listen, you don't gotta worry about a thing, Jake ol' pal. [He points upwards] We just need to defeat those five space villains, hijack the shard they're hijacking and sail it home to safety. [Jake looks upwards.] Easy peasy. Yeah, Jake, smarten up. As soon as the last guardian dies, the fighting stops. See? He's bitin' the dust right now. Aahh! Uh oh! [he says it 15 times] It's-- It's okay. It's okay. [Finn continues then stops.] You just gotta fetch me a gob of that guardian blood, son. It's got that good nooch that keeps us young in the crystal. Nooch? Come on now, partner. [breath] No dawdling, yer old man needs ya. [winks] [sighs] Atta boy, Flynn! Do it for yer old man! Yeah, yeah, just get right in there! Don't be shy. Yeah! Hey, good job, son! Now, rub some of that sap on my leg there. Make sure to get it into the chicken wing hole. [shudders] Dad...  Okay, M-Martin. We need to talk. Yeah, okay, kid, but hurry it up. I'm trying to act cool here, but this thing really stings! Oh... I mean... Heh. You know me. I'm a funny guy! [groans unhappily] Ahhh, I dunno. It was a long time ago. [ [sighs] But hey, daddy's back! [grunts] [ Dude!! [ It's time to peel bananas on this fool, as a family! [In unison, Jake and [Swimming away from the island Finn and Jake are at.] I gotta run to the store! [annoyed] Hrm. [An explosion throws [ Finn, forget that loser! Dad, wait! Hey, cool guys. Looking for a new boss? [They look at him and then he winks at them. As Finn climbs up the shard, one of the criminals, a centipede, starts to cut at the shard Finn is climbing up.] Chew faster, that guy's really moving. [grunting and disappointed] Dad! Stop! [He glances over at the Lich, then he sees Finn in danger.] Finn! [He takes an arm and throws it to help Finn.] [shouting] Martin, I won't let you escape! [ Finn! Let go! He's not worth it! Oh, gross. Pedal to the metal! Hey, what about air—? It'll be okay, dude. [sighs] I mean, at least you finished off the Lich, right? Oh, yeah, that's the good news I didn't have to! One sec. [He runs behind the large piece of crystal.] Up you go! Check this out! [Finn is surprised, Over here, fellas! Next stop, the Candy Kingdom. Previous stop, this weird place. Mr. Pig, I think we should get a d— [whispering] Okay, run. Go, go, go! Oh! [She hugs Mr. Pig while also spilling his coffee. Mr. Pig is smiling.] Oh, this changes everything! Hello! [laughing] Stop, demon! Get back here, I say! Ha ha, nowhere to run. I, the great and powerful Urgence Evergreen, command you to freeze into a million pieces and leave young Foolish demon, you leave me no choice. Zap, zap zap zap zap! What? No, Nina! You're supposed to be frozen. Nina! Nina, the portals! The Elementals are gathering! C'mon, you blockhead! I just think we should discuss this, Evergreen. "Discuss"?! Are you listening, Chatsberry? Once this comet hits, everybody dies. Not just everybody, but us, but us! Now, now, hold on, Evergreen. Hath not a comet impacted our world every thousand years with no lasting grievousness? Ahh, but this, Balthus, is no ordinary comet. Behold! See how it writhes? It aches for our extinction. It—! But Evergreen, even if the comet is as dangerous as you say, what can we possibly do? We build a crown. "A crown"? Like none seen before, or ever after! A magical crown whose phantasmal circuitry will bond to its first bearer and grant him his one deepest wish... [yelling] to destroy the hideous comet which threatens our world! The good news is I already built the crown. The bad news it needs a power source. [yelling] The enchanted Ruby Eyes of the ancient lava dog, Magwood! And that's where you come in. Wait, wait! Evergreen, please. Wish Magic is really the real deal! This wish may see things in you you cannot see yourself. Can you truly say you know your heart's truest desire? I'm with Chatsberry. If this comet hits, we four indeed may perish. But the Elements we embody — Fire, Ice, Candy, and Slime — will live on! But a misplaced wish could cause irreversible damage to the very structure of existence! Well, that's just great. What about you, Slimy D? [begins rapping] Yo, yo. My name's [interrupting the rap] Slimy D stands with us. We reject your plan, Urgence Evergreen! Very well then. You leave me no choice. Ingrate! Hmm! Doom you to no doom, maybe! [yelling] Gunther! [Gunther pokes his head out of his hiding place.] Pack my things, Gunther. We ride forth with Mount Magwood. You get to watch me save the world! [Gunthers eyes turn to hearts] Gunther! [His eyes return to normal] Come on, Gunther. Get your head in the game. Sorry, Master Evergreen. [His head ducks out of his hiding place] [sighs] And he expects me to teach him the ways of magic? As if. [stepping on rocks] Ouch! Oof! OUCH! Uh, Master Evergreen? Can I ride on the palanquin with you? My feet are soft. [beat] No, you're right. Ooh, boy... [points at comet] Gettin' fat. [yelling] Gettin' fat, right? Hmm. [reading scroll] However, I would suggest this is still a nice night. It's quiet. Hmm, it is quiet. Why don't you put on some music? The chimes, Gunther. Okay. Gunther! I said "chimes"! Gunther, no! [throws sand at Gunther] Sorry, Master, I'll put him back. Heeeeey! Mmm, what? Oh, never mind. [rolls a jar towards Gunther] Here, take the jar and find me some water. There's not enough moisture in the air for me to make an ice camp. Uh, Master? I'm sorry, I don't think I've seen any water at all today. Just do it. Don't anger Daddy. Wait, are you my father? No, but I stole your egg and mutated your brain—get going! [goes back to reading scroll] Hmm. Heh, you don't know where you're going, do you, girl? [Gasps] Ah, you're good at this. [The water pouring from a tiny rock structure that is low to the ground.] Man, you know who I like? Master Evergreen. He can do anything; one thing he's gonna do—he said he's gonna teach me magic. I can be like him! Nina, no! Master Evergreen, I found the water so you could build a—oh, [sees ice tent and hears a sleeping Evergreen] I guess he also found water, too. [Gunther takes blanket] Heeeeey?! Now, Gunther, listen to me. Don't follow me into Magwood's lair or else he'll melt your dome! [Disappointed] Yeah... [pointedly] Oh, Gunther! You should see this! Okay! [Taps his nose] Gunther, no! You failed; he'll melt your dome. [to himself] Not as grand as you once were, eh? Master Evergreen, I'm sorry, but I got worried. Yeeeee!! Ah! Oh, boy! Uh, maybe maybe maybe, maybe I can do magic! [Looks at his hands] Like Master Evergreen. Bah! Ice! Flah, sorry... [He steps back only to trip over the same skeleton as Evergreen. This again catches the attention of Magwood.] Shh! That's what you get! [Magwood approaches and roars. Lava shoots from his mouth and lands on the imp, melting him] Heeeey.... [With Magwood distracted, he shoots a large block of ice.] Ice! [And then freezes the creatures head and quickly runs to the top. He stabs Magwood's head to obtain the jewels.] [Now walking away from the volcano, a frustrated This is why I don't teach you magic. [Petting a sleeping Nina] Niiina, Hiiina, Iiiina, Fiiina— Gunther! The heck are you doing?! Get in here, Gunther! Oh, there you are, you blockhead. Quickly, take your position. We have precious little time. Once I complete the bonding chant, you deactivate the force field. [Gunther gives a thumbs up.] Bonding, bonding, three two one, you can do it, you can do it, three two one, bonding bonding. I did it! I— [A pounding sound comes from the doors. An angry Magwood, now in igneous rock form, appears. Gunther?! Gunther, can you hear me?! [Groggily] Yeah—yes, Master Evergreen! Okay, good. Now, aiming at the sound of my voice, throw the crown so it lands right on the top of my head. I—wait, what? No, no, there's no time! It must be you, Gunther! Me? Don't worry, it's easy. Even a mush-head like you couldn't donk it up too bad. Just focus on your deepest truest wish, the destruction of the deadly comet, and the rest will take care of itself. [Places the crown on his head] My deepest truest wish... [Darkness overtakes him]  Marceline, no! Don't let anyone read my diaries! Burn them, Finn! They're embarrassi—! [screams] And then he said, "Fine." That's the story of how I met your dad. Can I play now? No, Marceline, Sweetie. It's nap time. But I don't want to sleep! My dreams are weird. All dreams are weird. But, Mom, my dreams are we-e-e-eird. [chuckles] Honey, something weird might just be something familiar viewed from a different angle. And that's not scary, right? [voiceover] Hello, Marci. I don't know if you'll ever hear this message. I fear my thoughts are no longer my own. Just watch over me... ...until I can find my way out of this labyrinth in my brain and regain my sanity. And then maybe, Betty, my princess—maybe you will love me again. [sighs] Please love me again, Betty! [sobs] Okay, bye! [takes out tape and pushes over camera] [sighs] Hey, Simon. I, uh, finished packing your gear. So can I have my tape now? What? No. This is private, silly. [tucks tape into bag on sled] There you go. Snug as a bug. Seriously, Simon. Please don't go. I... I have to protect you. How can you protect me if you're not even here?! I'll arrange for someone to come take care of you. I'll make sure he doesn't leave. Please, Simon, I could help you with this. Yeah, maybe one day you will. But until then, you have to stay brave, my fearless Marceline. Ouch! You see? I have to go now. Goodbye, Marci. [hops on sled and leaves] What? No! [chases after him] Wait! Ugh! [trips and falls in snow] Simon! Simon! Yah! Ew! [𝘩𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘴 𝘥𝘪𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘯𝘵 𝘭𝘢𝘶𝘨𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨] Okay, I know you're here. Peek-a-pop! [Laughs] The fool! You found me, Marceline! Now you're it. Bzzz, bzzz, bzzz, bzzz. The waffle doll shall fall lest you eat the yellow dough. [injects Jake with syringe] Bzzzzz... [flies away] [stops humming] Hmm. [rubs eyes] I'll... I'll finish this later. [yawns and lies down] So tired. And also hungry... [rubs belly] Maybe I should... eat some— [starts snoring] Huh? Uh... [touches yellow grass] Huh. Hmm. Everything's made of... me. Pretty neat. I bet there's, like—like a cool city or something around here. Nice. Hi! Oh, uh, hi! Jake! How you doing, Jake? [waving] Uh, good, man! Good! Man, this place is awesome! [approaches a storefront] Ooh! [looks through glass] Cool dolls! They look like the rare antique kind. Maybe my kids will like them. Mm. Wonder what my kids are gonna have for dinner. Maybe pizza... Whoa-oh! Some kind of Eh? Is that Jake? [turns around] Hey there, um... C'mon, man! It's Oh, uh, of course! Goose! Aww, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, ya big goof! How long's it been? Two, three years? Let's see, uh... [counts on fingers] one, two, uh... I've never been here. [laughs] "I've never been here." You've still got it, Jake. [fake-laughs] C'mon! Let's get you home. Everyone's waiting for you at the party. Eh—party? No. Par-tay! [laughs] Do it again, Goose! [laughs] Hey, Jake. Hey, what? Now that you're back, how 'bout that five bucks you still owe me? Uh, what five bucks? Cheeseburger cheesecake ring a bell? What—? What is that? Oh, oh, that. Don't worry about that. Do not—don't worry about that. [thinking] Guess I'd better not worry about it. [aloud] Hmm. I'm hungies, Goose. I think there's a leftover nacho basket or something in the fridge. [leaving] Just a sec. [gets food from the fridge and returns] Cold cut-and-nacho sandwiches! All right! [takes a bite] Ow! Something's wrong, Goose. Mr. Jake! Mr. Jake! Mr. Jake, the Mayor wants to see you straightaway. Alright, lad, show me the way! [follows Urchin] Jake! Hey, I got a for-real important question do you like cereal in your cake? Jake? [pats him] Hmm... [shrugs and smiles] Mm-mm-mm. Mr. Mayor. Urchin, thank you for your help. Help yourself to the herring cakes. Right-o! [shaking Jake's hand] Hello, Jake. Thanks for making it. Heh. Okay. Now look, we're at orange alert here. Below us are gathered the city's top minds. Hmm. And they've noticed that our seismographic troubles have increased exponentially since your arrival. Mayor, uh, I want to meet these minds. Here are some of the minds. Jake, we want to perform some tests on you to discover the cause of the quakes. There's no need. I've got it figured out. The tremors are happening because I'll prove it! Huh? Mention a food item. Omelet. What's in the omelet? Chili! It's a four-egg chili omelet! Watch out! Analysis, Tim! It's too early to say; this evidence is anecdotal! Look, just let me stretch outside to get something to eat, and the quakes will stop. That doesn't sound very science-y. No, but you have my permission to test your idea. I don't like that idea. Huh? If Jake leaves, that would mean the utter destruction of our world. I believe that Jake is an extra-dimensional being, a Glob if you will, whose psychic field holds our world together. If he leaves, his flesh will reconfigure, and everything and everyone here will disappear completely! Oh, Erik Adamkinson, you're just a fringe scientist, well known to have a crackpot of crazy theories. Hm! Perhaps I am. And maybe I am wrong... but are you really willing to take that chance? We should imprison Jake immediately! What?! No way! The world's not gonna end just because I go get a bagel. Seize him! Uh, peace! [grows in size] Why?! Finish him. [sadly] Mm. [longingly] Bagel. Don't worry, everybody. I will journey to Jake's Glob world, which, legend would have us believe, lies beyond the great sky-hole, and bring back the food of the globs to appease Jake's appetite, thus saving everybody. Wait! Wait! [hugs Erik Adamkinson] I want to go with you, Son! I-I'm sorry, Dad. Y-you can't; i-it's too dangerous. Your mind is unprepared. My son. [weeps] Huh? [grabs balloon] Yeah! There it is, the sky ho-o-o-o-ole! Phew! Oh, my stars! It's just as I envisioned! Almighty Jake Globs, I beseech your aid! Do you have bagels? Hello? Hmm. Maybe those aren't the true globs. Yeah, they're too ugly to be— [gasps] [screams and then weeps] I thought you'd be beautiful. But you're not! [cries] You're hideous! Hideous! [melts into Jake's body] [points to projector] BMO, resume. Spaghetti... [stomach rumbles] Don't! Huh? Hey, you're a le— [sighs] Huh? Goose? Go. But—but what if Erik Adamkinson is right? What if you and all the Then you won't have to pay me back that five bucks. But— Go eat, Jake! Uh, Jake? What's going on, man? Feeling okay? [eating beans] Just getting a snack, Goose. [sheds a tear] Just getting a snack. And as it waded through the carnage that it had wrought, the vampire smashed their skulls just for the fun of it! No way! Yes way, it did. And also the vampire hunched over its victims and breathed their vaporized blood mist. Ah, jeez! Jake, is this stuff you're saying true? Or are you just trying to mess me up? You have to be honest. Oh, it's true, man. I heard it through a reliable source. Reliable? Rats! Yeah. Some say it haunted this very tree! This tree?! [ominously] Good niiiight... Jake? You're full of it, Jake! Errr... [he hears croaking and sees a worm on his bed] NO WORMS ON THE BED! [Hits worm with the Enchiridion.] Huh? [Lightning crashes, and the figure's scary face is seen] AAAAAH!!! [Runs downstairs] Jake! Jake! I saw someone outside the window! It must be the vampire, and I think we're unprepared, so I-- Relax, buddy. I made that story up. I was just trying to scare you. But you said you heard it from a reliable source! Ha ha! I made that up, too. I was trying to scare you, and it worked! [laughs] No one's outside. Whew! It was just the wind, scaredy-cat. I wasn't scared, I was singing. I was singing my scream song. Ahh! Ahh! AAaah-uh-aah! You're a total wuss, man. Hey, guys. What's up? I'm [afraid] Are you gonna smash my skull and breathe my blood mist?! Don't suck our blood! [laughing] Calm down, weenies. I'm not gonna do that. [Lights candles] Soooo, you don't suck blood? Sometimes, I do. But it's not the blood that I like. It's the color. I eat shades of red. Ugh, I am exhausted. I've been traveling all over the Land of Ooo. And I've seen some stuff that would really make you say "like what?" Like what? I encountered a school of goldfish beasts. [A flashback of And I fooled around in the Fire Kingdom. [A flashback of OOO! Oh, and check these out. [She has nuts in her hands] Nuts? Oh, these aren't ordinary nuts. [Squeezes the nuts and they become little creatures. One squirts Finn with ink.] [laughs] You're wonderful. Um, yeah. Thank you for not sucking our blood. You guys seem cool, too, but as you can imagine, I'm really tired, so you two should probably get going. What? [sighs] Look. [She uses psychokinesis and moves a picture frame and reveals an "M" carved into the tree] "M" for " Aw, man. I carved in this tree years ago. Way before you two rascals started squatting here. [Flings them out] But seriously guys, thanks for keeping the place warm for me, I mean really great! Good night! Come on, Finn. Let's get out of here. She can't kick us out of our house! Finn! Get down here, lady, and fight me! She's a vampire, dude! I'm gonna kill her. Dude, if half the stories I've heard, and/or made up are true, vampires will kill you. There's no question! But, what about our home? A VAMPIRE TOOK IT! Aw, we should go house-hunting. Bag us a new house. But I like our home. Finn, house-hunting is wild! You've got to try it. Really? Yeah, man! It is so nuts! You always know what to say. Bla-bla-bla-ble-ble-bla-bloo-bloop! (laughs) Okay. I'm convinced. Let's roll! Sweet, things are gonna start going our way. [Clouds separate to reveal the sun] Hey, look, see? What'd I tell ya? This is weak! I don't even like any of these places. I wanna go home. Finn, let me tell you a little something about what home really means. [plays viola] La, la, la... [singing] Home isn't a place, let me give you a clue... Home is anywhere, where people care about you... I don't wanna hear a lecture, dude! I just wanna go home... [singing] But, home is where your heart is, Finn! And where is your heart, Finn? Well, it's right here inside you when I'm sitting here beside you! [talking] With your lucky stars to guide you from above. [They look up, a star floats around, then poofs and disappears] Yeah, I guess I'd rather be out here, wrapped in your ear, than be in some awesome house all by my... souse. I'd rather be dancing with some babes! [laughs] Shut up, dude! Ew... Gross. This place looks gross! And abandoned. [Echoes] [gasps] Whoa, bro... Wanna just live in here? Yes. So whaddaya think, man? We did pretty good for ourselves. Yeah, we did... So, ah, what should we do first with our new digs? Let's trash it and throw a party! Ah this is it, feelin' good, I'm feelin', I'm feelin' like we did it. I'm feelin', like, completely satisfied. Nothin' else could go wrong, ya know, Jake? Yeah, man. Aww, yeah, I know, too. Hey, Finn. She's back! Wow, pretty awesome party ya got here. What do you want, Marceline?! Oh, I just wanna show you somethin'. This cave belongs to me! What!? Thanks for fixing the place up for me. Y-You can't take our home twice! [With guitar] Yes, I caaaannnnnn! AAAAAAAHHHH! It's vampire-fighting time! Finn! Nooo! Vampires will kill you... remember!? But she's taking our home again! We're home as long as we're together, bla-bla-bleep-bla-bloop, remember!? Oh, yeah. Okay, Marceline, I'm gonna let you keep this cave, but only because Jake is my home, and he's way better than all your homes combined! Ya know, you're right. I guess I'll take him too! [yells] What!? I'll bite him a little, maybe turn him into a zombie. Nooo! Let go of Jake! Make me. You okay, pal? [transforming] No one... makes me... let go... of Jake! I'm not scared of you! Finn! [laughs] You're pathetic, little boy! [grunts] You're pathetic! [Spits] Get ready for an uppercut, you dog! Make me. [Slaps Finn's butt and laughs] Bleh-bleh! Blah! I've... gotta help my buddy. Your blood is mine! [warbles] [screaming] Jake! Uh oh. [Screams; runs up to her and punches her in the face] Ow! That actually hurt, Finn. [laughs and kisses him on the cheek, making him blush.] Why didn't you just kill me? 'Cuz that was fun! I haven't fought like that in years! Thanks, Finn. Finn! Aren't you dead? Naaah, before she bit me I used my powers to shrink all my guts and blood over my thumb, see? [Does so] [Clears throat] You two are pretty hardcore. I can appreciate that. Soooo so does that mean we can have our old house back? Yeah! Keep it, as a gift from me. Blaeargh! Yeah! Huh? Did you guys get on the bed? I told you, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED! Oh, hey, guys. Come here, friends... Hug me... wawawawawawawa... Aw, yeah, hug me... wawawawawawawawa... [gasps] He's heading for that cube. Come on, Jake. Oh, yeah. What?! What happened?! Hey, hey! Did you guys see that? You know that was a ghost wearing a dead guy? That might be the nastiest thing I've ever seen. Na-na-na-na-nasty! Nasty jazz! Nast-- [Almost like beat boxing] Hey, hey! Easy, buddy! That's our friend Billy! He got possessed by the Lich! [Finn looks very sad and Oh! Sorry, sorry! I didn't mean nothin' by it! I mean, I have a lot of nasty friends. My uncle is nasty. I'm basically honorary nasty. [Jake stretches them down to the floor] Do you know where he went? We have to find our friend. Who knows? [Depressed] Uh. Oh. Actually, it depends on the wish I granted him. "Wish"? [Hastily] Yeah, he wished for the extinction of all life and I did it. I guess it changed his timeline or something? Whoa, wait a minute. How can that be if I'm still here kickin' it with my main man, Finn? Oh, that's because you're safe in my time room until you make your wish. [They pause to think] Ohhhh. I wish that life wasn't anymore extinc— [ Oh yeah. Jazz. Hmmmm. [Thinking] Hmmmm. I got it! I wish... the Lich... never... even ever existed! Mom? Mom, what's wrong? [Holding Finn's Baby Brother and looking concerned] Finn, I need you to do something for me. It's very important. [Jake barks] I need you to take the mule into town and sell him for as much as you can. What! Sell Bartram? [Bartram sits up in the bed in the corner] But, I love Bartram. What the heck, Mom! Shhh! Finn please, just do as I say. [She looks out the window concerned] [Muffled by the distance] Got it? [Looking out the window, Finn sees a group of “stylish” thugs harassing his dad] Dad? I push you, you fall down. [ The Destiny Gang? Everything will be fine, Finn, I promise. Now just do as I say. [Walks away] [Finn is now outside near the fields sitting on a tree root] [sigh] I'm sorry, Bartram. I guess Dad must be in real trouble to be doin' this. But, I bet there's a lot o' fine folk lookin' to buy a good mule. Why, I bet I could even come visit sometimes. Won't that be swell, Bartram? [Looks around and sees that the mule is gone] Bartram? Dang it Bartram! Bar Bar! [Finn walks through some bushes to find Batram in a dead tree] What the- Bar Bar, how'd ya get up there? [sigh] Whoa! [Finn falls through some bushes and into an underground cave. Jake follows. There is a frozen missile with a dead man under it] Jake, look! Golden crown! Unbelievable! We can sell it and keep Bartram! Bong, bong. [Finn reaches for the crown] [She comes out from behind the missile and cocks her gun] Hold it right there! Who are you?! I'm a thousand years old and this is my crown! Okay, okay! But, um, maybe I could just borrow it for a little while. [Finn reaches for the crown again] Noooo! No! Noo! This crown is magic. Bad, terrible magic. Too dangerous for mortal fingies like yours! [Marceline has a flashback of Simon walking onto a hill to watch a squad of bombers.] One thousand years ago, my beloved friend Simon Petrikov gave his life to save this foolish, unworthy planet from annihilation. [A scene shows a mushroom cloud amidst a decimated city and a gang of demons surrounding the Lich walking away from it] A frightful bomb was poised to bathe the land in mutagenic horror, [Farmworld Simon is show directly below the bomb using his not yet complete powers to freeze the bomb in midair] but using his mastery of ice and snow, Simon froze the bomb in mid-flight only inches from the ground, where it remains to this very day. [We see Marceline in the cave again] Today, ever ripe and ready to blow. [We see Farmworld Simon being crushed by the bomb] But he alone was not saved. Trapped under the giant weight of the enormous bomb, poor Simon perished! [In the flash back] Little help? [Farmworld Simon is seen dead and the crown is firing laser-like beams of energy] And the horrible crown, grieving its lost master, loosed a spasm of magic so wild and crazy the entire earth was buried in ice for four hundred boring years. [First we see a city being frozen almost instantaneously and then we see the earth covered in ice. The flashback ends.] Uhh, none o' that is true, 'cause magic is fake. Daddy says the false prophets of old used cheap parlor tricks to control the people. [Farmworld Jake is growling] And to get babes. Like 10 or 12 hot babes each. No! Magic is real! Lady! You been down here too long! Why don't you, just let me- [Finn goes for the crown again] Step off! Or I will use this! Lady! Quit it with that thing! [Finn reels back and Jake begins barking again] I'm sorry. You must DIEEEE! [A laser beam is fired from the gun] WAAAAAAAAAAaaaaah… ooo… uuum… [The laser is ineffective and passes right through him] Oh, man! This thing! Dang it! [She hits it] Go, Jake! [Jake jumps at her as a distraction while Finn grabs the crown] Aaah! Go back to the underworld, ya beast. [She throws the gun weakly towards Jake] Sorry, gotta save my dad! [They exit the cave] Destroy the world more like it! [huff] Dummy. I give up. The crown. Go get it. I know you're not really talking to me. I'm not crazy! Get the crown! Go get it! [huff] Get the crown, Marceline! Go get it! I can't. My knees! Oh, that's really disappointing I must say. I'm just—uh, whatever, you're really letting me down right now. Okay, alright. [farts] [Finn is auctioning off the crown at the Junktown market] Cool crown! Who wants a cool crown? I found it on a dead magician dude! I'll take it! Awesome! How much cash ya got? Ohhh, I'm poor. Uh, but what about I trade you for a personal concert at your house? I'll come over later and sing ya like, four songs. I mostly do covers, but I have originals too. Do you own any spoons? No. Let me see that! [He takes the crown] Hey! Heh! [gasp] [Finn has a flashback of the D gang harassing his dad] Wait, Destiny Gang. I gotta sell that to pay you guys! Trami, what you think? Is it my style? Big Destiny will know. Yo, boss! [ Snap! Huh? What is this? [He turns around] Are you tellin' me what to wear, Trami? No, boss, you look good! [He is sweating] You think I should reinvent my style and put a stupid thing on my head?! No, man! You tell us what to wear! Otherwise you would dress like an idiot! Bam! Crown shorts! [Big D puts the tip of the crown in his extremely short shorts] Amazing! [Everyone begins clapping.] Yeah-ha-ha! Clap harder, trash bag! [He pushes down an old man who begins silently crying and clapping faster] Okay, you guys. Gimme my money and leave my parents alone. Property of old dead person go to Big Destiny. [ I guess it wasn't really mine. [Tromo drops his apple] It's mine! I'm a demon... half-demon. Tromo! Jack up crazy lady! Trami! Take mule back to crib for din-din. Whaat! [Trami hits Finn in the face with his hammer knocking him off Bartram. He lifts up Batram and takes him] Bar Bar! Tough luck, One-arm! [He and Big D jump onto a ski-lift-like pully system up to their mansion] See you soon, bad-style Junktown! [Big D laughs evilly] Bar Bar. [Finn is about to cry] End of the road, bat lady! [He kicks over Farmworld Marceline] Oh, my bones! Haha! Ah! [Finn sticks his flute up Destiny gang, get outta town! We're sick of bein' bullied around! [Everyone cheers] You make biiig mistake! Especially you, One-arm! [He backs up to the lift and leaves] My name is Finn Mertens! And tell big D I'm comin' for my stuff! Ohhh, you come n' try! Are you okay, lady? You must promise to—promise to return the crown to its hide-hole. I promise. You'll need this Finn if you want to win. [He shows Finn a sword attachment for his robotic arm] Choose Bruce, what is it? It's a weapon for your arm. With this you will defend from harm. [He replaces his grabber arm with the sword arm] Feels natural. Like peeing outside. Sort of. Best not to take the lift my friend, else the D gang'll see ya comin' in! No. I want them to see me. I'm-a go up there AND SHOW THEM MY FACE! [Finn rides up the lift and kicks down the door and runs in] Yaaaaaaaaaa-huh? Hello? [He doesn't see anyone, but hears Bartram bray] Bar Bar? I'm comin'! Bar bar! [He runs into the room, but Big D trips him on the way in] I want my stuff, ya big dump! [He charges Big D, but he is easily beaten] You want Big D's crown, huh? Yeah, and Bar Bar. Here ya go then. [Hands him the crown] Wha? That is your final possession, the last thing you will ever own. What do you…mean? [He walks over to the window with Big D] Look down there, stupid. [gasp] [The town is on fire] Town is on fire! See? I made it on fire! Fix up Junktown! Look at old man cry! [laughs] That's what happens when you mess with Big D! You get crushed! Your family get crushed! Booya! [We see the Destiny gang throwing torches everywhere and Choose Bruce crying] Suck my shirt! [Finn, throwing off his sword, slides down the lift with Bartram and rides up to Choose Bruce] Choose Bruce! All my stuff is gone! Now they're goin' after your home! [He is crying still] Bar Bar, come on! Hurry, Finn! You can win! [Still crying] Finn! Return the—whoa! [While continuing to ride Bartram, he lifts her on] I will, but we gotta stop the Destiny gang first. Come on Jake! Good boy! [Jake is trialing them] Destiny! Destiny! Destiny! [Finn's house is on fire and the D gang are chanting] Noooo! Yeah! How did I even get here, son?! Nooo! [Finn's family are up stairs, trapped in the fire] Fiiinn! Mom! Dad! [He reaches into his pack and pulls out the crown] You said this thing is magic? Yes. Powerful and dangerous. But you lost your mind in a cave. Whatever. You just gotta believe me, okay? For serious, ya donk. I am Big D! Wooooo! I believe you. You do? [He puts on the crown and begins yelling in shock] Wait! Noooooo! Dang it! Aaaaaah!! These ghoul dudes take the form of whatever you're thinking about. An angry -- no, shy shark baby. What if life was always just constant fun times on the river? Let's never do anything boring ever again. Yes, let's never do anything boring ever ag-- [ Aw, come on! He's just gonna read those weird stories that are basically about us. I kind of dig getting loosely adapted. Fionna spoke with the voice of an angelic choir. "You can have the rest of the screaming chili cheese dip if you want," she said. [Sniffles] "It's totally fine." The end. [Slamming the book shut] I said "the end"! Let's get some questions. [Raising hand] Where do your ideas come from? They're beamed into my melon at night - same as everybody else. Next! I have more of a criticism than a question. [Angrily] I am very open to criticism! Your story was completely wrong. [Looking for the source of the voice] And how would you know? I know... because I am... Fionna! I can show you what really happened. It's all on this tape! Ooh! What format is that? According to this map, we're very close. There's the door. Aw, it's locked. I'll get us in with key... eye! Bam! "Eye" got it. You get it, Fionna? Yeah, but it's a stretch. [Quietly] There I am. [Sighs] Next time we find a map lying in the backyard, we should think twice. At least we get this fancy coffin. How's it look? It's a decent addition to the treasure vestibule but still kind of a letdown. You know what's never a letdown? Cookie sauce review party. Yeah! Cookie dip. Screaming chili cheese versus sriracha ranch. Was it real? Who was filming all that? Wenk, wenk. Needs more hunks! Dude, I literally have one bazillion questions. [He approaches "Fionna".] Uh, excuse me, Miss Fionna... Where did this video come fr-o-o-m! Fionna! I always knew we'd meet one day and become best friends. So, uh, remember that time when Cake caught Ruse Goose, the notorious goose pickpocket? That was such a long time ago. But during trial, you realized she was framed 'cause it was actually Abracadanielle pretending to be a goose all along! Can I also ask a question? Besties only. I was just gonna ask if we could see more of the tape. Oh, yeah, can we? I don't think so. All right, just a little more. Oh... my... glob. It's a mummy! That's right. I'm a mummy! Aww. Yeah, you are. And a real cutie, too. I'm not cute! I'm horrible! [Groans menacingly.] Wanna hang? Okay, that's enough. Aw! I want to see more. I don't want to wear it out. It's my only copy. And it's very important to me. Library closes in five. [Flicking the lights on and off] Click, click, click. So, where you heading now? Guess I'll go back to the dump under the bridge where I live. I'd invite you over, but I don't have a sofa or TV or anything. It's literally a dump. I have a TV. My crib is equipped. Oh, really? Hey, you should move in! Please live with me, Fionna. This is the sweet spot. My roo-- [Noticing mess] Oh! I wasn't expecting guests. [Chuckles] Not that you mind a bit of dirt, right? Nice, huh? So, this is my room now. Only the best for Fionna. Oh yeah, I like this room too. It's where I do all my deep thinking. Man, I still can't believe it-- the Fionna in my bathroom, touching my toothbrush, throwing it into my little trash can. Fionna taking charge! That's what heroes do. You're a so much better hero than Finn. I know. Plus, don't tell Jake, but I've always been more of a cat person. Where is Cake the Cat? [He begins calling for her.] Cake? Cake? Cake is gone. Some years back, there was an adventure mishap. I don't feel comfortable talking about it. Oh, okay. Hey, you still haven't shown me where you keep your Fionna and Cake tapes. Sorry, no can do. What? Don't you have tapes? Oh, yeah, I got loads of tapes, but they're super private. Maybe you'll change your mind once you see more of my mummy adventure? Yay! I'll get snacks. [Groans.] Hey, what's wrong? [Dramatically] I have... a curse! [Together] Oh no. How can we save you, tiny mummy? The curse can only be broken by strong black coffee and fancy muffins from Breakfast Kingdom. I know that place. It has a really long line on weekends. Yes! That sounds like the one. Be a hero and fetch unto me the sacred breakfast. Don't you worry, little guy. We'll save you! Okay, that's the end of the tape. Really? My stories usually get wrapped up neater. [Chuckles] Wrapped up -- mummies. Yeah, well, there's no more, so... [She removes the tape from the player.] You wouldn't know this, but old heroes need a lot of sleep. I did know that. See you in the morning. [Suspiciously] Okay. [Whispering] Fionna? You awake? I made you a midnight snack. [On the tape] Mummy, we're home. [Gasps] I knew it. Where did it go? Maybe it had to go back into its coffin Dracula-style. Mummy? We got you breakfast. Hmm. Shh! What's that? Nyeh! That's our treasure! Stay away. You'll get cursed. [Groans menacingly] I take the curse off of me and put it back on you. You understand nothing of mummy curses! [She flees.] Our treasure! Our muffins! Uhh... Do not look upon a naked mummy. It's bad luck. [Together] Queen of Ooo?! That's right. I snuck in here to pretend to steal your stash and teach you a valuable lesson. Never invite strangers into your home, no matter how cool they seem and are. You should be thanking me really. Of course. She didn't want me to see the end of the tape because she's not Fionna. She's... a mummy! [ Come on. They're all just him? Imposter! Reveal yourself! [He begins swatting "Fionna" in the face.] Aah! Knock it off! You're the knock-off! What? You're not Fionna! How did you-- Show me your true form! Aha! Huh? What kind of mummy are you supposed to be? No kind! I'm just an old lady. Who likes to dress up as Fionna? It makes me feel confident, okay? Plus I look really good in this outfit. [Narrating a flashback] Look, I used to be very shy, tinkering with my tech stuff all night, sleeping all day. But one evening, I intercepted a strange signal. I was mesmerized. I watched that tape like a hundred times before I finally stepped out of my cave a new woman, determined to find more Fionna and Cake. I roamed Ooo for years with no luck. But then I found out about you, and I hatched a plan to steal your tapes. What? I don't have any Fionna and Cake tapes. I know! All of your tapes are filled with embarrassing diaries. If I met them, I'd definitely record it. Fionna and Cake aren't real, you ding-dong! They're just, like, a TV show from the past or something. You're the ding-dong, lady! You tricked an old, defenseless Look, I didn't mean to hurt you. You lied to me. Fionna would never lie -- never. Oh, glob, you're right. I'm not like Fionna. I'm the mummy! Oh glob! [She exits.] Wenk. Huh? Well, that was disheartening. [In the distance] Forgive me, Fionna! [Echoing from the light beam] Cake, what time is it? Wenk. Throw it, Cake! Eyahh! [Kicks it to the ceiling where others are] These Jelly Kinders aren't... alive, are they? [Holding one] What? No! They can't even talk. Kick it! Thanks for helping me out guys. What are these boogers for, anyway? Oh, they're decorations for my Biennial Gumball Ball. Tonight! Sounds like it gonna be large. Yes! So very large. I'd like you to be there as my special guest. You want me to go with you to the ball? Heck yes. As my pal! Oh. Right. It starts at seven, so don't be late! Fionna, we got trouble! My tail is totally frizzin' out! I'll check it out. It's Ice Queen! The Prince shall be mine! Back inside! Outta my way, tomboy! Ice Queen, why are you always predatoring on dudes? Ha! You should talk! Keeping all the babes to yourself, totally ice-blocking my game! What? Not [Forms a slush beast around herself] this time! Gah! Slush Beast! Cake! Morning-star mode! You saved me from the Ice Queen! Oh, uh, yeah I guess. Is she gone? She must have fled. Fionna, you're so strong. And you look so beautiful in the snow. What are you doing later? I was just going to go home, I... Come with me. Let's go out. Go... out? Yeah. Let's go somewhere. What? We'd love to! Great! Meet me in the castle gardens in an hour! [Dragging a stunned Fionna out of the room] Yes, we'll be there! Oh, it's a date! No, it's not. I'm sure when he said "go out," he meant "go out," not "go out!" Shut up, he's into you! Come on, you heard what he said. I'm like his guy-friend. Well, that could change tonight. If it's a date, why are you coming? I'm coming to help you! Hold on, I'm bringing my dulcimer. [groans] Man. It's a conversation starter. [Puts dulcimer on her back] Fine, I'll do this if only to prove you wrong. Mm... Let's just bail, I changed my mind. No! No retreat, girl. Hello, Fionna. And I see you brought Cake. That's cool, right? Only if it's cool that I brought... Lord Monochromicorn! Hiya, gorgeous. [In Morse code] H-E-Y. Accept these tokens of our esteem. [Awkwardly] Hey you didn't have to, guy... Nonsense. For you, Cake, a satchel of nepetalactone. Mo-Chro picked it himself. Catnip! Sweet babies! [Starts tapping the bag against her head] And for you m'lady, a bouquet of posies. Oh, uh, they're... There's a surprise at the center. Huh! A crystal sword! I'm all about swords! How did you know?! I pay attention to things I see you being all about. Thanks dude. It's just...WOW. Come, for the wowiness has only just begun! [Whispering] Psst, Fi, tell Gumball that you think he's HAWT. [Whispering] What?! No! [Whispering] Guys like to hear that they're hot! [Whispering] Will you keep your voice down?! Oh, Fionna! Hey, what's up? I thought we might have a little race. A playful race to Marshmallowy Mweadows. Okay, but I'm gonna kick your butt. [Awkwardly] Not that I'm thinking of butts... Excellent. [He and Lord Monochromicorn take off] After him, Fionna. After your man. [They take off] [Breathless] Good race, Fionna. Why are y'all breathless if we're the ones running? Gumball! Sorry, I saw a pearl pygmy skull in there. It reminded me of you. The way your eyes sparkle. [ Fionna, there's something I want to tell you. Oh, my gosh, dude. That was, like, the stupidest thing ever. See you back at the tree house. [Winks to Fionna, Fionna blushes, as Jeez, I dunno, I thought about it, but I think you could wear your pants as a shirt, if you really needed to. [Laughs] Okay, okay, now you ask me something. Oh, um, is this a date? ['Laughs] Fionna, come to the ball with me. As your chum? No, as my girlfriend. It was a date! There was singing and junk! I know! I was there for that part! Cake, he wants me to come to the ball as his girlfriend! Oh, my goodness! It's almost seven! You need something to wear! Oh, hold on honey, I am gonna make this happen! How am I supposed to fit my weapons in this? It's a ball! You don't need weapons! [Puts the crystal sword in her purse] I'll take my retractable sword. Okay! Lets go, go, go! I've been looking for you. Well, here I am. Ha ha! Hey, I wanna show you something. Okay. [Goes with Prince Gumball] Okay, girl! I'll see you later! What? Hey, is this your bedroom? Fionna. [Unbuttons his shirt and walks towards her] [Backing up] Heh... whoa. [A drip of water falls on This was so much easier than I thought it would be! [Shoots ice lighting at Fionna, she dodges.] This is really messed up, Ice Queen! WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM WITH ME?! [Ice Queen causes an ice pillar to grow under You're what stands between me and my Gumball! [Spikes come out of the ice pillar and tear into Fionna's dress. An angry Fionna rips her dress free and jumps off of the pillar.] I can't believe I fell for this trash! You got me to show up with a dress! And a pur— [in realization] My purse! My sword! You like my ice sword? Get it off me! Fionna! Oh, my goodness. [Fionna puts him down and Cake bursts through the door] WHAT'S GOING ON IN HE— [Sees Prince Gumball with his hand on Fionna and her dress in tatters and rushes towards Prince Gumball] AAAHH! Don't you touch her! [She jumps up and flails and scratches on his face until Fionna pulls her off] Shhh... It's okay, it's okay. It was the Ice Queen. Paws off my prince! [Groans and snarls] My magic tiara... my powers! And this is for yanking my heart guts! [Punches Ice Queen to the ground where Cake, wearing the magic tiara, blasts her with snow.] Ha ha! I'm a queen! [Fionna knocks off the tiara] No, you might catch her crazy. Wow, Fionna. You're, you're just really incredible. Maybe we should meet up, for a date. [Pushes him away] No way, man. Not interested. [Thoughtful sigh] I think the reason I got all these guy-friends and no boyfriend is because I don't really want to date any of 'em. I don't need feel like I'm waiting to be noticed. I know who I am. And I'll know what I want when and if it ever comes along. But there is one guy I would do anything to date. [In a smitten voice] The Ice King! What?! Me, too. Ice King's the real deal! Ice King is the hottest hottie, and I can't wait— [The camera pans into "—to marry him!" said Fionna. Then she turned to Prince Gumball and said, "I hope Uh... [threateningly] Tell me you thought it was good! Uh, it's good! It's good! It's really good, dude! It was amazing! Hmm? Oh! Hello there! Bayble navel! It’s great to see you! Here for more graybles, I reckon. Well, alright. Just like last time. [Like in Star Trek, the window doubles as a digital screen] We’ll watch five separate stories, each relating to one special theme. [The visualizer is divided into 5 sections like a food pyramid. Each section with a picture representing each chronological grayble] Guess the theme by the end of the episode and you’ll be the freshest mint-whistle! [laughs] Now, look to my visualizer screen and let this exciting grayble dribble all over your mind-label! [laughs] [Fade into first grayble] [ [Jake blows off the dust to reveal a nursery rhyme book] Messed. Warlocks, dude! [ Yeah, I’ll try it. Could always stand to feel better. [ [ [ [They look around for something to happen] I don’t feel like a good boy. You sure you read that spell right? [ Wanna keep stickin’ our thumbs in stuff ‘til it works? Yeah! [They high five with plums on their thumbs] [They burst out the barns doors] Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I! [Sticks his thumb in an ant hill] Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I! [Sticks his thumb in a bird’s nest] Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I! [He pokes Lady’s baby bump with his thumb and Lady kisses him] Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I! [Sticks his thumb into a tree. Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I! [Sticks his thumb into a flower] Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I! [Sticks his thumb in a bottle] Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I! [Finn is holding a chipmunk’ arms up and [ No, I don’t. Hey check out that gross toad! [There is a toad with holes in its back with baby toads hoping in and out of them] [They walk over to it and start poking the holes with their thumbs] Oh-what-a-good-boy-am-I. Good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy. [Finn and Jake talk over him] Gross! Ahahah! Cut it out! Quit stickin’ your thumbs in my back! Ahhhh! [Marceline is hovering several feet above them, watching.] Yeeeaaah, I don’t know. [She pulls out her map and flies forward] Uhhhhh, jeez! I’m never gonna find this place! Hmmm. [There is a rock giant playing drums up ahead, but instead of drum sticks, he uses his massive fingers. [The giants finger bursts through [The giant pulls back his finger, but [Finn and [Tree trunks has a pie on her back as she meanders along] La da da la da da mmm deedle dee... [ Oh! He he! Boys. Your manners. [Tree trunks bumps into a statue and her pie falls] Oh! Whoops! Oh! Hey, Tree Trunks! Excuse me sir. I wasn’t looking where I was- Tree Trunks! Up here! [ [Tree Trunks is with a [She is wiping away tears] Yes thank you. I-I heard a man calling out to me “Oh Alright, ma'am. [He pulls out a pen and paper] Let’s see. How do you spell your name? “T...” Okay. “R...” Okay. “E...” Okay. “E...” One sec. “E”! [She is mad] Hold on oone second. Uggh! I’m sorry, but the wheels of justice spin too slowly! [She storms out of the door] I’m going to have to take the law into my own hands! Thank you all for coming! The police have failed me in my time of need! So I’ve brought you here together. A posse! [She hands the Gumdrop Lasses pantyhose filled newspaper] I made you all blackjacks [Police batons] in case things get…uuugly. I stuffed some of my stockings with balled up newspapers. I made a big one for you, because you’re so strong. [She hands one to Cinnamon Bun] Alright then! [They are swinging their “blackjacks” patrolling the street] Let’s clean up these streets! [She falls on her side and kicks her little elephant legs as helplessly as possible] Oh there he is! Oh my goodness! [They run past Tree Trunks and start hitting the “Cranky Cookie” statue] Weeeee! [grunting] [The banana guard comes up] Oh. Why. It’s just a statue. I-I-I don’t understand. I-It was so rude before. [Cinnamon Bun is in the background wearing his “blackjack”] Hey Tree Trunks! [ Oooh! Hey! Tree Trunks! How are you! Sheeelbyy! Have you been up there all day? Yeeeeesss. Just readin’ this book. [Holds up book] Uhh, well can ya read somewhere else? Ya kinda offended Tree Trunks here. [Looks around and finally understands] What? I-uh. Uh. Oh. Oooh! [laughs] I get it! [laughs] [laughs] Wonderful! [Shelby crawls away and Ice King is seen flying in the background] [The [Now we are at the Tree Fort] Poor Football, you’ve come so far, but still have so much to learn. [BMO is talking to his reflection in the window] But I don’t understand BMO. I’m a real baby girl now. I can smell the reddest lilacs. I can hear the screaming squirrels! Screaming for nuts! Oh my gosh! I can’t believe it’s true! No, Football. That’s not enough. You have to learn manners too. Otherwise, you’ll be all alone! Alone? But-but what about you BMO? I will not always be here to protect you Football. No, you must learn. Here look! [Pulls out grapefruit spoon] This is a grapefruit spoon. It is only for eating grapefruit. [Pulls out a salt shaker and shakes salt into the air] This is a salt shaker. Here, you try. [ Like this? [Does not have pinky out] Yuck! [giggles] It’s bitter! No, no. Football like this. [ Like this? No, like this. [ Like this? [Both BMO and Like this! [ Like this, right? No Football. Do it like- huh? [ [Finn sighs. Finn and Jake walk up the ladder to find [Sounding depressed] We stuck or thumbs in almost every hole today. But we never felt like good boys. I know a thing or two about good boys. Why don’t you try sticking your thumbs in these holes? [ [He looks at BMO’s fingers] Controllers? [He looks up to find a video game start screen called “Super Good Boys”] Haha! Oh yeah! Super Good Boys! [They use their thumbs to push the buttons through BMO’s fingers] Bawmp! [The characters in the game start picking up trash and cleaning the digital house while BMO giggles] So, did you guess the theme? Go ahead and pause your viewer now if you need a few more glayble to think about it a little. [A “pause viewer now” card appears for a second] Oho! Now you’ve got it! I can tell! That’s right, the theme is the five tastes. [For each example, a still from the corresponding grayble appears] You see, Jake ate a SWEET plum. Marceline played some SAVORY licks. Tree Trunks had a SOUR taste inside her mouth. Oh my. Gunter wanted to drink the SALTY tears. And Football's tea was BITTER. [He laughs until he supposedly hears something] Huh? What’s that you say? You thought the theme was the five fingers? [he laughs] Don’t be silly! No one’s had five fingers for twenty blablillion glaybles. Five telepathy glands maybe. [he calms down] Ah… slimmin’. Well anyway, looks like it’s that time again. [waves goodbye] I’ll see you crimpy glimmers on triode flimpin’ the diode! [he laughs as the screen cuts] [Turning to the viewer] Hmm? [Laughing] Oh, greeble bayble grapes. You're just in time. Bayble Okay, BMO, [we'll] be back in an hour. You sure you don't need anything from the Grocery Kingdom? No, I don't need anything. Thank you. Okay, goodbye, Finn and Jake! Bye, BMO! Yeah, see ya later, BMO! Finn? Jake? [Talking to reflection] Well, hello there. Oh, hello! Who are you? My name is Football. What's yours? I am What the...? See, man? I told you. This is nuts. Plus, he's usin' my toothbrush! No, man. That's my toothbrush. [Beat; the two look at each other] [In disgust] UGH! [Reading to-do list] "Prove that BMO does weird junk when nobody is around." Check! [Checks item off list] High-five, buddy! That was pretty weak. Yeah. I was thinkin' the same thing. You wanna give it another go? Yeah. That was better... but we can do better. You mean even better. Let's back on up and run at each other! Okay! [Voices crescendoing] Aaaaaahhhh.... [Their hands meet thunderously.] ZAH!! Ooh, kinda stings! I like the pain. Let's do another one. Ready!? Yeah! Jake! Yeah? I know how we can do the most ultimate high-five ever!! You've gone crazy mad with power lust! And I'm lovin' it!! [Talking on walkie-talkie] You ready to do this, dude!? [On speaker] I've been ready this whole time, dude! Just waitin' you to say when you're— SUPER-ULTIMATE HIGH-FIVE GO!!! Ugh... A glass of delicious, nourishing water for my lady— [Princess Bubblegum knocks the water away] AAH!! [Exits] [Frustrated sigh; she stares at her paper and gasps.] Oh, yes! Oh, man... Uh... oh, boy... [The machine activates and spins faster and faster as the cow screams louder and louder. The centrifuge powers down.] Ugh... Oh, my Glob! Oh, Glob... Cheeeeese... Ding ding ding ding ding. Ha ha! Jingo-jango! Yeast on third, flour on first, swell the dough, fit to burst! Awhoooooo! [Exhausted] Well... this is it, Cinnamon Bun. The most perfect sandwich that has ever existed, or ever will exist within the confines of space-time. Will you do the honors? Okay. [He takes the sandwich and places it directly into his stomach.] [Flabbergasted] But... but you... you didn't... y-y-you didn't even... taste it... Thanks, Princess. Peace out. Blegh, Gunter, something stinks! [Sniffs penguin] Gunter, do you smell that? [Penguin continues playing] GUNTER, STOP PLAYING THE KEYBOARD!! [Notices something and sniffs around] Smells like it's comin' from... [Sniffs penguin] Gunter, are you blowin' it up in here? [The penguin just stares] You are nasty, Gunter! You got a nasty booty, mister! Nasty! [The penguin looks down in shame.] Oh, don't be sad, stinky. Come with daddy and I'll make it aaaall better. Goodbye, Gunter. Sorry, sweetie, but I'm never gonna get any princesses if you're stinkin' up the place! [Goes back inside and sniffs] Blaaaah, it still stinks in here! What the heck! Where's that smell comin' from?! [Sniffs armpit] Oh, it's me. I smell horrible. Scrub, penguins! Scrub harder! We are not stopping until the stench is completely gone! [Whistling] Clean clean, clean ka-clean. [Whistles some more; suddenly the penguin from earlier is seen and is dripping wet.] Gunter! Guess what? It was me who was smelly, not you! [Angry] Wenk. Sorry. I thought you had a stank booty, Gunter. My bad. Although I have no idea how my armpits got so stinky. Everyone's worthless at this talent show. I'm totally gonna win when I sing, [Singing] "These lumps! I know you wanna slump up on these lumps! But you can't 'cause you're a chump! A chuuump!" You're totally gonna win, LSP. Thank you, Marc. You made two out of ten baskets. Now it's time for me to kill it! Hold on, LSP, you're not up next. These girls are. Wha—THAT'S MY SONG!! That sounds good in my eardrums! [Beat] [Frightened]...These lumps. I know you wanna slump up on these lumps... Hey!! We just heard this song!! No... I... I was gonna do it first! [The crowd continues to chant] NO! NO! RIP-OFF!!! I WAS GONNA DO THE SONG FIRST!! Huh?! Whooooaaaa... That's amazing! Huh? LSP! LSP! That was the most amazing thing ever! LSP wins!! Really?! Oh, my gosh, you guys!! I just wanna thank y'all so much! It means so much to me! And I just wanted to say I... I... Finn and Jake win the talent show! WHAT?!?! [Out of breath] Awesome... [Panting] That... was... awesome... [To audience] Oh, bayble, that was easy, wasn't it? Slimmin'? I'm glad we all guessed the theme so easily. What? You haven't guessed it? Oh. I'm sorry. Well, pause your viewer now to think about it before I belayble it to you. [The scene pauses momentarily.] The theme was the five senses! You see? Look. BMO saw his reflection. Finn and Jake touched their hands together! The Princess made a tasty sandwich! The blue guy smelled bad! And the other thing heard music. Oh, what a treat! Okay, well I'll see you trimpy flimmers on triode flimpin' the diode! Get back here, worm! What?! The last chapter of "Cosmic Kissing"? My stirring lyrical interlude from "Fionna Goes to the Market"? The epilogue from "Flame Prince Breaks a Sweat"?! [ Gasps ] Who gave you permission to edit my fan fiction?! Prepare to be punished! But first... what'd ya think? Wenk! Great critique! [zap] Wenk. I don't need an editor. I'm my own editor -- editor-in-king! Ooh! My custom tape! Remix! [ Clears throat ] "Sunlight gleamed through the window as Fionna sat patiently at the breakfast table." [ Humming ] Hah! Check out my sweet flippin' moves. You're a real ace in the kitchen. Roar! Ha ha! Cooking is fun! Here come the flapjacks! Know what's better than cooking? No! Wha?! These are narrative flapjacks. Darlin', don't you see the brilliant comedy laid out before you? You wouldn't eat Act II before Act I, silly. Now try starting with the dockworker having a moral crisis. Okay. This...one? Fionna, this character doesn't serve any thematic purpose until much later in the meal. Sorry, Cake, but these just look like formless blobs of sweet flapjack to me. Mmm... It's true. Maybe if I based them off real people, do some "life cooking" -- nonfiction flapjacks! Let's go griddle up portraits of the entire kingdom! Got to get my supplies together. My portable griddle... Mmm. Some peppermint eggs... and the twice-cursed flour! Got it! Ready for stories and flapjacks? Heck yes! You're wasting me on breakfast! No one asked you, Flour Demon. That was like a cookbook... written by a genius. On to the next chapter -- "A Game of Gumball." Prince Gumball would probs make a great flapjack model. Sometimes he gets so absorbed in his work that he doesn't move for days. Ooooh! I can break out the pink sea salt and -- Hey, there's Gumball! [ Papers rustling ] Is it here? No. No. Ah! Just what I need! The periodic table of candy elements! If I use this one and this one here... Ha ha! The perfect strategy! Hyup! [ Inhales sharply ] Butterscotch Butler, the butterscotch Scottish butler, I challenge you! [ Sighs ] Again? I've gathered all the necessary strategy and tactics to finally defeat you! To play, one must know strategy, yes. But to know victory, one must also know their opponent! Opponent? Their dreams... ...their ambitions.... ...their rrrregrets... ...and their fears! M-My mortality! King me. Maybe we should find someone a little more relaxed. How?! How did you know?! Huh? Oh. You leave that lying around everywhere. Yes! Still not quite right. How about this for some inspiration? Pancakes and flapjacks are nothing alike! Aw, Cake. It's just that flapjack literature is such a niche genre, and none of my flapjacks are turning out any good. Come on, Cake. We've still got 10 minutes before the library closes. It's Flame Prince! What's that fire hazard doing in the library? Hmm? Oh, no! Oh! I love that author! Have you read her newest book? I-I could, uh, find it for you. Oh. Uh, n-nah, that's okay. I'll just start with this one. Thanks, though. Uh -- Aah! Oh. Sorry about that. Uh -- Uh -- W-w-w-- W-w-w-- Eh... No, no, no, no, no! Hot, hot, hot! Wow. I am not graceful today. N-Not the first editions! Ow, ow! Ow, ow, ow! Easy... Unh! Gah! Huh?! Leaving, yes? Yeah. I'll borrow this one, please. Of course! I'll just need you to sign it out. I'm sorry. I have a duty to serve the library's patrons, but I'm also sworn to protect the books. I can't in good conscience let you take it home. But maybe I could read this book to you? Listen, I just came in here to use the bathroom, man. I thought you had to, like, check out a book first to pee. Actually, I don't even have a library card. Lumpy Space Prince! Lumpy Spaaaace Priiiince! Come on. You've been coughing for five days. Just take one tablespoon. Uh... B-Bumpy Space Prince? Uh, there's no one here by that name. Then who am I talking to? Uh, this is Ja-- Jack. [ Coughs ] Huh. Well, if you're Jack, then I'mmmm... MMMMichael Dean. Yeah. And I'm looking for this beautiful prince. I got to give him this...magic potion! See, he was cursed by this evil snot gnoll. Really? The snot gnoll transformed him into a totally disgusting mucus monster. What?! No, I'm not! Did you hear that? Huh? What is it?! It's -- It's -- [ Roars ] It's the snot gnoll! Aah! Uh-oh! It's coming towards your tree, Jack! I'm stuck! I'll protect you, beautiful prince! Step off, snot gnoll! Get him, Michael Dean! Gah! It got me! Ugh! No!! I got one last hit in! I-It's running away! [ Sighs, coughs ] I think this is the end for me. Rally, Michael Dean! [ Voice breaking ] It's...too late for me, beautiful prince. Take the potion. [Voice breaking ] Take it and live. Live! I won't let your sacrifice be wasted. [ Glug! Glug! ] See? No more coughing. Hey, yeah. Actually, I do feel better. [ Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! ] Wow. Maybe that was the wrong potion. Much better! Lounged atop their comfortable sense of ennui, Flynn the human being and Jacques the raccoon listened to the Ice President read his fiction. "Lynn the person looked at Janet and asked, 'Am I my feelings? Do I exist because I can't stop feeling?' Janet the fox answered her. 'Feelings are action, and like all mortal action, they are doomed to failure.'" Flynn and Jacques sighed. They totally got it. The end! What do you guys think? Too philosophical? [ Groans ] Out of my way! Blazin' blueberries -- comin' through! You're ruining my literary reading! Oh, hey, Ice Queen. Do you want Cake to make your flapjack portrait? Why, ye-- No! I mean no! Why don't we table this for now, so I can... destroy you! Hang on to your turkeys, because I'm about to make the toughest flapjack ever. Some purple chicken milk... dramatic cornmeal... And the tears of this reflective turtle. [ Whispering ] You will outlive everyone you love. Cry for me, little mama! Here, Fionna! Tasty! Hey, Ice Queen, I really liked your story. The imagery was tight. Can you bElieve it was my first draft?! No way! Gotcha! I call it "Portrait of an Author." [ Chuckles ]I really did like her story, though. I wonder how that Ice President got elected. Talk about life imitating art. Gunter, did you see what Daddy did? Did you guess the secret theme? Wenk! No! You're way off! Fionna and Cake were at the breakfast table. Gumball consulted the periodic table. Flame Prince set fire to the table of contents. The...purple thing had a tablespoon of syrup. And Ice Queen...did a tabley thing, too, probably. Wenk! They're not like regular stories. They're shorter. I'll call them...grabl-- No -- tables! Wenk. I'll never look at tables the same way again. BMO, I've been playing this 72 hours straight. Can I please save after this battle? No, it takes up too much brain space. [drowses and then wakes up] I'm out of candles. Huh? Man, if Finn were here, we'd be doing this in shifts. Oh, well, let's keep grinding. I cannot talk and run this game at the same time. [screams] No! [chills out instantly] Well, I guess that means I'm free. I live again! [sings "My Name Is ♪Maja's in a coma, and she might not wake up.♪ ♪I'm glad you got a friend now even though that's messed up. Take T.V. to the market to get him into fruits. Take a little nappy in my blanket cocoon... Wake up really early just to cook for my friends. Later in the field at night I thought I saw death. Made myself a boat, and I sailed with a whale. Took T.V. to the market so he could try kale. And some other stuff...♪ Ah! Nice song, Jake. What a crazy 2 weeks. I think I'm ready to hole up and go round tow on 'Age of Grinders'. But where's Finn? I need him on this adventure. Uh, well... Hold on. What? If you don't know, I'm not sure it's my business to tell you. Don't you dare, Shelby! Give up that greasy gossip! Word on the street is, Finn's been hanging with a new lady. Who the honk is it? I don't... Muscle Princess. It's perfect. I don't... Me-Mow, from the future! [gasps] Nobody knows. Finn's been keeping this on the super DL. Why? He's just trying to be careful this time. Oh yeah, I get it. But I still got to know who this girl is. Okay, just don't blow up his spot. I won't! Hey, Jake. Oh hey, Science Cat. Where's Sword Shark? He died of old age. Hey, are you gonna find out who Finn's girlfriend is? Who told you that? Word gets around, man. Not to me, apparently. Let me know the dirt when you find out. I won't! Huh? What's that? Sounds like a flute coming from above the canopy. Huntress Wizard! Stop! This isn't working, Finn. Dude. [screams] Oh, hi, Jake. What are you doing here? I wanted to check out your new lady friend, but I guess she just dumped you like a diaper in the dirt, bro. [sobbing] I'm sorry, man! I want you to have a healthy relationship with someone cool. That's so sweet, Jake. I love you, man. Me, too, man. Okay, I'm okay. But, dude, me and Huntress Wizard weren't together. We're just trying to conjure up the Spirit of the Forest with my flute spell. What the blood are you talking about? It went down like this. I was just minding my own business, in my new alone place I've been hanging out at. Hello. How are you playing like that? I don't know. I'm just making stuff up. Something in your notes has the quality of a powerful evocation spell. What spirit guides your hands? Tell me, or I'll put this up your nose. First off, I'm a great fighter. And especially agile when I'm nude, so good luck. Second, my flute improv ain't no secret. I let my grass hand do whatever it wants, which is usually sort of shreddy and busy. Let me see that hand! You're what I've been looking for. Looking for a dope boyfriend. No man. She thinks my grass arm flute playing could summon the Spirit of the Forest. I've been playing different songs for 2 weeks, though, and he hasn't shown up yet. Who's that, her ex-boyfriend? Uh, I guess they used to hang out, but maybe in some kind of mentor-student capacity. So my theory holds. You can still make this happen. Yeah, I really want to help her summon this dude. Finn, that's not why you're here. That's why I'm here. Come on. Let's make some magic happen. Yeah, my magic flute spell. Finn. I had an idea. Hi. I think the problem is your flute. We should make you a better one from a magical tusk, like the tusk of the legendary Thunder Boar that lives in these woods. I'm down for whatever if it helps. I'm also here. Hey, what's up? It's late. Why don't you guys crash at my place tonight? We'll start the hunt first thing in the morning. Ha-ha! I'm like your sleepover chaperone. Grow up. You grow up, you teen. So, yeah, here's the place. We got some nice soft dirt right over here. Pantry, in case you want a snack, bathroom. I got a console if you get bored, but it was a gift, but it was a gift, so I haven't really set it up yet. Night, boys. Dude, I think I figured it out. You can't summon the Spirit of the Forest 'cause you ain't playing that flute for him. You got a crush on HW. HW's just training me to live an ascetic life like her. Okay, I buy that for like zero seconds. Before we hunt the Thunder Boar, you should drink from this enchanted spring. It might give you crazy dreams, but when you wake up, you'll be immune to the Boar's electrical attacks. Let's roll those dice. Hey, dude, are you sure you wanna do that? I've had plenty of weird dreams... Oh-okay! That was fast. Welcome. I am Wow, dude, we've been trying to summon you for weeks. And why do you seek me? I don't, personally, but Huntress Wizard really wants to talk to you, man. Did you know that a wolf's eyes are on the front of its head? But, yeah, didn't you guys used to hang? Most predatory species are like that. This little buddy doesn't even know I'm here. Fella, I don't want to have a science talk right now. Huntress Wizard only sees straight ahead, eyes on the prize. Now, why did you really need to see me? Oh, yeah! Can you make me immune to electricity? [gives Finn Finn Sword] Here. Whoa. Now plunge that into your heart. And this will give me immunity to electricity? I'll do it. To help Huntress Wizard. How long was I out? Seven long harrowing seconds. Hold still. Yeah, fells fine. Great. Now we can hunt down the Thunder Boar. Oh, yeah, the Boar. Try to stay focused. Magic dog, what do you smell? Mostly, Finn, but also some kind of giant wild pig. There! Jake's joking. I smell fine. Good work. You just wanted a tusk? You could have asked! Oh. You can stop. He is not coming. He is gone for good, and I should just deal. Maybe if I played it a little jazzier, like, all syncopated? Hey! Why don't you tow try playing together? Use that chemistry to guide the music. Yeah, just get in there. Cozy up. I guess we've tried everything else. Wow... Who summons me with the sweet song of longing? Oh, hey-oh. Can you see me now? Yes. How's it been going? I've been talking to a lot of twigs. Where have you been, dude? I've been right here, but the forces that drew us close became obscured as you drifted into the lifestyles of magic city livin'. Attracting forces come and go. It's the way of the world. I still can't tell if you guys dated. But I'm ready to come back now. Are you, though? That's what I'm saying. Finn, who was your flute spell for? Um... I was playing my flute for you the whole time, but I knew you had a thing with this dude, and he seems cool, so I was just gonna keep playing this flute song about my secret feelings until my flute broke. I-uh, I worry that hard meat don't get eat. That is to say, if I ever find what I'm looking for, I'll become soft and I'll cease to matter in this world. What? Fear of softness is waht drove me to the mad and sad world of wizarding. And Finn... Yeah, what? My flute spell was for you, too. You're an exceptional beast, and you have great hair. But exceptional beasts like us cannot fall in love. That is the secret of ordinary people. Uh, that's real dumb. I agree. Wait, you agree with me or her? Take it easy, Huntress Wizard. Man, I can't believe all you can do is upgrade your armor in this game. It's all about patience and treating each grueling repetitive battle as if it were your first. Oh, snap! Finally! Whoo! Blah! What a bad and boring game. It was just what I needed. I'm sorry it didn't work out with Huntress Wizard. She just needs time to miss how cool you are. Attracting forces come and go, man. [All screaming and cheering] Whoa-a-a! That was awesome! Lets go over there! Whe-e-e-e! Come on! Come on! Wow! Yay! Whee! Whoa-a-a! Hmm. Why would I need to learn about caterpillar families? I don't get it. Well, they look like they're having fun. [Scoffs] Real leaves aren't made out of candy. They always have a gross, bitter taste. Whee! [laughs] Terry eats all the caterpillars! Mmm! Ah, it's so good! Ugh. That's gross, too. There's no way real caterpillars are delicious. You think? I bet they taste great if you're a boid. The caterpillar eats the leaf. Then the bird eats the caterpillar. Then the big bird eats the little bird. The big bird then dies, and its remains decompose into rich, fertile soil And from that soil, a new plant bursts to life. And then the caterpillar eats the plant again. And so the circle of life continues. This is a law of nature we call the food chain. Isn't that fascinating? Yo, Princess Bubblegum, do birds play football? No, Terry. They don't. [Sighs] That's weak, Ma'am. You guys, this is lame. No way I'm eating a bug's butt. Those kids are right. Whats the big deez about the food chain, anyway? Lets hit the snack bar and eat something yummy. Hey, this is pretty fun! Hey, have you noticed we are birds now? I'm hungies. Look over there. That oasis looks pretty good to me. Bon appetit! [Gulps] Oh, dude, you ate those?! Come on, man. We're sweet, sweet birds, and we get to eat worms. This is a unique experience. [Gulps] [Groans] [Groans] Uh, how did I get so mad chubs? I only ate one grub. Dude, you've been eating grubs for hours. What?! Yeah, you're a beast. Help me, Jake! My body's too bloated to fly! Hide! [Grunting] [Grunts] There goes my din-din. Why am I hungry again? Jake! Who are you? It's me, Dang, when did you get so big?... And old? [Stomach growls] You feeling okay, bro? Jake, we are good friends. So let me just say you look awesome right now. Ha, really? Yeah. You're looking tasty. [Muffled] Hey, why don't you take a seat in my mouth? Why? That's... weird. It's okay. It's okay. Just give it a try. It's a new experience, right? Wow, you have a lot of saliva. [Chuckles] You must have a broken pipe, old timer. It's comfy, though. [Chomps] Whoa! Did you just try to eat me?! No...? But if I did that'd be okay, right? You are trying to eat me. I'm just following the Law of Nature. What're you talking about? I don't know. I just feel that way. [Chomps as he tries to eat Jake again] [Groans] Aw, Jake, you're missing out... by not getting eaten... by me. Sorry, man. I'm not into it. So alone. So hungry. [weakly] The Law of Nature... has claimed this... bod... [Groaning weakly] Yay! What a big turnout. Top notch! To decompose stuff! Yeah-h-h! We are so pumped! Yeah! [Sniffs] What's that smell? Wow. It looks amazing! Yay! Yay! Party time! So good! Awesome. This bird went bad so well! You took it too far, man. I'm a dog, and I eat all kinds of horrible things. This is disgusting. Come on, think of it as a conversation starter—like, "The other night, I ate the grossest thing I've ever tasted." You know, it's interesting. [Gulping] Whew! I'm full. Whoa! Aah! Whoa! Aah! Whoa! Aah! What's going on?! Whoa! [Burps] [Laughing] [Panting] I think we're safe now... and also caterpillars. [Breathing heavily] We're still in a bind, man. No food, no water. I'm hungry. I'm thirsty. [Panting] Hey, look. It's another caterpillar. Huh? You okay? [ She's beautiful. She's just a caterpillar, dude. Looks like she's gonna faint. [Whimpering] You see? Huh. "Love is Blind"—that must apply to all species. Oh, I see. Your name is Erin, and there's a famine near your town, so that's why you're out here searching for an oasis. Yes, I have to hurry and find food. Otherwise, my family won't survive. [Weakly] But I don't know if I can go on... [Thunk] Hold on, Erin. Food! Water! Shade! Where are you?! Over there—the oasis! [Muffled] Yummy! Really? You like leaves now? So good, dude. [Gasps] Your eyes. Hey, hey, hey, move over a bit. I got a rhythm going here. I've never been this happy. [chuckles] [imitating Finn] This oasis is pretty romantic, huh? Sure, I guess. So, how many kids you want to have? Uh, [stuttering] d-d-do you want to get married? Yes! And will you, Finn, take this caterpillar to be your wife, even if she becomes a flower or a bird or a bacteria, to love and to cherish till death do you part? Y-y-y-yes. You may now kiss the bride. This way, Erin! Hey, is that my butt? Man, it's been a while! Finn! When we're reborn as caterpillars, I'll marry you all over again! That's beautiful, Finn! But when we're bacteria, I might see other people! Hey, why are you eating caterpillars? My eyes are open. The caterpillar eats the leaf. Then the bird eats the caterpillar. Then the big bird eats the little bird then dies and its remains decompose into rich, fertile soil. And from that soil, a new plant bursts to life. And then the caterpillar eats the plant again. And so the circle of life continues. Eh, so what? Let's go play. Yeah, weirdo. Football, you don't mean that. I do, BMO. I don't say things I don't mean. You look very smart and very handsome today. [blushing] Oh, Football, thank you. I love you so much. I love you, BMO. Ring, ring. [makes phone with hand] Hello? Football? This is Oh, hello, BMO. What a wonderful surprise. What's up? Oh, nothing. Just wanted to say that I love you. I love you, too. Goodbye. Click. Can I tell you a secret? Of course, BMO. You can tell me anything. I love you. Oh. [giggles] Now you tell me a secret, Football. I wish I could spend just one day on the other side of the mirror. Well, let's switch places for the day. Oh, BMO, you'd do that for me? Yes, Football. Because I love you. Oh, BMO. [grunts] [straining] Oh! [panting] Oh! [laughs] [in mirror] See you back here tomorrow, Football. [waves] Walking, walking, walking – hambone break! [ WooHoo! Hey! Get away from me. Quit it. [Laughs and blushes] Food for a beggar… Food for a poor old man? [Gets up off grass with a flip] Whoa! Geez Louise, guy So you got any, kid? Food? [Hand out in front of Finn] I got this little piece of sugar. [Thinks] Nuts, I'm freaking all about sugar. But I am even more about feeding hobos! [Clenches cube in fist] Whoa, man. Maybe helping this starving homeless guy is wrong thing to do. Why? I don't know. I said "Maybe" [Shrugs] A hero always helps someone in need and besides he's probably a secret elf who will reward us for being nice. Here you go, buddy. [Hands sugar to man] [snatches the sugar from Finn's hand and eats it] You know, believe or not, I'm not really a beggar. I'm actually a… [Reveals Himself] Magic [Stunned] Whoa! Aw, yeah! He's magic! I didn't expect this. [ [with eyes closed and shuddering] Think happy thoughts… Little, cute, bees, little babies, tiny, tiny bunnies. what is wrong with you, Magic Man?! You gave me that candy now I'll do you a favor in return. A magic favor. [Zaps Finn, blue dust cloud covers Finn] [Sings] A mystical, magical favor! [Finn's body starts transforming] [looks on worried. Finn is shaped like a giant foot, well just his lower half. His top half remains the same] Whoa, dude! ...For you! why did you do that!? Because on this day, a magical life lesson comes to you. No! Change me back. Not until you appreciate what a jerk I am. Wazoo! [ What a nutty guy What the heck, man?? What kind of deal is that? I help somebody out and they make me a stinky foot. [sniffs Finn.] You smell pretty good. [Shoves Jake away from him] Get off of me, man! I can't be a hero if I'm a big good-smelling foot! Maybe you're looking at this magic gift all wrong. Now that you're a huge foot you can kick evil's butt, like, way more times as hard. You're 100% kick, man! Why are you being so level-headed about this? Don't be a siss, Finn. Here, c'mon kick my butt. [ You're the SISS, siss! Augh! [tries to kick Jake but instead falls over, hitting Jake slightly.] [rubbing his butt] Ouch! oooh! Ouch. See, man. Let's give your foot body a shot. [still on the ground] No, dude! I wanna go find that magic man and get my body back! [ Ok, I will. Awesome! Dude you will never regret this. Hahaha! Okay, when the next monster comes along, he'll step on that trigger over there, sending your giant foot body into the monster's crotch! This sucks, dude. [Caressing Finn] Shhh! [Off- screen roaring. A two-headed monster comes into view.] We're evil! [steps on trigger and Finn is launched into its crotch, monster roars] Our crotch! our evil crotch!! [runs away while holding Finn's foot body in the air] Hahaha! What'd I tell you? You're a great hero! Let's go set up some more crotch catapults so we can laugh and be heroes. No, Jake. Let's find that Magic Man. Finn, being an enormous crotch-kicking foot is a gift. Don't scorn a gift. Town on fire! This looks like a job for foot Finn stomping ability! But I-I can't even bend these big fat toes, man. You can do it, Finn. What'd I teach you, dude? [unsure] Not to scorn the kicking of people in the crotch? You got it! Now I'm gonna go rescue all the babies in town [deep voice, face close-up] --only the babies. [Normally] Get your hero on, dude! Aaahh! Uhh. Okay, you can do this, [screaming] It's hot! Oh, man, I'm smoking hot! Please, help me out! I can't move! It's another one of those freaks! He probably started this fire! No, I didn't start any – Throw him under the bridge with the others! Get rid of the freak. [Chanting] Freak! Freak! Unh! [Sighs and sniffs] I'm not a freak, I'm a hero. Finn! Jake, how'd you find me? Oh, I can sense when you're about to cry. It's like a mother/daughter thing. [upset] I'm not going to cry, man! I just feel like crying. We have to find that magic guy and [Jake lets go of the babies and they crawl away.] get my body back now! What we have to do is find out what reeks under this bridge [sniffs] Jake! Ew, it's blocking out your good foot smell. Get back here! Ugh, it—it smells like vomit on fire. It's like fancy cheese in an old guy's mouth. Welcome, travelers. Ahh! I am Gork, leader of Freak City. Ah, I can see one of you has felt the Magic Man's touch. [Looks at Finn] Yeah! You know that guy? I will tell you all that I know. We are the accursed ones, all once normal guys and gals who crossed paths with the Magic Man. [ Do you have any orange juice? No. [Pause] Well, uh, I don't know. Maybe. Uh, I don't think so. I'll go check. Yo, Finn, this place is really bumming me out. Let's get out of here. What?! No, dude. These guys might be my only hope of finding the Magic Man. Hey, we actually do have orange juice. Thanks for being cool and all, but what do you know about this Magic Man? How do we catch him? Oh, he can't be caught. He's got magic and we're worthless freaks. We can't ever beat him. So we've gather here to wallow in our self-pity. But don't y'all even want to try? Eh, no. Why not? You're all totally miserable here. Ugh. It's a living. No, it's not, Zap! It's not a living! It's dookie diapers! I don't want to be a foot! Well, get used to it. We did. Yeah, Finn, maybe there's another lesson to be learned here-- To accept what fate has given you [puts his arm around a rat] and stay a miserable foot. Gork, can we stay here in this pile of trash and rats forever? Yeah, man. Do it up. [flops down in trash] Awesome. [Rats flock to his body] Here we go. Jake, stop screwing around. [slumps] You're gonna make me give into depression. [rats crawl on his face] Eh, what are you going to do about it? Probably nothing, right? If you're depressed, you'll do nothing. [Rolls over] I… [Depressed] Maybe I will do nothing.] Maybe I'll just lay down here. [Grunts and struggles to get to the floor] Lay down –uh [falls to the ground]—and rot like the rest of you. [Excited] Yeah! [Chanting] Stay a foot! Stay a foot! Stay a foot! [singing] ♫ Is this really my life? Get up, Gork! Huh? Why? ♪ I'm not gonna let you lie here, Whoa. Okay man, just be cool. ♫ And I'm not gonna be cool! Hey, Finn. ♫ Ja-a-a-ke, stop tellin' me to enjoy, bein' a foot, and get out of that trash! ♫ Heh heh. I can't take you seriously when you're singing, man. Get up! Ahh! ♫All of you make me sick! Wait, Finn! Hey, stop it, man! [ Huh? Please, man. Wait a second. Kim, get underneath Trudy. No, man. Please. I freakin' hate Trudy. [angry] Kim, I will destroy you! Okay, Okay! [Moves to get under Trudy] Yeah, do it, Kim. Yes! Now for me [gets on the other side under Trudy] Look at us! Whoa! We're like a big, normal guy. Thank you so much We are perfect together Oh, Finn, thank you. Word! Now let's go wreck up that Magic Man! Let me get in on this. I'll form the pants. [ Food. Food for a beggar Y'all got any food? We've got a little orange juice left over from – Wait a second… That's right. It is I, the magic Man! [Reveals himself and heaves magic their way.] Zap Come on, apple grease! What are you gonna do? Ohh! We're not afraid. Are you sure about that? You're darn right we are! Give us our bodies back! Why should I? You still act like a hero only so you can get what you want. Oh. You were trying to teach us to be kind without expecting anything return. I should've given you that sugar cube without even thinking about a reward. Wrong! [Hurls magic at them again. It hits Finn in the face.] Ah, geez! [worried] Finn! [angry] You've gifted us nothing but heartache, Magic Man! What is the life lesson in that?! [laughs maniacally] Yes, my children, you are so close to the answer. Answer this! Get his eyes! Cut him in the eyes! I wish I'd never been nice to you 'cause you're just a big jerk! Oh, yes, that's it! [Slips from under Finn's foot body] You've finally learned your lesson. [Zaps them with magic that returns them back to normal] And now I'm off spread my teachings to more sissy do-gooders. [Opens a portal to escape] You're welcome! Man, I frickin' hate that guy. But at least now we can all go back to our regular lives. Well, actually, we like being like this Yeah, we're strong together Bye, Finn! Thank you! Oh, okay. Bye, guys. See you, later. [Waves back at them] Wait, so, what was the lesson we just learned? [shrugs] Maybe it was, don't give your sugar to jerks. Speaking of jerks, what the blubbins, man?! Why wouldn't you help me turn back into a boy?! Well, because I kind of always wanted [mumbles] What? [embarrassed] I said, I kind of always wanted to be a foot myself. You could be a foot right now. I saw you change into a foot twice yesterday. It's complicated, man. You'll understand when you're older. Oh, hello bird. [laughs] Uh, I'm a scarecrow, see. But, I don't really want to scare you, so let me read you a poem instead. "Like a wilted flower, frail and bald. Rattled by the freezing autumn winds". [the bird flies away] Oh, I guess I'm very good at my job. But I do wish one of them would stay to hear the whole thing. [the frog begins walking by] Hi, frog! Did you come to hear my poems? They're kinda long, so you have to walk slow. Or I could just read it fast! "Late last night through fevered dreams, I heard some faint and feeble screams. They'll only last to likely leave. Was crying out in gruesome grief". We're still on his trail, Jake. Oh, hi Finn! Did you hear the poem? Hey, Raggedy. We'd love to stay and chat, but we're kind of on a mission here. Maybe next time. No, you're right Finn. A true poet doesn't need an audience. [the screen zooms in on the field, then moves up to the sky] "I stand alone beneath the bleary sky..." Shh, wait, he's gonna do it! Jake, don't put on- Sorry, man. They love me! [the mud frogs lift him up and carry him away] Whoop, ha ha! [the frog jumps up and down angrily] Oh no, you made the frog angry. He's hopping mad. [laughs] C'mon man, give it back. [the frog starts crying] [annoyed] C'mon man, give it back. Nah, man, I like being the frog king. I'm gonna see where this leads, bro. [the frogs carry him away] [sighs, then looks toward the frog]. Hey, Jake, what do you think this river is made of? Man, I don't even want to know. Then why'd you put your face in it? 'Cause I'm the figurehead! So then LSP was all, "Get out of my kitchen, Oh! Whoops, sorry Breezy. Didn't see you there. That's ok, Jake. Your head is surprisingly soft! That's my sweet neckroll. [ So what are you doing in the river, bee? I'm panning for gold. Gold?! Gold! Are you deckin' out the hive? Don't be silly, Finn. It's for Honey Man. [Honey Man is seen with his honey sticking to the grass] Hey, would you guys like to help? Yes we would! [Finn and Man that joke was... [ [Breezy walks over to the Honey Man and puts gold in his hands.] Hang on there's more! Here you go, big guy. [ Bling! [ Woah! Wow- eewww. [they are impressed until the honey lands all over them] Yeah, this isn't even the best part! Sweet crown, man. Hmm, I could swear I've seen that crown before. [the frog walks by and picks up the crown, causing Finn and Jake, we've gotta follow that frog. [they run away] Bye, Breezy! So what do you think will happen when he puts on that crown? Maybe he'll turn into a time vortex. What do you think is gonna happen when he puts it on? I don't know but I bet it will be un-frog-gettable.[1] Maybe he'll turn into a prince. [they walk into a field] Nah, man, you gotta kiss him for that to happen. [Breezy is flying around behind them] I am NOT kissing that frog. [holding pollen] Hey guys! Breezy! Hey bee, what's up? Not much, I'm just showing the boys how to collect pollen. [talking to bees] You're doing great guys! [talking to Finn and Jake] Hey, you want to know what I'm gonna do with this later? [laughing] Yeah, we'd love to chat Breezy but see we're following this frog just now so, you know. [shows the frog walking towards a cornfield] Oh yeah, right! [walking away from Breezy] We just really want to see him put on that crown. Yeah, I hear 'ya! Have fun! [walking out of the cornfield] Where'd he go? [pointing] Probably to that sweet water lily pad castle. [shows the castle] Nice! [Walking through the water] Jake, there's little tadpoles in the water. Don't let 'em get up your pants. [approaching the castle] These shorts are tighter than tadpoles. He left the door open! [ [gasps] [shows the frog in his dressing room] There he is. [looking through the window] He's gonna put it on! [shows the frog putting on the shoes] You're cute enough now! [angrily] Put on the crown! [groans, and prepares to walk away] I can't take it anymore! No wait! He's doing it! [shows the frog picking up the crown and lifting it above his head] Come one frog! Do it! Do it! Dooo iiittt! [frog guard holding [frog guards drag him away as the frog is putting on the crown] Wait, uh, no no no no no no no, NOOOOOO! Dude, how long are we gonna follow this frog? Patience, man. Something's totally gonna happen. Ahhh, so hot! Yo, Finn and Jake! [shows the water nymphs tubing down a river to the right] If you can't take the heat, get off the kitchen! [laughs] Uh, wait. Come tube with us! [laughs]. Sorry, water nymphs, we've gotta follow that frog. I just gotta see him put on that crown. What! I thought we were following him back to his treasure hoard. I ain't in it for the money. I'm doing it for the sake of discovery... and the ladies. There's no ladies! [pointing at herself] We're ladies! [laughs] Let's just swim with the water nymphs. Gotta see it. [groans] Hey, you! Frog! Look what you're doing to the boy! [sweating] Uuuggghh [quietly] Put on the crown. [angrily] Put on that crown! Ugh, be cool Jake. [he takes off his hat, and uses it to tie his hair into a large bun] What if he puts it on and turns into, like, a beautiful wish dragon? THAT'S IT! [he stretches his arms and puts the crown on the frog's head] Ha! There, you've seen it! Now let's- eh, what? Ah, you've done it now! You know the old saying; You can lead a frog to crown, but you can't... you can't... don't look him in the mouth. You take off that crown! OHHHHH, he's about to drop a gut! [the frog crushes Finn and Jake with his gut] Dang! [in the stomach] I think it's actually cooler in here. [shivers] How long are we gonna follow this frog? I just want to see him put on that crown. Okay, but why though? Why, what? Frog with crown. Frog with no crown. What does it matter? Life is short, man. It's important to finish what you start. That's what matters. Pssshh psshh psshh psshh psshh! Do it for my peace of mind, then. My mind peace. No peace. SNOW PEACE! [the Jeez, do I sound like that? Clogs, blogs, krav maga, aaaaaaannndd... princesses. [laughs] Pretty cool, huh? [looking back at the Tree Fort, Grass Lands, and the Candy Kingdom] Okay, Jake. Let's bail. Yeah! Guys, what about the little froggy? Wha- oooh! Golly! Hurry, Lady! [Breathing hard] It's happening again. That's right, Finn. Princess! The zombie infection has spread across the kingdom once again, ...and once again, it's all my fault. [Narrating] I was testing a sample of the zombie flesh I had saved when Cinnamon Bun came into the lab. He said he was hungry. I'm hungry. Not now, Cinnamon Bun. I'm busy. [Turns her back on Cinnamon Bun to work with some chemicals] [Narrating] And that's when I made my mistake. I should have paid more attention to that poor fool. [Cinnamon Bun starts messing with the Candy Zombie flesh and eats it] The Candy Zombie flesh he ingested was highly contagious. [CB groans, falls to floor behind the counter, and begins groaning violently] Cinnamon Bun? Where did you... [Zombie Cinnamon Bun lunges from behind the counter at Sugar! I escaped, but I wasn't able to stop Cinnamon Bun from infecting the rest of the kingdom. The good news is I still have all my notes for making the antidote formula. Oh, sweet! Let's board up the windows then we can get started. Princess!! Don't worry, Finn. You have the notes to my formula. Just let Science do the work. Science... is... MAHHRRAHHH! [Turns into full zombie] Nooo!!! Get that zombie outta here! Aw, nah! I am not getting eaten by zombies tonight. [Starts to board up the windows. Zombies begin to peek through, and Princess! These notes make no sense. It's all gobbledy-gak. Alright, we'll each make our own version of the formula. One of us is bound to get it right. Hmm? Hey, Princess Bubblegum trained her rat to dance. Neat. [Laughs] Done. Done! Done! Bubblegum, I'm comin' for you!!! Mine first. Sugar! Cram! Oh, my, that's a lot of zombies down there. Let's get out of here! Stairs! [They all run upstairs to the top room of a tower] Jake, try yours and Lady's next! Move outta the way! My formula is going to cure the zombies because I made the prettiest formula. Oh. My. Glob. Look at those luscious lips. I gotta go lick up the rest of that formula! Aaaaaaah! [Runs out of the tower and outside] My formula! [Pushes her way through the zombie horde] Formula! [Begins splashing the formula on her face] Oh, my Glob. Yes, I'm gonna be hot! So freakin' hot! [Her lips begins to swell and she laughs] Yeah! LSP, look out! Huh. I know you want this body, but you can't have it! You can't have it! [They swarm her and bite her turning her into a winged zombie, she flies up and presses her faces against the tower window] LSP! Dang it, Jake. We only got one formula left. Try yours and Lady's. Right. Let's hope this works. Wh-... where now?! We can barricade ourselves in the lab! Did anyone get bit? I think we're good. That door is made out of candy steel. What's the matter? [Sees the zombie and screams] Jake! Did it get 'cha? I think I'm okay. It's just a little bite. Jake! It's all good, Sweetie. I can stretch forever. Hehehehe...[To Finn, under his breath] Hey, let's hurry up with that antidote, huh, pal? [The infection spreads ups his arm as Okay, let's see here...[Looks at Princess Bubblegum's notes] [Running] You should try one of them books. Over there by the lab rat. Ha! Yeah, okay. [Runs overs to the books and opens one] Yes! This book has a glossary of symbols. [Running] That's great, buddy. Jake, I think this little guy has serious dance fever. Don't come near me, Sweetie! [Gasps] Oh, man, I'm outta shape. I think I should just stay in here, ya know. Just in case. Ya oh. Hurry, dude! I am! Okay, Jake's probably going turn into a zombie, which is okay. I just have to figure out this formula. Jake? Jake? Jake! Hang on, Lady! I'll have the antidote soon, but whatever you do, just don't let him out. He may look like the Jake that once loved you, but he's just a zombie! 아니야. 얘는 날 사랑해. ("No. He loves me.") [Lady lets him out, he cuddles her face and bites her] Hey, Lady... [Screams] The book! [Sighs] Sorry, everybody. Sorry, LSP, PB, Jake, LR, peepee poopoo doodoo. [Sighs and looks at the lab rat] You know, it's funny; I don't even know your name. Yeah? What is it, girl? [The lab rat points at the label] "Sci... ence." Your name is "Science"? Could it be? Just let Science do the work. Science... is... MAHHRRAHHH! [MY RAT!!!!] Hmm... Here goes nothing. Finn! Jake! You did it! I huh, uh... [See the zombies around him who swarm him and turn him back into a zombie] Don't worry, Science. I've got a disgusting idea. [Pour the antidote over himself and the zombies break through the shower and begin to bite Sorry about biting you, sugar. [Hugs Jake] 난 네가 깨물어 주는 게 좋아. ("I like it when you bite me.") [Laughs nervously and blushes] Oh. And so the Royal Day of Apologizing has come to an end. [ Yes. Would you please move out of the way? Science the Rat, you have served your kingdom well. [Puts medal on Science] Citizens of Candy Kingdom, rejoice! Huzzah! Rejoice! Huzzah! Rejoice! Huzzah! Huzzah!  Huh. Is this, like, eating for you? I don't know about eating, but it feels nice. Hmm. [gets up, grabs a log, and hands it to Flame Princess] Hey! [hovering in air] You two should get a room! You and that log! Not you and Finn. 'Cause you're huggin' a log, you weirdo! [laughs] Finn. Huh? Let me. [burns log to a crisp and flies up toward Ice King as Finn gasps] [laughs, then gulps] Hey now, stay away from me! Shoo shoo! [shoots icicles from hands] Oh, so you wanna get real, do ya? Well, check this! You seeing this? [starts to form a giant snowball, but is interrupted by Flame Princess punching him in the stomach] [watching snowball fall down and crash onto trees] Whoa. [grabs Ice King's beard and starts slapping him] Why don't you get a room?! [ Ow! My hams! Beat it, you freaky old trump! [kicks Ice King into the Ice Kingdom] [gets up] Huh? What's cookin'? Smells good. [while laughing] My body is engulfed in flames! [laughs] Oh, so good! [Singing Egg Song to himself.] Jake! Jake! I had an awesome dream! Flame Princess was there; My body was on fire. I think it was inspired by Flame Princess battling Ice King yesterday! That's weird. I had a dream too. I'll tell you about it! So then paintings were found and everybody's eyes lit up. Cinnamon Bun smiled and said "I saw it from miles away"... [in his thoughts] Man, I need to have that dream again. I have to get Flame Princess to beat down Ice King again. Why'd you pick this spot? Why does anyone do anything? Hmm...why do they? [starts shaking a bag of marshmallows] Mmm? No thanks. [puts a marshmallow in his mouth] Suit yourself! [whistling while flying and holding grocery bags] [muffled] Hey, look! [swallows then repeats] Hey, look! There's that big jerk you hate so much, remember? [looks over at the two] Oh, hey, kids! Fine day for a picnic. [in mock shock] Oh, dang. Did you hear that?! I think he's, like, making fun of you. What?! Yeah, it's in the tone of his voice. [stops the Ice King in midair] What did you say to me? Uh, what? What did I say? [gasps] It is in the tone of your voice. Look, just take whatever you want. Okay? Take it all! [throws contents of bag at Flame Princess] It's all just prunes! Prunes and liver! Frozen, of course. [rising up from the ground] Ah. You might have what it takes to slap these old jowls, but do you have what it takes to face my- just a second... [zaps the ground as Snow Monsters rise from the ground] Legion of Snow Warriors?! Go, fight! Protect me! [Two warriors break apart while the other two shamble off in the distance.] Oh, boy. I don't like being made fun of, Ice King. I don't like it at all! [throws fire at Ice King] Woah! [gets up and protects self with ice shields] Oh, man. Times! I call time! [builds a barrier around him that looks like his head and starts to weep in it] It's only okay if the person making the fun is someone I'm cool with! [punches Ice King's barrier] We're totes cool! I-I'm [while punching Ice King's barrier] And they do it in a respectful and knowing way! Respect? I got all kinds of respect! Oh, yeah? Then what's with that stupid smirking face? [sees Snow Monster coming up behind Flame Princess and smirks] Smirk? I smirk when I'm nervous. Bear hug! [hugs Flame Princess] And also when I'm about to win! [laughs] Booyah! [turns around and lifts back of tunic] And I didn't even get to test out my new fire-proof grundies! Put it away, man! You didn't win nothing! [to Flame Princess] Are you okay? You feel... lukewarm. I-I just need to burn a couple of forests or something. And get a good night's sleep. Yeah. Sleep. [picks up a glass of milk] Milk. [drinks the entire glass and picks up another glass of milk] Milk. [drinks the entire glass quickly] Play the sleep jam, BMO. [nods and plays white noise] Mmm. What's cookin'? Smells good. Wha?! [turns to see Ice King shooting ice at his groin] What?! Oh, no! [runs to Jake downstairs, who is drinking some tea] Jake! I had another dream. My body was being blasted. But this time, Ice King was blasting me with ice cubes! Aww. It was awful! And someone else was there. He was just laughing and laughing. He was in the first dream too, but he was whispering. I couldn't make out what he was saying. Oh, yeah! [snaps fingers] It was the Cosmic Owl! [spits out tea] What?! You didn't tell me the Cosmic Owl was there! I couldn't see him last time! Dude, that means it was a prophetic dream! You have to finish the original dream! Cosmic Owl could be whispering something wildly significant! You have to get Flame Princess and Ice King to fight again so you can see the end of the dream! Make 'em fight! [runs over to a wooden desk and starts writing a letter] Dear Ice King, you smell like stink, you're unpleasant, you're not funny, you're old, blah blah blah, sincerely, the Flame Princess. P.S., let us fight. [yells and grabs another piece of paper and writes another letter] Dear Flame Princess, you're just the worst, your hair is bad, your feet smell like face cheeks, blah blah blah, let's meet up and fight, dummy, sincerely, Ice King. [looks at two letters and grunts in approval] Flame Princess fight Ice King. Ice King! What? Ooh, beard mail! [reading off letter] Dear Flame Princess! [drops letter on ground] Huh? [reading off letter] Dear Not my beard! [Flame Princess punches What is all that noise? [looks at the fight] Ach, mein Glöb! Inferno...shot! [ Ice...the King! [ Stop that! [laughing] How's about some of this? [gets Flame Princess into a headlock and starts rubbing her hair] [falling over] Oh beans, oh beans, oh beans! I maybe went too far with this jazz. [looks down and sees he is stepping in a pile of water and hears Flame Princess growling] Flame Princess! Oh, too hot. [falls over and is knocked unconscious] Oh! [chuckles and then starts to steam through his clothes] Huh? [looks over at Flame Princess who is staring at him] Uh... You blew it. [wakes up] Huh? [gets up and sees the destruction he's caused] Okay, I can fix this. I can make it right. Ice King! [under a sheet of ice] Finn! I'm so sorry, man. [weakly] Help Gunter. Please! [Finn walks over to Gunter.] I meant after you saved me. Oh. [Gunter quacks again. Oh! That's right, carry me like a princess. Ice King! You can't escape me! [shoots a fire ball at Ice King] [turns around] Huh? [gasps] Finn! [shoots fire ball with ice] Ice. [fire ball falls into the water, frozen] Whatever. [at normal size again] I'm so, so sorry, Finn! Are you alright? No, princess. I'm the one who's sorry. [drops Ice King] Ice King hasn't been picking fights with you, it's...it's been me all along. [annoyed] What? So, you wrote that letter? Yes, but look, it's just like, I had this dream and it was because of that fight you had. It was weird, but I also liked it. But it was important because the Cosmic Owl was [Flame Princess decides Shh. I should have known. That letter said things in it that only you would know. Personal things, Finn. And you used them against me. I thought you were the one person I could- I need some time alone. Princess! But, I said I was sorry. You blew it, man. [snoring] Ah. [smacks lips] Stand and deliver, boy, because I'm Robbing Hood. Give me all your funny money, Sheriff of Naughty-hams. But BMO, I don't want to be the bad guy. I want to be Robbing Hood's pal, Friar Tux. No, Neptr. [uncaps marker and draws a mustache on Neptr's face] Ha ha! Friar Tux would never have a mustache like that. [laughs] No fair. En guard! On Blitzen! You're terrible! Whoa! Eeeee! Aaaaa! [wakes up] What? Hey! What are you kids doing breaking the treehouse? Uh... Yo, BMO, what happened? You got too much money, honey. All of this dosh is threatening the structural integrity of the treehouse. Who would have thought we could have too much treasure? I'm sorry, master. Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant! You told me to stay inside the money room, but now I am outside. What is your punishment, master? No punishment, dude. Just chill where you are. All right. I will chill where I am until you command me. So what should we do with all this swash? You should give it to Robbing Hood. No way, BMO. This is our treasure. Aw. Hey, maybe we could, like, spend it? Really? How much of it? Dude, like all of it. Then we can find completely new treasure.  Whoa! We get mail? Check it out, Jake. Dang! Wildberry Kingdom got all fancy. I continue to chill. [following Finn and Jake] Come on, Naughty-Hams. Thank you. Nice place. So how are we gonna spend all this gish? I don't know. I've never really spent money before. I've only stolen it or hoarded it. Ha! [laughs] [sighs] So... here we are in the middle of town. Let's parse out some dough to spend. Hey! What are you doing? No people or money allowed in the fountain, ya dums! Where's your sense at?! Sorry, man. We were just looking to spend some cash in town. [offers three coins] Want some? Fellas, goofing in a public fountain is punishable by a lashing, and you're trying to bribe me. Ooh! Now that's what I'm talking about, fellas. [takes crown and coins and starts to leave] [laughs] Have a good time in the fountain. [laugh] Whoa. Spending money is kind of fun. Yeah, this'll be easy. [stands up] Ho, ho, young berry lads! Yeah? Go buy the most expensive meats and furniture to adorn our new fountain home. Keep the change for your families in need. Hyup! [throws a bag of money to them] Thanks, but we're, uh, middle-class. Really? Uh, yeah, upper middle. Just get the darn furniture. Hey, no furniture or meat in the fountain! You'll wreck up the water! You can't buy me off twice, fellas. [laughs] Ah, maybe you can, fellas, maybe you can. [runs off] [laughs maniacally] Dude, we bought all this furniture and meat, and we still have a ton of gamboni left. Hmm. [gasps] Look at those gams! Hey, yo, Legs! Legs! You want a bag of money? Sure! Well, what are you gonna do for it? Well, um, I'm a dancer by trade. Show me. [tosses him a moneybag] Hup! [laughs] Finn, look. I made this guy dance. Yeah, man. Whoo! Hold it! No dancing in the streets without a permit! Go away, dude. Hey, you can't talk to me like that. All right, I'm going! [laughs raucously] This is crazy. People do anything for money. And I've got a ton of money. Dance harder, Legs! Harder! [laughs] [sighs] This bores me. You're boring! It's time to push this thing further. Middle-class berries, watch after this treasure while I'm gone. [throws them coins] Okay. Ahem. Mabel, do you hear something? Good evening. Oh no! We're being robbed! Oh, no, we're not robbers. We're actually here to give you money. What? Listen. I want to see you two do things [places a bag on the bed] for this bag of money. Okay, man. [laughs] Yeah, nice. Goji Berry Man, you sleep on the left side of the bed normally. Now you sleep on the right! Okay. I don't like sleeping on your side. It's too close to the wall! Mr. Goji Berry, you sleep on your back now—and on top of the covers. I can't sleep on my back, man. I got sleep apnea. I won't get any sleep. My wife won't get any sleep. My dance instructing will suffer. Turning down all this smoosh, huh? Dance instruction pays more than I thought. [starts walking off] Wait, man! There's got to be something else we can do to get those gold coins. Well, sure, man. As a matter of fact, you can have all the gold coins... all the gold coins you can eat! [gasp] Dinner is served! [dumps a moneybag on each of their plates] Yummy, yummy, yummy. Hey, you kids need some desert? I'll just see what I can rustle up—in the toolshed! [laughs loudly] [walks off] Guys, I'm super sorry about my friend. Here. [gives them two moneybags] Don't eat it, ya dums! How much do you think I'd have to pay them to lick the dust off all this dusty stuff? Dude, I do not approve of the way you're spending money right now. Dude, they're not doing anything they don't want to. They want my sweet cheddar, and I want to see some stuff in exchange. It's mutual—free market. What? Free market! [wheels the barrow to the house] [to himself] Don't worry, brother. I'll help you see the error of your ways. Berry lads! Berry lads! I need to spend all this blingo fast. Okay. Take me to the seediest alley in the kingdom. That's Crudberry Back Alley... in Crud Town. Friendly Crudberries, I have money for you! Come get it! Money? Money! Easy, fellas! Let's pass these out one at a time. Hey, take it easy, breh. Give us that money! [punches Finn] I-I-I don't want any trouble. [punches a hobo] I'm trying to help you. [sits] Whew! [pants] How much coin would it take for you to be my berry foot warmer? Dude! Oh, hey, man. Jake, this money is bad. We got to get rid of all of it right now. Okay, I got a plan. And this time, it's gonna involve all the money. [yawns] Finn and Jake? Princess, are you ready to earn all this cay-ash? What...? All of this sweet, sweet crunkle is yours if you let me... [holds up a tiny stool] sit on your head. [yelling] Get out of here! [scoffs] No one can say no to this much dinero. ♪M-m-money♪ Jake, I am warning you. ♪M-m-money♪ [growls] ♪M-m-money♪ Aah! Guards! Guards! Seize Finn and Jake and prepare them for execution! Or don't do that and get paid mad bucks. And take all their money! Take all my money?! Well, we were trying to get rid of all that skrilla anyway, right? Finn and Jake, yes, you have insulted me, but worse than that, you have abused the power of money! [gasps] We will deal with you swiftly and ironically by encasing you in your own molten gold! Release the golden flood! [gasps] Oh, no! Aah! Who dares? Ho, ho, ho! Robbing Hood is the defender of the poor! Me too! Good shot, BMO! I was aiming for the rope. [shoots an arrow] Yeah! Let's bounce, po' boy. Finn and Jake, if you ever return to Wildberry Kingdom again, I'll have you double-dipped in gold! Unless I get a written apology. Huh? Gold piece. You want to flip to see who writes that apology letter? How about you write it, I sign it. [laughs] No way, man. Kya! Kya! [reading karate magazine] Hmm. Ohhh, that's pretty good. Kya! [punches a hole in the punchbag pillow] [covers ears] BMO... keep it down! But you said 800 to 1000 is my time to do karate. It's my karate time! I know, but I got a headache, and I'm in a funky mood. What's wrong, dude? I don't know. I think I got restless leg syndrome. Is that from getting chubby? What? No, man, it's just restless leg. Oop! My bad. What are you reading? This old copy of Adventure Boy magazine—the only magazine for boy adventurers. This kid Rusty is getting chased down the river by three grown otters. This magazine rules! But I'm saving the end for tomorrow. [closes magazine] Cool. Well, I hope your leg feels better. I'm turning in. I'll see you up there. [blows raspberry] [sing-song] Jake... No, BMO. KYA! [punches pillow] [screams] No, BMO! No more! [walking into kitchen] Maybe some soup will take the edge off. Ew! Gross! Nasty! [smacks it with a flyswatter] Hyah! I'm sorry you were born a fly and I had to kill you, you disgusting, disgusting creature. Kya! Kya! Kya! BMO, PLEASE! [yawns, smacks lips] [sits up] Finn, was that you? [snores] [lies back down] Probably just BMO or something. That's weird. BMO doesn't like 30's jazz. [climbs downstairs] Yeesh. Creepy. [takes the needle off the record] [gasps] [fearfully] I didn't know we had one of those. [spookily] Oooooo... [panting] Hey, hey. Hey, who? Aah! Ooooooo... Hey! I killed you! Aah! [tries waving it away, then runs] Aah! Ghost fly touching me! [climbs upstairs] Finn! Finn! [jerks awake] Aah! Ghost fly, man! Aah! Aah! Okay. Come on, man. Let's get out of the house. It's a ghost fly! So what? No, man, ghost flies are filthy! They carry diseases, such as tuberculosis, polio, dysentery. They leave those little fly doodies on your soul. Aah! Finn, Jake! What's wrong?! Ghost fly! [screams] [sighs] Thank goodness we lost him. He's gone. Whoo. [swishes scythe] [screams] Run! Just run! Ay-ay-ay-ay! Hmm. [punching] Kya! Kya! We should ask what its unfinished business is. Ghosts always have unfinished business. Ghost fly, what's your problem?! Come on, dude. Tell us your unfinished business! Aah! It's no good. He's a tortured little spirit. We need help to communicate with this ghost fly. Nah, man, let's just get someone to banish it—someone with serious paranormal juice. [dials phone] Is he coming soon? I think so. His ways are kind of mysterious. That's cool. [scream] Woo? Let's get this ritual rolling. I got stuff to do. Woo! [swipes at Peppermint Butler] Hey! No! Unclean demon, feel the sting of holy water! [throws water at the ghost fly] [quietly] Thank you. [drawing chalk circles around Finn, Jake, and BMO] These circles will protect you from the ghost's attacks while I prepare the banishing ritual. Worry not, fellow believers, for in this bag, I possess all the darkest and most powerful tools of magic ever to be assembled in one place. We're perfectly safe—as long as... [the ghost fly picks up the bag] we... have... Well, huh. How about that? No biggie. We'll just hang out inside these magic circles until morning. That's when ghosts go to sleep. Yep. Just got to make it... till morning. Woo! [flies offscreen] Hmm? [gasps] The end of my story. And it's so close. Don't do it, bro. It's a trap. I know. It's an obvi trap. But wait. What if... watch this. Ha! [grabs chalk and draws a bigger circle] Mm? Dude, what are you—? If I extend the circle... [erases old circle] farther... I can get closer to the magazine. Theoretically, that is possible. Yeah, but I'm still getting a "woo-jah" feeling. This seems like a bad idea. Just have to stay inside this circle. Ha ha! How'd you do it, Rusty? How'd you shake them otters? [picks up magazine] [laughs] Man, what a great ending! [laughs again, but suddenly starts gagging] Finn? What's wrong, buddy? [breathing strangely] [turns around, revealing he has transformed into a fly] [scream] Oh, Finn, you're disgusting! Aw, that's it! I've had it with this ghost fly! I wish I were a ghost so I could punch him with my ghost fist! Jake, I have a radical option. I've been studying a karate move that could temporarily stop your heart long enough for you to fight the ghost on his own plane of existence. What? It's okay! I learned it out of a magazine. [looks at Finn crawling on the ceiling] Finn... [to BMO] All right. But first you got to give me some unfinished business so I can come back as a ghost. Tell me a joke. Okay. What do you call a bear that only attacks guys named Paul? Kya! [punches Jake] [choking] [becomes pale and falls backwards] I killed Jake! Yay, Whoa! BMO, you killed me. Whoa. Wow. Wow! [disappears] Jake! I can't hear you! I will start your heart up in five minutes, okay? [holds up fingers] This many! Okay. Five minutes. Whoa. Is this some kind of low-level dead world? That's a bummer. Aah! Aah! Oh, stuff! Aah! Ohh! Ohh! Get away! [throws a ghost cat at the ghost fly] Aah! You killed it! Aah! Aah! Aah! Get away! [screams] [screams] Oooooo... [stops] Hmm? Hoooooo! That's right. You never finished the soup. That's your unfinished business! [nodding] Woo-woo. And now that you've finished it, you get to ascend to a glorious, new peaceful realm. [in awe] Ahhh. Bam! [slaps the fly to the floor, making it disappear in a cloud of smoke] Shouldn't have tried to kill me, son! [blows at smoke] Yes! [starts ascending and glowing] What's happening? Oh, BMO must be bringing me back! Yes! Yeah, BMO! Mm. BMO? Jake, I missed you, bro! Jake! Don't ever leave me again! Good job, BMO! You brought me back. [weakly] Yes. Yay, Whew! Just about done. Mm, oh boy. How much Softy Cheesy for ya deezy? A little? A lot? Blech! None! But you used to love Softy Cheese! I don't wanna talk about it. What was that? Probably an owl. [Takes a bite of his hot dog] Mm... Mm, mm... [Spits out his food] A ghost!! Dude. It's just Ghost Princess. Hey, GP. [She howls.] [Whispering to Jake] She's weird, huh? [Ghost Princess gets closer to Are you haunting us? Yeeeeessss... Oh, okay. [Tactfully] Well, could ya knock it off?? Sorry... It's just... I'm doomed to haunt this mortal plane... Oh. Well, let's hear more about that, honey. Until I discover the cause of my death, my soul can't ascend to the 50th Dead World. But as a ghost, I have no memory of my mortal life... and no idea how I died... [Gasps] It's a crime case! Whoa, step back, nephew. We don't know she was moidered! That's right. We don't even know how she was moida'd, but I'm the hard-boiled sleuth who's gonna crack your case wiiiide open! OH! That sounds wonderful! This way, gentlemen! Whoa. Your neighborhood is... uh... very peaceful. It's the cradle of my despair... [Awkwardly] Right, right. Well... here's me. Our first clue! [Reading grave] "Female." It's a good start, but we need more. Jake, it's time to interrogate the neighbors. We'll do it good cop bad cop style. I CALL BAD COP! Awww... Yo, ghost! Yo, yo! Yo, wake up, fool! Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. What?!?! Yo, ghost, whaddaya know about the lady buried next to you? What, you mean her? [Pointing at Ghost Princess] She's been here longer than almost anybody! He's right...! [Starts crying] And don't think I don't see what you do, Ghost Princess. What...? Sneakin' off at night, scarin' peeps, hauntin' at all hours... 'cause you can't deal with your issues! Leave her be, Boilbee. Whaaat? A princess deserves empathy, not your sass. [Throws another cheese puff at him] Nyeee... nyeee... Butt out, Clarence! Some of us still want to feel, you know? The vital... [Eats another cheese puff] ...magnetism of life. [Ghost Princess stares in amazement.] The vibrating energies that connect all living and... nonliving beings. Nyaaargh! I don't like your words! Arrrgh... [Sinks back in the ground] [To Clarence] I'm I don't think so, m'lady, but I am honorèd. Whadda you know about Ghosty-pees gettin' murdle-lurdled? Sorry, I don't know anything. I can't imagine anyone who would harm someone as beautiful as this. [Kisses her hand] Whoa. Smooth. Did you try looking yonder? [Points away] That's where the ne'er-do-well ghosts hang out. Right... Ne'er-do-wellers. Let's do this, Jake. [To Ghost Princess and Clarence, running off with Finn] You stay, and eat cheese puffs! Geez. Look at this place. It's all bunked up. Yeah, no wonder this is where the ne'er-do-wells go when they deezy. I got a feelin' these ghosts are gonna be harder to shake than Boilbee. Yeah, well get ready, 'cause this biz is gonna get ridonk. Cool, man. Hey, can I be bad cop now? No. Okay, let's check this guy out. What's it say? [Reading grave] "Some donkus." WAKE UP, DONKUS! WE GOT QUESTIONS! DINGUS! TIME TO SING, YA CANARY! [Digs into the grave while grunting; opens coffin] BAM!! YAH! [Grabs body] What'chu know about Ghost Princess, huh?! Give it up, Dungus! Hey, man, take it easy. [Slaps Jake's hand off] You do your job, I do mine! [To body, in a low growling voice] TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW, PUNK!! Uh-oh. [Picks up broken dagger] What's this? A busted knife. Is this your knife, bro? TELL ME!!! [To Jake, whispering] Jake, good cop... Alright. Cool off, bad cop! [Pulls Finn back] This ghost ain't home, man! [Pants heavily] Well, you're lucky my partner's here... pal. He's not worth it, man. [Grunts] These ghosts think I'm playin'. They think it's all a big game. But you know what? You know what I'm gonna do? What? I'm gonna turn this game... UP-SIDE-DOWN!!! [His voice echoes.] So, you really don't know how you died either? Of course not. [To ticket vendor] Two, please. [To Ghost Princess] And we might never find out, but that's okay because right now, in this moment, I'm feeling pretty sweetles, you know? I feel... sweetles also in this moment also. That's great, Ghost Princess. I'm glad we can feel this way together, in the face of uncertainty. Llllladies and gents! The center for Ghost Community Outreach and ghostdates.com present... SPIRIT WAVES! More beautiful than I could imagine. Are you talking about Spirit Waves...? I'm talking... about you, Princess. YYYYAAAAAH!! [Rapidly batters a fryer basket with a stick then breaks a pole by kicking it] GHOSTS! YOU GHOSTS! COME OUT! [Throws the stick at what looks like a tree then starts running around panting] I think this place is abandoned, man. They're just hidin' 'cause they know they're guilty! Yo! Yo! That's my grave! Why're you fops trashin' our spot?! [Nervously] We thought you were... hiding. Dude. We were at the Spirit Waves show. Kill these fools! BRING IT ON, YOU MAMAS! Hold up! These guys are with me. ...A'ight, Clarence, but only because of that one time when I did that thing by accident and you were cool about it. It's your lucky day, punks. Phew! Thanks, Clarence! Yo, I'm sorry we haven't solved the case yet. It's alright, Finn... I'm calling off the investigation. What? Why? I don't feel tormented anymore now that I'm with Clarence. Oh. That's... that's cool. It's hard to explain, but it's like we already know each other. I feel it, too. Our spirits must be intwined in the cosmic wheel of time. Nice! Let's go to my private mausoleum where we can be... private. [Exits with Ghost Princess] Yugh! [To Finn, exiting] Thanks for your help...! A'ight. [Sighs] [Scene cut; Look on the bright side, guy! We looted all this sweet grave booty! Ka-ching! [Drops a variety of treasures] Jake! You looted?! That's bad, man! You're supposed to be good cop. Oops... I didn't know it was wrong. Come on, let's put all this stuff back. What?! All of it?! Yes, Jake. [Wipes dust off broken dagger] Huh. This dagger says, "Rence." What's that? I guess some donkus's real name was... [In realization] ReeeeEEEENCE?!! Have we met before? It's hard to explain, but it's like we already know each other. Is this your knife, bro? This ghost ain't home, man. What is it, dude?? [Low, growling voice] ...We gotta dig up the princess. Look! [Pointing at a piece of a blade stuck in Ghost Princess's physical body; he pulls it out] Sorry. [To Jake] Lookit! [Puts dagger pieces together; the name "CLARENCE" is formed] "Cla-rence." Clarence was some donkus! Some donkus skee-bopped Ghost Princess!! Clarence is your murdler! Warrior Princess! Give up your kingdom! I... did it? I forgive you, Clarence! Take my hands! Ascend with me to the 50th Dead Wooorld...! I can't! My soul is stuck! I have to know how I died! Oh, Glob... My life is like a fart. Whoa, wait a minute. Say that again! MY LIFE IS LIKE A FART!!! I know you, man! From the Squeez-E-Mart! Huh? Uh... Squeez-E-Mart? I'm starting to remember! [Eyes light up and flashback begins at the Squeez-E-Mart.] [Voice over] I was a broken man. More. Think you've had enough, man. I don't care. My life is like a fart. Huh? [Walks over to the Softy Cheese dispenser] My life is like a fart! [Drinks Softy Cheese from the dispenser] HEY! HEY, STOP THAT! CITIZEN'S ARREST! [Clarence ignores him and bloats up.] Hey, be careful, man!! So that's why you don't like Softy Cheese! Claaareeence!!! Ghost Princess!!! Congratulations, you kids! Haha, yeah! [To Finn and Jake] Goodbyyye...! Thanks for everything! [To Finn and Jake] Thanks for everything! Goodbye! You sure you're ready for this, man? Yeah. Gimme one a' them cheesy dogs, man. All gone? [Jake nods.] Lemme see. Move your tongue left... [Moving his tongue left] Wah-vah. ...And right. [Moving his tongue right] Vah. I'm proud of you, pal. Real proud. Hey, man, it's Couples Only Movie Night tonight. Who are you bringin'? I don't know. Who are you bringin'? I'm bringing my girlfriend, dude. Oh. I'll take this duck! It's couples night! You gotta bring someone you can smooch. Man, I don't want to be smooched! Don't have to smooch. You just have to bring someone you can smooch. It's, like, the rules. Lame. [Attempts to kiss duck, but it flies away.] Ah! Well, I'll take this blanket! [Kisses blanket.] Put the blanket down. [Pats the ground beside him.] Have a seat. I want to explain some "things" to you about couples. You all square? Yeah, yeah. Who you gonna call? I'm going to call a girl I don't have to kiss. [Calls Princess Bubblegum.] [Whistling as she answers the phone.] Hello? Hi Princess! Would you go to Couples Movie Night with me? Sounds romantic, Finn. No! I was just wondering if you wanted to go with me. [Begins to blush.] No, sorry, Finn. I'm busy practicing for the Whistling Choir Death Match Championship. But— Auf Wiedersehen! ("Goodbye") She doesn't want to go! Yes she does! We just need to help her realize that she wants to go to the movies with you. [Takes out cell phone.] I'm calling Marceline. What? [Begins to call Marceline.] Look, man, I've been learning a lot about vampires lately. I realized my fear was based on ignorance! Speak. Hey, hey, Marceline. Got a favor to ask, Babe. We've gotta make Princess Bubblegum jealous, so she'll go to the movies with Finn. [Marceline sneaks out from a pile of dirty clothes behind Hehe. Are you gonna help us? Yeah, I'll help. It'll be funny. Okay, so here's the plan. [Points at Finn] You start saying things and [Points at Marceline] you start laughing waaay loud. And then Bubblegum... [Camera pans up to Princess Bubblegum through the window above them.] will get jealous of you [Points at Marceline]. Which will awaken her Finn love! You start us off. Um... hmm funny... funny... giddy up? Hehe. Um... diggy diggy? Diggy diggy! [Claps hands.] Diggy diggy! Greetings, Finn. [Unamused tone.] Hey, Marceline... [Waves, amused tone] Hello, Bonnibel. [Still umamused] Yeah, yeah. So, what's so funny, Finn? I, um... uh... it's... something. Well, then, keep it down out there! I'm trying to whistle practice! [Walks away, whistling.] That was great! Now, we begin Phase 2! It's so powerful! Wait here! Hehehe... [Stretches away.] Hey, look, Finn, I know Jake's your friend and all, but... if you really want Bubblegum to go to the movies with you, you've gotta like, stop taking advice from your dog and take some advice from a real girl! But Jake said Phase 2 is powerful! [Blows raspberry.] How is Jake going to know what girls want more than a real girl? Yeah... Okay great. So what we need now is something... fun! Girls love fun more than anything. Fun, fun, fun! If you can show Princess Bubblegum you're fun, she'll deffs wanna go to the movies with you. Haha, you said fun so much, it sounds all weird now. Fun. F— So... what do you like to do for fun, Finn? Oh, Oh! I like to wrestle! And fight! [Makes fighting sounds & positions.] But girls don't like that. No, no, that's perfect! All you need to do is get in there and wrestle Princess Bubblegum to show her how fun you are. [Floats away.] Ffffffuuunnn. Ffffuuunn. [Begins to walk after Marceline but is stopped by Jake.] Whoa, where you going, man? Check it out! What is that stuff? It's a lute-suit! Girls love it! Trust me. Finn! What the plum are you wearing? You look horrible! It's a lute-suit! And Finn looks adorable in it! Well, it's going to ruin the plan. What she talking about, Finn? Well... I was going to give Marceline's plan a try, too. Her idea?! What's wrong with my idea? [Marceline flicks her tongue at [Whistles.] Oh, hey, Finn! Did'ya ever find some—Whoa! What are you wearing? Oh... this is my... Lute... suit. Oh. [Singing and playing the lute.] This is my lute-suit! [Starts to laugh.] Finn, that is hilarious! [Starts to laugh again.] Oh, you are killing me! [Giggles.] Psst! [Still a bat and flying near the ceiling, makes wresting motions and noises.] Oh, yeah! [Puts lute on chair-Jake.] So... Headlock! [Puts Princess Bubblegum in a headlock and she falls to the ground screaming.] Guards! That suit was ridiculous. Ridi—Ridiculous? What? Can you believe this girl, Finn? Huh? Can ya? Uh... I guess the suit did feel... a little silly. Well, fine! You can just give it back then! I'm sorry! Good luck getting to that movie without my help! Ruff. [Stretches away.] Gee, he seems pretty ticked. Naw, he just needs some spaghetti. Oh, okay. Well taste this, then. I've gotta a new plan. Really? The only thing women like more than fun is excitement! She needs to feel her blood pump, man! She needs to... be chased by wolves! Like metaphorically? Come on, I'll teach ya how to show a girl a good time. Wraps Finn's arms around her.] Hold tight. You ready? Uhh... [Holds tighter.] Mhmm. Shhh! She's probably asleep! This was a really good idea. [Turns into a bat.] Now don't blow it this time! Haha, okay. Oh, Finn, thank goodness you're here! There's wolves in my room! Yeah, I know! I put them there! Pretty exciting, right? Heh heh. [Sadly] I'm sorry to do this, Finn. But until you stop acting like a psycho, you're forbidden from entering the Candy Kingdom. Farewell. [Walks back into the castle, a pretzel gate sliding closed behind her. A duck quacks, and poos on him.] I don't understand, Marceline. I tried everything. I guess she just doesn't like me. [Marceline puts a finger to his lips.] Shhh. Come on, Finn, a brainlord like Bonnie? You'll be bored with her in a week! And anyway I, for one, think you're pretty great. [Kisses Finn on the cheek.] Sorry it didn't work out the way you wanted. See you later, I guess! [Flies away.] Marceline! Of course! It's been Marceline all along! Hey, man, I've been looking for you. Sorry for acting like a dweeb before. Want some leftover spaghetti? Ah, no, thanks, man. But I really need your help! 'Bout time! Uh-oh. [Makes guitar noises.] Marceline! Will you go to the movies with me?! We need to talk... [Singing] Good evening my dear, your escort is here! Finn, you do NOT want to go down that road with me. With you, I would walk down any road, m'lady. Especially, if it leads to the movies. Oh, yeah? No one would want to go to the movies with... [Turns into a giant tenctacle monster] this! [Laughs evilly and picks up Finn.] What do you think of me now? How do you like your popcorn? Uuugh! [Turns back to normal.] You're starting to annoy me! Well then let's do something fun, like go to the movies! Get off me! [Throws Finn onto her couch and floats down beside him while Jake is hiding behind the couch] Finn, I like you, but I— Headlock! [Puts Marceline in headlock.] No! [Pushes Finn off] Listen to me. I'm not going to go to the movies with you! I just don't like you... that way. I'm sorry Finn, I just... I don't wanna date you. Date me? Man, I just wanna go to the movies. But everybody hates me. Wait, you don't want me to be your girlfriend? Huh? No! Movies! If you weren't looking for a girlfriend then why were you romancing it up all day? 'Cause Jake said Couples Night had weird kissing requirements and romance initiation rituals and whatever else. I didn't really say all that. [Mumbles something and hides behind couch.] Of course I'll go with you, Finn! You will? Yeah, as friends. Of course as friends! But no tongue. Yea—Wha? [Both laughing excitedly] Oh, man! I can't believe I'm finally going to see this movie! Oh, mon cher. I guess zese is goodbye. No, not goodbye. Let's say Farewell! Couples Night sucks! Marceline, would you do me the honor, of getting the plop out of here? There's nothing I'd like more. [Pushes Finn off the truck they are sitting on and flies up.] Nothing can ever tear us apart. [screams and wakes up in his bed, clutching his blanket. From outside the door he can hear Tree Trunks' reassuring tone.] Hold on, Sweet Pig Trunks. We're coming. [She and Mr. Pig enter Sweet P's room through a small door flap.] [Holding out his large hands, his parents stand on them and he lifts them to his cheeks and weeps.] There, there, Sweet P, it was just a dream. [She says as she rubs his shoulders] [She wipes away his tears with her trunk and he calms down.] Just a dream. [Smiles] That's my brave little boy. Now you better get dressed; today's your first day of school! [Gasps] Now eat up. [She cranks the table upward so he can eat his food.] Yum! That's fuel you're gonna need later to soak up allll the education! [Mouth full of food] Yesh, dahd! [Slurps up the rest of his eggs] [Holding a lunchbox] Okay, there's your lunch and an apple for the teacher. [ Golly, it's awful nice of y'all to take Sweet P to school on his first day. [Hiding behind a Banana Guard] Our pleas', T.T.! Yeah, first day of school can be real tough. We wouldn't want Sweet P freaking out or awakening any latent evil spirits within himself! [Cautious laughter] Well, we're gonna miss you, son. [He and Tree Trunks hug Sweet P's leg tightly.] [to Finn] You think he's still secretly evil, that he's still all "Lich-y" in there? Mm, not sure. I don't know, Finn, he just seems so... sweet! [Sweet P hugs his parents back.] [Unconvinced] Mm. [Waving] Bye! Bye! [Passionately kiss] [to Finn] So far so good. [They both gasp as they see a squirrel whose head is stuck in a glass jar.] Fat squirrel in trub! Gah! [Sees Sweet P running towards the squirrel] Oh, no! [Jake pulls him back.] Wait, Finn. Let's just see how this plays out. [Reaches the struggling squirrel and turns the jar over. The squirrel's head slides out, and it lets out a sigh of relief. Daww! Hmm... Alright, welp, see you later, Sweet P! [Waves] Bye. [Waves] Bye, Teddy-Man. [Waves] [He taps his fingers together for a bit. When a voice behind him shouts, he turns to see three other kids.] Hey, Baby-Man! Did your grandma knit your clothes? Yeah, and she's my mom! [All the kids laugh at this, and Why are you laughing, Baby-Man? You're not even a real kid! Huh?! You're nothing but a big, weird baby-man! [The kids laugh snarkily, which brings Sweet P to tears.] [The teacher rings the bell, and all the kids, except Sweet P, run inside.] Baby-Man! [Sniffles and sits down hugging his knees. There are two adults that witness the scene, and they watch him.] Let's see what we got here. Hello there. Intimidated by those bullies, eh? Uh, yeah. What's your name, kid?  I'm the one true No? Yes, sir, all kinds! Such as... dancing. You could blow off this podunk school and get a proper dance education! Then you can come back and really show those mean kids and make your parents proud! Hey, King of Ooo! Yes, Toronto? You are a certified dance instructor, right? Show the kid the dance you do. Nooo, that dance is too tough for an amateur! Aw, come on. You gotta show the kid. It's awesome! Yeah, I know it's awesome, but I really don't think the kid is ready. Ready? I don't think he's tough enough to be ready. I'm tough enough to be ready! See?! The kid is tough... and ready! [Takes the apple out of his backpack and hands it to the King of Ooo] Please?! [He jumps up and down excitedly.] Aah, I do see it! [Gushes] Eee! You've got a good eye, and you're a good dog! [Hands the apple to Toronto, who holds it. Turning back to Sweet P, he lifts up his shirt to expose his belly.] Watch this, kid. [He gives a shake that sends his belly swinging back and forth.] Ahh! [ Well, we got us a prodigy here. You're ready for advanced classes. [The two lead Sweet P away from school and into town.] Hey, you mugs, wanna see some world-class dancing? Just turn around! Ah, leave me alone! Leave me alone, too. I'm turning around! [Turns to see Sweet P shaking his belly. He snorts and laughs, causing his fellows to turn around, walk back, and laugh as well. They laugh so heartily that their golden teeth pop out of their gums and onto the sidewalk.] Teeth! [Scoops them up] [Pickpockets the laughing people's money] Ha, ya did great! You should come back tomorrow, kid, for more dancin' lessons! Have a gold star! [Hands Sweet P a large metal gold star] Show that to your parents, kid. They'll love it! But... don't tell 'em where you got it, or you'll ruin the surprise. Just think how proud they'll be at your big, uhh, end-of-the-year recital! You understand? Of course Sweet P understands; he's a good boy! A good boy! [Smiles giddily] So, how was school? Yes, how'd ya do? [Sweet P shows them the gold star.] A gold star?! I'm gonna put this where we can see it every day. [Taking the star, he goes and sticks it on the refrigerator.] Thumbs up! Thumbs up! Come on, thumbs up! [With encouragement, Sweet P gives a thumbs up.] Thumbs up! [Giggles] Thumbs up! Thumbs up! Well, this is our place. We'd invite you in, but the place is a mess. He's right; we're filthy. Listen, we all need a break. Go on home, kid, and we'll see you tomorrow! Mm! Sweet P, uh, we're going on a date. You're smart and educated enough to stay at home all by yourself. The proof is on the fridge! [They leave.] Mama and Papa will be so surprised if the refrigerator is all covered with stars when they get back. One more star should do it. I need to find King of Ooo and Toronto to get me that last star. I don't know, K.O, they've gone rancid. Horse feathers! A lick of gold paint is all it needs! [Inside the shack] Just a couple more garbage stars, eh, Toronto? Mo' stars means mo' dosh! Soon we'll have enough scratch to fund my big comeback! This kid is great at helping us rob people! And best of all, he doesn't know a thing! Because if he did... We'd have to take care of him! [They both shake the stars violently.] [Outside, Sweet P is startled and steps back, snapping a twig. The two stop.] What was that?! [They go outside.] Sweet P? What did you hear? What does it matter?! None of it was good! We gotta take care of him. Aaa! [Runs away frightened] I shouldn't have said that out loud. [Runs back home] Mom, Dad! [Peeking inside his home, he sees they are not there.] Hey, kid! Toronto and I talked it over, and we decided that we're not going to [Air quotes] "Take care of you." We're going to burn down your orchard! [Ignites a torch] [Angrily] Nooo! Yup, we're gonna burn it down—unless... Unless? You leave home and your loving parents and come dance with us forever. Forever! Come on, Sweet P. The people love you! They do? Well, mostly they love to laugh at you. I mean, look at yourself. You're a— a— a big, weird baby-man! [Laughs] Baby-Man, Baby-Man [The King of Ooo joins in as they step closer to Sweet P.] [His eyes capture the torch's light, they flicker, and then the scene goes dark.] Stop. [They both gasp in surprise as the torch goes out.] I have learned much from you. Thank you, my teachers. And now for your... education. [His eyes produce a flame, and they all become surrounded by fire.] Before there was time, before there was anything, there was nothing, and before there was nothing... there were monsters. [The area changes to a pile of grotesque monsters compounded together and shrieking. The King of Ooo and Toronto are terrified.] Here's your gold star! [ Mr. King of Ooo? [He sees the two covered in soot as they rub their eyes, still in fear.] Monster! Monster! Waaaaah!! [They take off their valuables and run out of the orchard.] [Stares at his hands and squeezes them] Just a dream! Morning, son - Sweet P! [Gasps in excitement and lifts his hands to toss gold coins and jewelry onto the table] Surprise! Oh, my, my, where did you get all this bling? [Shrugs] Uhh, my teachers! Wow, how nice of those teachers! Mm-hmm! [Smiles] Hey, Baby-Man, guess who we are! [They all dance, stop, point at Sweet P and harshly laugh.] [Tears well up in his eyes, but he calms himself. The kids are confused by his reaction.] [  What'ya building? Um, it's just a little stick fort. Oh, rad! Look. It's just my size. [Role-playing] Hey, get away from my fort, you big stinky monster! I like it when you get small, Jake. Yeah, me too. Whoa, whoa! [Surprised] Whoa, Peppermint Butler! Finn, Jake, the Princess wants to see you. As princess of Candy Kingdom, I'm in charge of a lot of candy people. They rely on me. I can't imagine what might happen to them if I was gone. And after my brush with death at the hands of the Lich, [while yawning] I realized something. [Stops yawning] I'm not gonna live forever Finn. [Whispers] I would if I could. But modern science just isn't there yet. [While unlocking a door] So I engineered a replacement who can live forever. I call her... Goliad. [Finn] Wow! [Jake] Aww! She's cute. Hi, Goliad. I'm And I'm Hi, Finn. Hi, Jake. Hi, Goliad. [Quietly] Hi, Finn. What did you use to make her? Oh, um... [Starts brushing Goliads's paw with a brush.] Pretty standard candy creature soup. Some acids. Some algebra. [While picking out one of her baby teeth from the treasure chest] And I threw in one of my baby teeth so she had my DNA. Wow, DNA?! Yeah. All it takes is just one little tooth, or, [Pulls out one small strand of Finn's hair] a single hair. It's all it takes. Princess Bubblegum, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm good. Haven't slept for a solid 83 hours, but... yeah, I'm good. Aw, you should go to bed. I can't go to bed, Goliad has huge, mondo mama brains. I still need to fill them with knowledge... [Starts yawning] about how to rule a kingdom. [Stops yawning] What? Let us teach her. Uhh, okay. I guess that will be all right. [Finn] Yea! [Jake] Yeah! Teachers! [Finn] Yeah, woo-hoo! [Jake] Teach, teaching teachers. Woow, woow, woow! C'mon, Goliad. [While leaving Bubblegum inside Goliad's room] See ya later, Princess! Get some sleep! Huh? Whu...? Bye guys...[Starts sleeping] Look, Goliad. This is a preschool. I'm gonna set up some obstacles and all that for you to learn on, is that okay? [starts patting Goliad] Yeah, thanks Finn. I'm excited to learn. Okay, great. Jake, you go and get some kids from inside to help with the lesson and such. Okay. C'mon, Goliad. Yes, Jake. Uhm... Uhh... [while beating him up] Stinking, durken... Now, now, settle down. Jake, these kids seem pretty scary. Ah, nah, these kids ain't nothin'! Kids groove doozyploon! Check this out. Hey, there kids, who wants to play-- Uhh, easy now children. Easy- Get his brain! Get his brain! Get his eyes! Listen up, you kids better stop donkin' around! You're gonna mess up Goliad! [kids start running in fear and stand by one of the walls] It's my way or the highway, get it? I'm Don Juan Cherry Tempo! Now march, glib blobbit! Don't be acting all crazy. Wow, holy shmow! Oh, hey, y'all are just in time. You ready to pop this croc's back Dr. Goliad? Yeah, I think so Finn. I've learned a real lot already so far. Sooo much... from Jake. Uh, you know, Finn... maybe this isn't such a good idea, actually. Oh, no, it's cool. I got helmets for everybody. Okay, Goliad, you ready to lead? [Pulling out a stop watch] Ready! Okay, in 3, 2, 1... [ Alright, listen up! You kids better stop dunking around and get on that ramp! You're gonna mess up Stop stop! No, Goliad, no! Leading isn't about scaring people, you gotta stay calm and use your head. Use that beautiful brain, girlfriend. My brain? Are you sure? Yeah! Don't be shy. Try it on me, lead me. Okay, Finn. [An eye comes out of her head and [Starts gasping for breath and coughs.] No, Goliad, that's wrong, too. You can't just control people or whatever, it's messed up. No, Finn. This way is good. Everyone did what I wanted. Really fast, no mistakes, calm like you said. This is definitely is the way to lead. Definitely. Um, no, no. ...Wait, is that true? [Starts pondering] C'mon, Goliad. Let's go see Princess Bubblegum. Princess! Princess! Goliad's got mind control powers! She got the wrong idea about leadership! Oh, I was afraid this might happen. Where is she now? [Finn] She's chilling in the garden! [Jake] We left her outside the garden! Hello, Goliad. Hello, Princess. I hear that you learned a lot today. Yes, I led the children. But Finn said you used yelling and mind control. Yes, it was good. Goliad, [Gets a bee on her finger] let me tell you about leadership. You see this fat bee? It's gentle [Picks up a flower] and makes the flower happy, and pollinated. They both get what they need...[Bee gets some pollen from the flower] ...and that's how leaders should be. No, Princess. Bee cares not for flower. If getting pollen hurts or kills flower, bee would not care. [Kills the bee] Bee is stronger than flower.  [Gasps and starts speaking in her mind] Oh, no. She's too far gone, too corrupted. If we're not careful, she can throw an ultra-tantrum and wind the castle apart. I will have to disassemble her and try again. No, Princess. [Bubblegum gasps] [Spinning her head towards Princess Bubblegum] This is my castle now. Don't worry, Princess. We'll stop her! No, Finn. She's far too powerful. Here's the plan I'm going to build another Candy Sphinx in my lab. It's the only thing that can possibly match her. Just keep her busy 'til I return. [Starts to run towards the lab] And don't think about the plan! She can read your minds! [Thinking] Ugh, eyeball... Just tuck that eyeball back in its hole. Goliad, no! [Shouting] Jake, don't swallow! Uhh, you're in [In his mind] Don't think of the plan... Think of something else. Think of something else. Don't worry, Princess. We'll stop her! No, Finn, she's too— Anyway, like I was saying, she's far too powerful— Finn, she's far too powerful. Here's the plan. I'm a buff baby that can dance like a man. [Goliad focuses even more.] I can shake-ah my fanny, I can shake-ah my—Ahh! Here's the plan. I'm going to— Goliad! No! Wait, brother, why must we fight? Rule with me! No, brother! Don't you see? They're turning us against-- So be it. Finn, are you okay? Yeah, that dude saved me. That's Stormo, Goliad's new brother. Wha-- What are they doing now? They're about to have a psychic showdown. Wow, man, so, like... I guess they're so evenly matched that it's a stale— [Spits out Chet] It's a stale— [spits out another two candy people] They're so evenly matched that it's a stalemate! Yes. Stormo sacrificed himself to keep Goliad in check for all eternity. Well, that's pretty cool, but... I don't understand. If Goliad and Stormo are the same, how come Stormo is a good guy? Oh, that's simple I used some of your heroic DNA in Stormo's recipe and not Goliad's. Oh, whoa so, that means Stormo is like... my son? Well, yeah... in a way. Happy birthday, Stormo. Jake, if I beat you, you have to call me "sensei" for a month. Deal. Hi, guys! 'Sup, Turtle Princess? Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh! Get your hands off me, Steven!! YAH! [Throws him down] And you, too, Chad! [Flicks ant away] Heeeey, giiiirl! Heeeey, giiiirl! Brought you some little fruit pies. Awesome. [Starts eating] How ya doin' out here? Turtle Princess, the men out here will not leave me alone! Huh... it must be nice. Nah. It's horrible. They just want me for my lumps! [Vulture screeches at them.] These lumps aren't for SALE, BILLY! [Throws fruit pie at vulture making it fly away.] [To Turtle Princess] Aren't you sick of men going after your turtle lumps? Actually, I've never been able to work my T-lumps. I just know what I read in books. [Gasps] Hey! You should write a book telling me how to do it! Oh, my Glob! Turtle Princess! I've always wanted to write trashy books for ladies! [Snake hisses at her] YAH! [Hits it] BACK UP OFF ME, RICKY!! [To Turtle Princess] Yeah, everyone needs to know when I work these lumps, no man is immune to their influence! Jake's ball landed over here, BMO! [Gasps] LSP! Finn would be perfect as the test subject for your lump studies! Yay! I win! [To Jake] Bow to your sensei! Aaah... Heh heh heh heh heh heh! [To Lumpy Space Princess] You gotta go undercover and conduct your lump science on him. Prove to the world that even a white knight like Finn is no match for the power of your lumps! I'll do it! For the world! And for you, girl! Oh, girl! [Recording herself] Day one on my way to Finn and Jake's. Side-note I look fresh to death with my new dress and purse. Mm! Mm! Mm! [Takes out a fruit pie and "puts on" its custard before eating the fruit pie; knocks on Finn and Jake's front door; Jake answers.] Hello? [Seductively] Heeey, Jaaaake... Is Finn hooome...? [Wincing in disgust] Ooh! 'Sup, LSP? Oh, hey. I'm answering that ad you put out for the adventure secretary. Wha? Ugh... Hold on. I'll get it. [Starts digging through bag] Hold on. It's down in there. Okay, wait, I got it. Uh, here you go. [Reading fake ad] "WANTED—ADVENTURE SECRETARY." [Sniffs it] Smells like fruit pie. It's nice of you to wanna be our secretary... but we don't need one. [Whispering to Jake] Dude, look at 'er. [Messily slathering custard on her face] Mmm... Oh, Glob... Yeah, it's sad. Come on. We've gotta help 'er. Alright, LSP. Come inside. Awesome. [Recording herself] Totally nailed the interview. [Licks custard off face] I'm gonna need a secretary desk! [She immediately forces dishes off a table ("Rrr-AAAGH!") and puts her working equipment. Finn and Jake just look at each other.] I'm starving! What's for dinner?! Oh. Uh... [Checks fridge] We got some blueberries.  Yuck. [Recording herself] Looks like I'll have to bust out these cobras to get a better dinner. [Seductively] Hey, Finn... [Rubbing her lumps] You got anything better to eat?? [Focused on the fridge] Oh, cool. Old spaghetti. I'm gonna go heat this up. [Exits] [Recording herself] Chapter 1 "Gotcha!" [To Lumpy Space Princess] Have a good night. See ya in the mornin'. G'night, you guys! [They go upstairs.] [Recording herself] Finn is even more overpowered by my lumps than I thought. I guess at the end of the day, it's all about the lumps. [Her phone rings ( [On other end] Hey, girl. Oh, Turtle Princess! This book is coming out awesome! Oh, good, girl! I can't wait to read it! Thanks, girl. Goodnight, girl. Goodnight, girl. [Hangs up] What's that? 'Sup, LSP? What're you guys doing? We're carrying these rocks on an adventure, up to the Mystery Mountains. Oh, nuh-uh, I am not gonna carry rocks! That's okay. Jake can carry 'em. Yup. Ugh... Fine... [Picks up two rocks] You're welcome, Finn. Ugh... My arms weren't meant to carry so many rocks, you guys! C'mon, LSP. You can make it. Uuoohhh... [Drops the rocks in exhaustion; her phone rings ("Heeey, girl! Heeey, girl!") and she answers.] Turtle Princess, you can't call me! You're gonna blow my cover! Good morning, girl. Good morning, girl. Would you be mad at me if I ask out Billy, that vulture who was hitting on you? I think he's cute and I would— Hey, LSP, shake a leg. [Whisper] Can't talk right now, girl! [Hangs up] The Loch of Phantoms. Princess Bubblegum said the rocks would show us the safe path. [Starts throwing rocks into the lake] [To herself] This is way too boring for my book. [Acting] Oh... my shoulder strap... Oh, my orange juice is comin' out... Ha! Gotch—Huh? [Finn throws another rock in, paying no attention to her.] Haha! Jake! "Ker-ploop." Heh heh heh! "Ker-ploop." Not... gotcha? Alright! Ugh! This place is plops, Finn! We can meetcha back at the tree house later if you want. [Continuing on] That weird light... Hey, Finn! Finn, my dress is slipping!! [Not paying attention] Huh? Listen, LSP, we've gotta be carefu— [Swinging around her "dress"] Oooh, my dress...[her dress goes into the portal] No, LSP! It's not safe! Heeeeeeey... [Noticing Finn in a mirror] Oh. Hey, Fiiiiinn... She's stuck in there! We gotta bust through this wall! I knew you couldn't resist me, Finn. [The reflection of Finn takes off his hat revealing long, luscious hair.] Oh, lump. I took it too far! [The Mirror Finns reach out for That was so crazy! What just happened?! Oh. Uh, Bubblegum sent us on a quest to destroy these cursed mirrors. Evil stuff happens when you look into them. Oh, Glob... I had to look because I looked so good! LSP... you don't need a mirror to know you look good. [Sheaths his sword and grabs Lumpy Space Princess's "dress."] You're beautiful on the inside. Like... your brain and stuff! Thanks for sayin' that stuff... and for saving me from those mirror-yous. That was pretty nice. Okay. Time to write. Gonna make this... trashy. Turtle Princess'll be all, [Imitating her] "Oh, my gosh! Number one best-seller!" Hah... Yeah. [She looks around with uncertainty and notices Finn sitting on a log outside.] [To Jake] What's he doing out there? Sometimes, after an adventure, he likes to sit out there and think. [Goes upstairs] [Fearful] Hello? Hey, girl. Are you almost done with your book? Oh... I'm working on it! I've been doing so much research! Did Finn fall victim to your lumps? [Prevaricating] Um... yeah... Great! Bring in your manuscript right away! Click! [Hangs up] [To herself] Yeah... A book about how I'm hot, and Finn only wants... He's so... hot. [Gasps in realization and has flashbacks of Finn from earlier moments in the episode.] ...Finn has the hottest lumps, but his lumps are on the inside! YAAAAGH!! [Pushes equipment off desk in frustration] HE'S GREAT! Uh... Bye, LSP. This isn't what you said it'd be about... I know, I— I LOVE IT! OH, MY GLOB! Finn! You've probably been wondering where I've been for the last few hours! Oh. Yeah! Yeah, I have. Finn... I was never really your secretary, Finn. I was writing a book about how you were a slave to my lumps because I'm so hot, Finn!! [Not seeing anything wrong with this] Oh. Okay. But you're the one who's hot, Finn!! Wow. Uh, thanks! No... thank you. [Goes over to a window and opens it to exit] LSP, YOU'RE WEARING GARBAGE FOR CLOTHES!!!! [Whisper] Gotcha... [Slowly exits and floats away from the tree house. Her floating falters for a moment as the episode ends.] Hello-lable! Cuber? Lable brother? Where are you? Oh, this cave air is doing wonders for my physiological... Bable, bable, bable, bable, bable... Oh! [Falling] Aaaaaaah! Oh! But I'm a baby! Tuber? Sister Tuber? Bable, bable, bable... Aaaaaaah! Hmm? Aah! Oh, you surprised your old pal, 내 신부를 위해 복수할 기다! (I will revenge for my bride!) [Grabs bag of graybles while moving toward his escape pod] Wable. Bable, bable. Bable, bable, bable. Oh! [runs away from crater] Survival! Remember your training. [whimpers, takes out a grayble from bag] Trust your graybles. Oh, and you children at home, don't bother trying to guess tonight's theme. Applesauce to a theme! Your friend [Watching clouds] Oh, come on. [Looks down, sees Finn digging a hole] It's Finn. Hey, Finn! I'm a weather vane! Hey, Finn! I'm a weather vane! Hey, Finn! I'm a weather vane! Hey, Finn! I'm a cliff diver! What?! [walking back toward hole in progress] BMO, you got to let me dig this hole. It's important. A hole, you say? Yeah. We beat this evil wizard, see, and we stole his giant wand. [sitting on a reclining beach chair with a magazine over his face] Don't listen to him, BMO. I beat the wizard, so I'm making Finn dig the hole, even though I could do it in like two seconds. Heh, heh, heh. Rude! This wand is crazy powerful, right? It's a thought cannon. It makes anything that you think of turn real. Up, please. So it's too strong, so we're burying it for safety. I'll tell you what I'd do. I'd use that cannon and imagine a hole. Jake, remember what they say about absolutely power. I'm tired of your wisdom, BMO! [gets up, walks toward wand] Now watch and learn! Yeah, okay, my name's What if for a split second you think of something else? Nope, my brain's my hands! Whoops! Looks like I was thinking about a sandwich. [muffled] Enjoy your labor! Heh, heh, heh. [sighs] I used to wish I was you. Now I just wish you would dig faster. [Grunting while digging] What's this, friends? ["Scrapes the dirt off and pulls the thought cannon from the dirt"] Could it be the aformabled thought cannon? "Bobble, bobble" as the dead might say. That's the power of graybles. [Walking toward hole that Cuber is in] 에잇, 누가던진거야 이거?(Shoot, who threw this thing?) [gasps] 잠깐, 너 방금전...(Wait, you just...) [sighs] I guess here goes bable. [laughs] You try not to think of a sandwich, and look what happens! A sandwich! [Lands in a large puddle in a swamp] Ow! Mama's milk! Oh, my mama's milk! Oh, that milk! Graybles! [snoring in his bed in the [high-pitched voice] "I will marry you, Ice King. I will marry you, Ice King. I will marry you—[Ice King pushes alarm clock off table] [yawns] [smacks lips] Good morning, madness. [takes off blanket, sees right leg bent unnaturally] What?! Broken leg again! [sighs] and... [snaps leg back into place] Hup! [pained] Hello! How are you?! Oh! Gunther, did you see how this happened? I love you, Gunther, but I'm on to your business. Hmm, just like that, huh? And... [snaps leg back into place] Hup! [gurgles, turns white, passes out] You can do it, Cuber. [wakes up, gasps] [inhales sharply, seeing alien ships looking for him] [whimpers] You can do it, [using some sort of surveillance program on a laptop in bed] I see that Mr. Cupcake is at Madam Eclair's apartment again. His massage business is really taking off. Hmm. [breathing heavily] Starchy? Yes, sir. [breathing heavily] Well, I'm just gonna pick these flowers now. [grunts] [looks in grass lard's mouth for place to put tracker tooth] [moaning] No holes. Yeah, in the ear. [to tooth] Oh, I mean, in the rear. That's what all the walking's good for -- gives me self-esteem to have a nice rear. Aah! Oh! No! Agh! Mercy from the wet eyes! [grunting, begins to chase Starchy] Whoa! [whimpers] [roaring] Unh! [moans] Starchy?! Did Starchy just die? [breathing heavily] Hey, hey! Things looking up. [coughs] Mm. [breathing heavily] [removes tracker tooth from grass pile that was the grass lard] Thank you. [grunts, sighs, begins to flop away] [grunts, sighs] S.O.S. -- Save our skin. (in alien language) 저놈 저깄다! (There he is!!) [gasps] Aah! Welcome home, Starchy. Never mind! [breathing heavily] [gasps, shouts] [grunts] [gasps, deflects laser with prize ball] [flies out of prize ball] Oh, what time is it? Oh! Graybles! [in escaping grayble] 떡 많이 먹으면 이렇게 되는거지 뭐~ ("This is what happens when you eat a lot of rice.") [crawls into prize ball] Well, one grayble left. [takes cubic grayble from head] Aah! [gasps] Tuber! Self-actualization, lable brother. You can be a hero, Cuber, and what a cube can be you must be. (in alien language) 아따, 이 봐야될 거 같은디. (Man, you should see this.) 너 뒤에 있다! (Behind you!) I'm a hero! [knocks out alien with prize ball] [in his own burning ship now] Now, wasn't that a thing! We've had laffs and gaffs, thribbles and chibbles, some close calls, secrets and questions, and memories to share. We barely made it out with our scaybles... All thanks to graybles. Sister Tuber? I'm sorry for this mess. I love you. Psh! Haha! Time to protect the sun! Ha ha! Yeah, he knows how to get things started. Firepit number 1. Easy-peasy, livin' greasy! You wonder why they even put it there. It's probably a computel gleetch. [laughs] Now comes some real trouble! It's Bouncy Bee! He's gonna get that sun, man! Haha! Please. [destroys Bouncy Bee on video game] Bleep! [chuckles] I had my eyes closed on that one! Yeah, that was cool. Oh, oh, you missed a coin, dude, go back! I ain't in it for the money, man. I'm in it to crush the enemies of the sun. Like this sloppy butt right here. Hunny Bunny! I'm like, Hunny Bunny, don't you ever learn? I've always got the bomba! [destroys Hunny Bunny on video game] Man, you are hot tonight! Think you can do it this time? Can you beat Sleepy Sam?! Oh, I very can! Remember use a combo move! Okay! Here goes. Up, down, left, left, right, right, down- Spin, down, up, left, faster, dude! Right, left, down! Aww! Every time! [throws controller] BMO, this game is the worst! If we were really inside that game, man, we would crush Sleepy Sam. Breezily! With my mitts! Oh no! It's much more dangerous than you think! Whoa, whoa, wait! BMO, is there a way for us to get in the game for real? Yes, of course, Jake. [opens compartment on self] If I push this button- If I push this button, you will both be dangerously transported into my main brain game frame where it is very dangerous! Oh, man. Oh, BMO! You gotta let us in that game! No! It's a far too dangerous incredible adventure for you! It's final. Oh. Okay, BMO. Well, time for bed! ...Finn? Time for bed. Right, Jake? [ ...oh, right! Heh heh. Good night, BMO. [BMO looks at them suspiciously] Time for bed! [ We're in the game! Look! There's the sunshine we gotta protect! [points to the sun in the video game] And there's a hole we're supposed to go down! [points to a cave] And there's you...doing whatever you're doing. [points to Finn] I'm looking at my bits! My leg is math! Mmm. That sunshine feels good. Feels good all over! No wonder all the monsters in this game want to get their grubby mitts on it! Let's go kick their digital bootays! [8-bit sounds play] Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo doo! Doo! [laughs] Beep boop! Beep boop! ♫ We are in the computer world. We're computer boys, not computer girls. ♫ ♫ In a game, I can be who I virtually am. ♫ ♫ I can walk and sing, I can kill Silly Sam! ♫ [sniffs] Hey, what stinks? [sniffs] Smells like... Pit! [camera shows the pit's width] Looks a mite bigger inside the game... Jumpin' over this pit is easy, remember? We could do this backwards with our eyes closed! [jumps backwards with eyes closed and falls into pit] Ahh! I'm burning! Jake!! Haha. What, man? Whaa?! Jake, what the shake? Check it out! Extra lives! You still have two left! [laughs and jumps into lava pit] Ow! It burns! Ow! Haha! Jake! [sings along with jingle] Dude! What if losing all your lives in here makes you die in real life? Or worse?! ...that makes me just want to sit here and feel bad. No way, man! We're gonna cross that hole! With real-world grit! Come on! Faster, Jake! Get ready to stretch it! Watch out, Jake! [Jake stretches around the flame. They land on the other side, but not before Jake gets burned on his backside.] Ow! Whew! That was pretty intense, dude! We're pretty intense dudes! Yeah! [High-fives Finn] Ha! What's that sound? Sounds like... [both turn around] Bouncy Bee! Whoa! Hi-yah! [Hand slices through air] Oh! [Kicks air.] You ready to flippin' this guy up, Jake? Easy-peasy, livin' greasy! No! [ Finn's dead! Finn! No! [ Yo, what up? Oh, Finn! You're alive! [ Yeah. I got extra lives, man! Oh my gosh. Let's never die again! There's nothing more precious than a life! Ooh, dude, look. Coins! Oh man, oh man! [ Whoa! Hunny Bunny! No! Time to use the bomba! [Camera shows a pixelated bomb on the top of the screen.] Come to me, bomba. [ Let's get outta here, Finn! Man, we've never run away from Hunny Bunny! Firepit, Bouncy Bee, Hunny Bunny. They're supposed to be the easy parts! They're all hard as butts! Sleepy Sam is gonna be the ultimate butt-kicker! Look, Finn. The most important thing to remember is that I still have one giant coin. Man, get a hold of your brains! We need to stay alert for Sleepy Sam! Hey, that's him right there! [ Get down! [Jake and [looking at hands] M-m-my mitts didn't- didn't work! Come on, help me punch him! Okay! Let's get outta here, man! We're gonna die! I can see the light! We're almost there! Oh no, man. It's the edge of the screen! We're trapped and they'll be here any second. Wait, dude! The bomba! We can't get the bomba! Wait, dude. [ Jake? Jake! What if I...? [ That's not how it works! Jake, let go of that! [still holding on] But we need the bomba! Finn! Oh, holy cow! That was nuts, man! Yeah, man. And I got my coin! [looks at coin] What?! A penny?! [BMO starts grunting.] BMO! [Finn and [The hole Jake and Finn came out of is start shooting out blue electric current.] Did you have to- oh no! Wait! Run! No, no, no! Don't kill us, man! No! Aw man, don't kill us! We don't have extra lives! Oh wait. Hold up, guys. Check it out! Sunshine! Oh boy, that feels good! Alright! See ya later, Sam! [ [directed toward Sleepy Sam] You mean, that's it? You're not gonna kill us? [chuckles] Of course not. The game's over; we won! All we wanted was the sunshine. And to kill that computer that's been imprisoning us for so many years. ...what? Help! Oh no! BMO! Oh sure. He's dangerous! If he hits his button again, back we go. BMO, quick! Hit your button! I can't, Finn! I'm stuck! You want him to hit his button? What's wrong with you?! We'll save you, BMO! Finn, go! They're too strong! Use the combo move, Finn! The combo- [Hunny Bunny drenches The combo move? That never works! Listen! You got this, man! I know you- [ [concentrating] Okay, okay. You got this, Whoa. Woohoo! [ Oh, crud! BMO! I'm sorry, buddy! Finn, I told you about the danger! And now look! You fricasseed my stuff and broke our house all up! I know, I know. I was double butt. For real. [Scene shows BMO looking annoyed.] Man! Now that we know what to expect, next time will be way more fun! Yeah, yeah! How 'bout it, BMO? You in? [ Hey! Don't do the combo move on us! We were only joking! BMO! Stop messing around! Okay, Starchy. Now! I'm on it! Do I - Do I just pull this lever? [A roll of film is ejected out the back of the camera.] No! [He pulls out some replacement film and closes the camera again.] I'm on it. Excellent. These photos will help us find out what sort of forces Gumbald has amassed before we mobilize our troops. What's that, dear? These photos will help us find out - [She is interrupted by Colonel Candy Corn.] I'm glad there's going to be another proper war before I kick the bucket. Wipe 'em out! Hey, Princess. Finn, you donked up my recon! I've got some important stuff to say. [He inhales deeply.] I don't think going to war with your uncle is a good idea. I don't have any choice. By building an army, he's forcing my hand. It seems to me that all these rhubarbs down through history don't do nobody no good. [Throwing away the ruined photograph as well as her gloves and apron] Finn, we all love how sweet you are, but sometimes we just have to buckle down and do things the ugly way. Excuse me. [She exits.] It's gonna happen, son. Best thing to do is sharpen your sword and stock up on flower wreaths. [He exits.] You're dark, Colonel Candy Corn. How'd it go? No good. PB is on the road to war. Jake, it's up to us to fix things with Uncle Gumbald. Didn't he try to kill you with monsters made out of your own baby teeth? Take that banana face! [Uncertainly] Uh, take this, you banana face. Does everyone have to get caught up in this mentality? I'm going to march right over to Gumbaldia on a last-ditch diplomatic mission. Want to come? [Excitedly] Do I? [He climbs onto Finn's head and shape-shifts to look like Finn's hat.] This is cute, right? You bet! And that's the number one priority for kick-butt diplomacy - the cuteness offensive! Hey, this is kinda backwards, right? How so? I used to be all about violence. Now it's, like, I'm different. You're a beautiful flower and I love to watch you grow. Halt! Gumbald? None shall pass. [Growling] Fern. [Whispering to Finn] Cuteness offensive. [He clicks his tongue again.] [Sighs] Okay. [Calling out to the Green Knight.] I don't wanna fight! I'm just here to see your boss. Fern, I know we have beef, but let's just talk. I didn't even know you were alive. [Scoffs] You thought you had beaten me? [He shapes his arm into a blade.] Me?! Cool sword. Fern, stop! I used to want to be you. Now I'm a better you! [He opens his helmet, revealing Fern's face.] I've proved it. There's nothing you have that I don't. [Retracting back over Finn's face] Bark! Bark, bark, bark, bark! Bark, bark, baraaaah! Boys! Boys! [She walks out onto the terrace above the fighting.] Stop all this roughhousing! [Sighs] Yes, Aunt Lolly. "Aunt Lolly" - she sounds kind of like mom, yeah? Hey! She was my mom too! I know, man. We're like family. So why are we fighting? [Walking down the steps to meet Finn and Jake] Sorry about him. Now what's a sweet boy like you doing here? I'm trying to stop this ridiculous war. I mean, this whole thing is crazy, right? Between you and me, honey, I don't want war either. Gumbald is becoming so paranoid and erratic. All he talks about is baking that wretched, wretched cake. Maybe you can talk some sense into him. Did you say he's baking a cake? Aah! A breach! [Running away] But my secret plan is to never die! So, it begins. [He taps a button on his wrist and an alarm starts blaring.] Wait! I'm a diplomacy boy today! Gumbald! He's just here to talk. [She takes his wrist and turns off the alarm.] [Snatching away his wrist] Traitor! I think we can trust him. [Whispering to Jake] Stop. [To Finn] I'll hear your case boy, but I've got a busy day. We'll have to walk and talk. Look, PB doesn't want to attack you. You're gum from the same sidewalk. Like, just look at this bomb secret laboratory over here. This is exactly the kind of thing PB would have. [Slams the door to the laboratory so that Finn can't see inside, and holds up photographs of the Candy Kingdom's war preparations.] Then why is she building up her arms? [He scatters the photos at Finn's feet. He points at his arm.] You see this? This is her forcing my hand. [He grabs his wrist and moves it back and forth.] But that's exactly what she's saying. You're both so unreasonable. You want unreasonable? Get a load of my unreasonably bad boy battle automaton! Her name is The Cake. [He gestures up at The Cake, which fills the chamber they are now standing in.] My niece would never have the ambition for a project like this. But ambition is my whole deal! You want a closer look, boy? I grant it to you. This magnificent dessert shall make the whole war relatively swift and painless. So there's truly nothing I can say to change your mind? Princess Bubblegum has made her bed, and now she must lie in it. But not get back up because she'll be dead. [Laughs evilly.] I was wrong about you. You're nothing like Bonnie. Wait. She'll have her cake and eat it too - because she'll be dead! The Cake makes her dead! What the - No! No, no, no, no, no! Aah! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. The pain is astonishing. You could have let me die and saved your princess a lot of trouble. Maybe there is a way to co-exist after all. [Looking straight ahead.] Hey-o. That's what I like to hear. Sorry. I'm worried if I turn my neck my head might snap off. So Jake is literally inside me, controlling my body and I'm standing in front of my girlfriend's entire family. [Apparently engrossed in the story] No! This is my first ever girlfriend. I really want her to like me. So then I made him do a diaper baby dance! [Laughs] You're as funny as me - the funny one! Thanks, Chicle. But, if I could get serious for a second - No need, Finn. Your example has said more than words ever could. Chicle, fetch the celebration bucket. I declare all hostilities between Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Celebration bucket! [He throws a bucket of glittery pink liquid over Finn and Jake.] Be sure to give Bonnie a big hug from me when you tell her. You guys are goofballs. [Shaking himself off.] Blblblblbl! [Gasps] Don't look at me! [He runs to an adjacent room and slams the door. Pink smoke poofs out from underneath. Everyone else is silent for a second.] Now there's a guy who - who really cares about his hair! [Together] Oh, cousin Chicle! Man, I almost thought that was something really serious. I don't believe it. A signed peace treaty? Finn, you're amazing. I could hug you right no- ...Did you stop at a craft store on the way here? Oh, the glitter juice. It's part of a weird Gumbaldia treaty-signing ritual. Once I got to know him, your uncle was actually pretty cool. As I get older, I see the most important thing is to empathize with my friends and enemies. Like, co-exist instead of cutting off people's heads and stuff. [Squeaks] Peps? [Cooing and dancing] [Sniffs] You've been doused with Gumbald's dumdum solution! [Growls and then yells out] Gumbald! Where are you going!? [Yelling] Candy citizens, we are going to war! Hoopty hoo, hoopty hey! Let's cut 'em up, folks. [Laughs] I donked up. Don't halt. Continue running. I command it. My thanks to you all for joining me here today. I hope you're enjoying the hors d'oeuvres. [Whispers indistinctly in Gumbald's ear.] It seems that the Princess avoided our attempt at a peaceful resolution. But it was still a good plan... Aunt Lolly. This magnificent dessert shall make the whole war relatively swift and painless. Eh, I love to plan. Hey. What's a plan? Oh, cousin Chicle, you've still got it. Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to unleash plan B. My formidable legion of Candy Kingdom haters. Ricardio, Bandit Princess, Samantha the warrior dog, Peacemaster, Me-Mow, Pete Sassafrass, Ash the Warlock, Sir Slicer, Scorcher, the Green Knight, and finally, the Iced King. Uh, I think I might be here by mistake. What are we doing again? It's Gum War! [calling] Jake! Jake! [coming out of bushes] Jake? [sees Jake's viola resting on a rock] Hmmm... [picks it up and starts playing it poorly] [off screen] Aaaah! [comes out of bushes covering his ears] Aaaaah! [rolls on ground] Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl! [gets up and knocks the viola out of Finn's hands] Uh! That sounded horrible, man! [picks up viola] I don't know how to play. Exactly! [starts tuning viola] Huh? Let's go! [runs toward screaming] Oh, wait up. I gotta finish tuning my viola. Soft People! Why are you all in a tizzy? The Gut Grinder! He's back! The "Gut Grinder?" Yes, the Gut Grinder is a gold-eating monster. In the past, the Soft People of this village enjoyed piling our gold in the center of town and dancing wildly around it. It was awesome [laughs]! But then, the Gut Grinder came and stole our pile of gold. So we adapted and learned how to hide our gold using a big cup. And it worked! The Gut Grinder didn't come back! But recently, and admittedly it was probably a bad idea, we took our gold out from under the cup and we put it in the center of town. Haha, 'cause--'cause we really like dancing around it! But, boy oh boy, was that a mistake. You know what happened? Uhhh... it came back and ate all your gold? [crying] Yes, oh, yes! Aw, don't cry, Soft Old Man. I'll find this monster and bring peace to this village. I swear! Swear to what? I swear to justice! Whoa! He swears to justice! Okay, so, what does he look like? Ohh, it's so scary we usually close our eyes and go wee-wee when he attacks. But... [walks over to footprint] he left this footprint... [Jake (giant-sized) storms in] Wha--? [putting his foot in the print] Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo! Look! His paw matches the footprint! I'm so scared, I'm gonna go wee-wee! Whoa, no, no-no-no-no! Calm down, everybody. This is my friend, Jake the Dog. [sigh] Thank goodness. Yeah--I almost wee-wee'd! Wait, you were gonna wee-wee if I was the Gut Grinder? Oh, yeah! We're terrified of him. [loudly] Then I am the Gut Grinder! I'm gonna wee-wee! [squirts liquid out of its armpits and spins around in a circle] [laugh] That guy wee-wees weird. I'm just kiddin', everybody. I'm not the Gut Grinder. I'm... [shrinks back to normal size] Aw, he's just a cute little dog! Hey, I'm not cute! [running up to Jake] Doggy! [petting Jake] Pet, pet, pet! [laughs] Huh? Oh, heheh. [closes his eyes, purrs, drools] Pfft. What?! I didn't say anything. [to villagers] People of the village of Soft People, I, Come on, let's go, Jake. [getting a belly rub] Oh... heheh. What? No! [Finn grabs him and drags him away] Noooo... Bye-bye, doggy! [still being dragged by Finn] Bye, Soft Village. Hey Finn, my feet fit these prints pretty well. Hm, what if I really am the Gut Grinder? [laughs nervously] Dude, your paws'll fit anything. [laugh] That is true. Check this out. [shrinks his feet to fit Finn's prints and walks in them; says mockingly] I'm Finn the Human and I stink at viola! [imitating Jake] I'm Jake the Dog and I put my nose in poop. There's a lot of interesting smells in poop. Huh? [sees that it's coming from Cube Village] Hey Cube People, what's going on here? The Gut Grinder stormed into our village and ate all of our gold! [emerging from behind a building] Wait, what happened? Aaah! The Gut Grinder! Whoa, no, no, no! He's not the Gut Grinder! He's my friend! We saw the Gut Grinder and he looks exactly like him! [laughs nervously] Th-that's ridiculous. Jake, back to your normal size. Oh yeah. [shrinks down, starts dancing] Ooh ooh ooh. [sings] I am not... the Gut Grinder. Ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh. Aw, he's just a cute little dog. Hey! Y'all are the ones who are cute. I'm hot. Aw, look--he's all mad! Even cuter. Aaah! [running over to Jake] So cute! [hugs him, rubs his belly] Aw, so cute, so cute! I'm not cute! I'm--mnh, [closes eyes] ooh. We are also seeking the Gut Grinder. Me and my friend Jake will find it and slay it! Tell us what he looked like. Exactly like him, [points to Jake] but bigger. [getting belly rubbed] Ruff, ruff, grrrr... [continues making dog sounds] Huh... Which way did he go? Jake! Hey, come on! Wha--? [getting up] Where am I? [running left] Thanks, guys! [following Finn] I'm not cute. I'll mess you up. Finn...? What if I am the Gut Grinder? What?! What if I'm, like, stealing gold in my sleep? You can't be stealing gold in your sleep--I watch you while you sleep. Wha--? Yo, Finn, that is creepy, man. I can't help it. I take pictures. Well, when do you sleep? Justice never sleeps. Well, there's gotta be a time when you're not watchin' me... that--that I--that I might be stealin' gold unconsciously! [into Jake's ear] You... are... not... the... Gut... Grinder! [worried moan] City in danger! City in danger! Let's go! Oh, wait--what if these guys think you're the Gut Grinder? Hmm... [snaps fingers] Ah-ha! [reaches into his pack] Got the perfect thing for ya [pulls out glasses] Groucho glasses! [places glasses on a lump of Jake's fat] I love it! [kisses lump, hides his face by moving it to his chest] Launch in 3, 2, 1! [jumps toward Spiky Village] Woohoo! Yeah! Oh, man! These people are a mess! Halt! Identify yourselves immediately! I am [moving lump] I'm Groucho! We're on a mission to catch the Gut Grinder. [gasp] I am the mayor of this village. Our gold has just been stolen by the very monster you speak of. I hereby vow to catch that thief and bring your gold back! Our people thank you. I present to you this photo [Spiky Person enters carrying a photograph] of the Gut Grinder to help in your mission. [takes photo] Oh, thanks. [quietly] Wha--? [looking at photo] Finn, it's me! [crumbles photo into a ball; says quietly] Well, duh, it looks like you. [puts photo in pocket] We already knew that. It's just one of those weird coincidences--like how my belly button looks like your face. Yeah, I-I know you think it does, Finn--but this is different. I'm scared, Finn. [starts shaking nervously] Jake, stop it! Wha--? Oh, it's the Gut Grinder! No, no-no-no-no! He's not the Gut Grinder! I swear on my good name... and justice... and Jake's cute face! His face is weird. The truth is obvious your friend is the Gut Grinder! NOOOOOO! [as Spiky People put Jake in jail.] You are under arrest for stealing our gold. [running up to Jake] I'll get you out of here... somehow. No, Finn... I belong behind bars. Look at the evidence--I really am the Gut Grinder. Buddy, listen to me. You've been my best friend for as long as I can remember! That's enough evidence to prove to me that you're not a monster! Then... why am I in jail? Only Gut Grinders go to jail. I'm in jail and I'm not the Gut Grinder. [catches a grub] I'm here for the free grub. [puts grub in his mouth] Hehehehehe! [his gold tooth gleams] Huh? Wait, I got an idea! Hey, Gut Grinder! I got some gold here that you missed. Come and get it! Huh. Whoa, you're the Gut Grinder? [rubbing Jake's belly] Oh, Gut Grinder. Oh, Gut Grinder... you're a little cutesy. You're a little cutesy-wootsy. Huh? Grrrr... not cute. [thinking] Am I the Gut Grinder? [looks through bars at Gut Grinder stepping on Finn] All the clues fit! [sees gold tooth] I must be the Gut Grinder! [as Gut Grinder, aloud] And I want GOLD! [catching tooth] Woohoo! Yeah! We got him! Thanks for saving me, Jake! [as Gut Grinder] Grrrr! I'm not What? Jake? [Jake chomps at him] Whoa! [panting] Whoa! [as Gut Grinder] Rawr! Now give me that tooth! If I give you this stupid tooth, will you stop being a crazy jerk?! [snatches tooth, tosses it into his mouth, and laughs while walking away] What the--? Jake! You never turn into a monster when I want you to. It's always, "Not now, [as Gut Grinder] Huh? [comes back] Ah, stay away from my viola! Jake, you remember your viola! [as Gut Grinder] I also remember that you stink hard at playing it. And dookie is radical, man! I don't care what anyone says. [shakes head; normal voice] Wha--huh? What? Where am I? Finn, is that you? Who else would it be, baby? Whoo! [shrinks to normal size] I guess I went nuts. You were so crazy, man! Like--like, actually crazy. [burps up tooth, laughs] [patting Jake's back] It's good to have you back. It's good to have you pat my back. [scratching Jake] Man, if I had known you were so easily manipulated, I would have eaten more of your ice cream. [pushes Finn away] Cut it out! Cut open the Gut Grinder's belly! What the--? [Sharon comes out of the pile of gold] What the--? Sharon, what are you doing in the Gut Grinder? [murmuring] That's the mayor's wife! [holding skin] And the Gut Grinder's skin is not skin at all--it's cloth! Sharon! Have you been sewing?! [unapologetically] Yes, Cameron. I've been stealing gold. WHY, SHARON?! Because I like to buy things, Cameron! I like to shop! And I dressed up like Jake because I think he's hot. You have been a naughty girl, Sharon. [turns to guards] Guards! Throw my wife in jail. [turns to Finn and Jake] Finn and Jake, thank you for saving my Spiky Village. [gives thumbs up] No problem, mayor. Now give us a hug. No, don't do that! Don't hug us! [Spiky People start hugging] Don't touch me! AAAAAAAAAH! Ow! Hey! Don't touch us! OWWWW! No more luddite. I've got nanite. I hope muffins aren't easy to make or I'm being an idiot. [PB takes off her goggles] Nanites! Wait. Hold it. Stop making muffins!!! [Points at the muffins, touching them] Nanite, stop! Aaaah! [She looks at her arm stub] Aaaah! [Looks at Finn and sighs, then answers the ringing phone.] Hello. What's shakin'? [Reshaping her fingers.] Jake, it's Bonnie. Can you dudes get over here? I need your help with a catastrophe. Ehh, I dunno. Finn's got rat germs all through his body. [groans] I'll do it. You up to this, champ? [Finn coughs] Ok, well, it's pretty complicated. Firstly, you need to not touch the muffins, especially with your unprotected skin. And you need to find the alpha nanite and deactivate it before the muffin pestilence grey goos all the way to the edge of the continent. Yup. [Exits, breathing heavily.] Brave little soldier, up on muffin hill. [pathetically] Mathematiclablaughh. [He falls down onto the pile of muffins, then lets out a dry cough.] [shouting] Attention! I bring a message from the microscopic world! We can see you  when you go number one! [Walks away]] Beware! Beware! Beware! Huh! Man, I still can't believe Marceline is 1,000 years old and has never seen Heat Signature. This movie is gonna blow their minds. Marceline! We brought Heat Signature. Woot! Woot! Woo! Hey, so I want you all to meet Finn and Jake. They aren't... completely lame. Whatup? Guys, this is Wendy... Hey. Booboo... Hello. Hello. ...and Georgy. Hey. We used to be in a gang together back in the underworld. Hmm. Yeah, that's pretty sweet. Hope y'all like getting your minds blown, cause it's showtime. [groans in pain] What is wrong with this couch? Ehh, that made my teeth hurt. Oh yeah. Sorry, I don't ever really sit on there. I just float usually. We... kinda all do. Aww, what? man, no fair. Yeah, well, too bad you're not vampires. So, anyways, I... Wait! Hold on just a second. Marceline, we insist you turn us into vampires. Or ghosts, or whatever. We just wanna fly. All right, all right. Fine. Yes! Come on, Marceline! you're gonna turn these goofballs? [giggles] Don't worry, I've got something more fun in mind. [She whispers to the ghosts. Finn and Jake are exhausted from jumping up and down.] Okay, Marceline, we're ready now. Okay, hold that thought. [She floats into the next room.] Huhuuuhhuh... I'm gonna perform the biting ritual. You guys close your eyes and don't open them until I say so. If you do... your heads will EXPLODE! Okay, Finn. You first. Bite. Chomp. Boop boop. Boop. Boop. Okey dokey. All done. How do you guys feel? Pretty... much... the same. My neck sort of hurts. Don't you feel a little hungry...for blood? [moaning] I felt it. Jake, do you feel it? Yeah, I could go for some blood. [gasps] Oh no. Jake. Now we're gonna have to drink blood for all eternity. [gasps] Yeah, what if we turn evil? I'll hafta start wearing cologne. Relax, guys. You can satisfy your bloodlust without killing. Look. [She drains the red from the apple until it is pale.] You just eat the color. Here, Jake. You try. [She hands the other apple to Jake.] Ugh. Come on. Sorry, bro. [While Finn and Whooooa... Marceline, can we float now? Mmm... Not yet. That's a really advanced power. First, you gotta go through vampire orientation. Huhuuuhhuh... Think you chumps can handle it? Oh, baby, yeah, baby, baby, baby, yeah, baby, yeah, yeah. Okay, guys, the first phase of vampire orientation is learning... [Catches a firefly and puts it in her mouth.] ...invisibility. [She turns invisible. Finn reaches out to touch the firefly in her mouth and chuckles nervously] [nervous chuckle] Ah! Hey! [She slaps Finn but catches him before he hits the ground. You ready for the power of...invisibility? With all my heart. Good. Now, spin! Give it a whirl, Jake! [Then she sends Jake spinning until he falls to the ground.] Now chant, "INVISIBLE!INVISIBLE!" INVISIBLE!INVISIBLE! [They spin to a stop. They get up groaning dizzily.] Yup. It worked? [gasp] We're invisible! [He punches Finn in the stomach.] You're invisible! [He punches Jake in the stomach.] Hey. Then how come we can see each other? Because you guys become vampires at the same time. So you are forever linked. AWW YEAH! [They do a stomach five, and spin around, laughing.] [laughs] Marceline...you're friends with some real morons. [Georgy and Wendy grimace.] Oh, my glob, Melissa. Ever since Clara stopped eating meat, her skin looks so good. I mean, she still looks fat, but like, I can't say that junk to her face. Wow! LSP's a hobo! Let's mess with her. I'm doing so awesome on my own. Like, right now, I found this can of beans. Finn? Jake! Put down my stuff! [gasps] She knows it's us. She must recognize our voices. Let's disguise them. [Romanian accent] We're invisible! Melissa, I have to go. They got into my toilet paper. Melissa, I have to go! [hangs up] Give it back, you guys! Weeeee! Yeah! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah, Jake! [in slow motion] Nooooooooo! MY BEANS!!! [Angrily, she hits Finn and Jake. Georgy, Wendy, and Booboo laugh at the sight.] Time to join in on the fun! You guys ruined everything! I'm gonna kill you! But we're undead. [An axe suddenly appears to float in midair. LSP suddenly gasps and faints at the sight.] Geez, we really scared her. Nice vampire scare, guys. Thanks. Yeah, pretty good, fellas. [The ghosts chuckle.] You guys ready...for the next vampire lesson? [They all stick out what would be a foot. Marceline stares.] You know we are. Good. [The ghosts all start kicking Finn and Jake.] Ow! What's the point of this lesson? Kick 'em harder! [They do so. Bruises appear on Finn and Jake as they yelp in pain.] Ow! It hurts! Ohhh! Okay, everyone! Stop the toughness lesson! What? Finn, Jake. You guys okay? We're okay. [coughs] It's all worth it. See? They're fine. When did you go all soft? You used to like teaching people about kicks. [Marceline stares.] Hey, guys, I think you're ready to learn how to float. All you have to do is jump off that ledge. [He glances up towards some derelict structures in the distance.] Cool. [gasps] W-wait! There's more beginner lessons you need to learn before floating. Like... uh... the spooky vampire walk. See? Spoooooky... wooo! Heh heh. No way. We wanna fly! You guys stop right now. Marceline, chill out. It's going to be okay. We've got a plan. [to Finn and Jake] Now, get in your flying positions. [ VAMPIRES FOREVER!!! WOOO! What are you guys waiting for? You said you had a plan. We do. It's to let them die! [The ghosts start laughing.] We did it! Yeah! Woohoo! Awesome! Way to go, Marceline. Hey, you guys need to stop trying to kill my friends! They gotta die someday. Hey! Let's invite them to our place! When they show up... We'll suck their guts out through their brains! Did you see us? Yeah, you guys were pretty amazing. Hey, we're gonna throw a party... in honor of your new vampire skills. Holy snaps, that's awesome! They're lying to you guys. They just wanna suck the guts out of the top of your head. What? She's just jealous of you. We'll see you at midnight at our place. [The ghosts turn invisible. Finn and Jake turn toward Marceline.] Guys, promise me you're going to that party. We're not gonna go. You're not? Nah. I'm kinda tired from doing vampire stuff all day. We're just gonna chill. Oh. Okay. Well, we're going back home. Peace. Number 25, Blood Drive. [ Uh... [He shrieks in horror as one of the ghosts puts a mouth on his head. Jake tries to punch the ghosts' mouths away, but one gets him from behind.] Georgy, what's wrong? Jake, what's happening? I think they're testing our vampire abilities. Oh, sweet. VAMPIRE KICK! [ Aw, come on. Will you knock it off already? You know you're not even real vampires. Pssh. Then why am I flying, Wendy? [realizes] Oh. [The chandelier breaks loose. finn falls screaming to the floor.] Yo, man. I think Marceline tricked us. Yeah. VAMPIRE KICK!!! [She kicks the ghosts' mouths away.] Finn. Jake. I'm so sorry I got you into this. I should've never pranked you so perfectly. It's okay. You're here now to beat up those ghosts and save us. Oh, no, vampires can't beat ghosts. It's sort of a Rock-Paper-Scissors thing. I just came to apologize. Aw, man. [The ghosts' mouths pick up Jake and Uh... did you guys say... Heat Signature? Have you located the enemy's heat signature, Private? Yes, sir. But I also noticed something... strange. Something... I can't explain. Well, spit it out, man! I... I... I can't seem to locate... our heat signature. [groans in frustration] This stink-ups mega bam-bam to the J-stop. Could we just go back to the brain-eating or whatever? MMM-HMM. After the movie. Well, can't we just-- Shhh! Shut! [off screen] Look out, Commander! [off screen] Aaaagh! My heat signature! Hahahaha! Here I go! Yeah! [Sliding down skeleton] Whoo-hoo!! Hmm... Awesome! [He and Jake laugh. Suddenly, crying is heard.] Someone needs our help! [To her henchman] What is it about "henchman for life" that you don't understand? Oh, come on! [Whispering to Jake] Dude! It's Marceline the Vampire Queen! Can't you find the compassion to release this poor old body? "Henchman for life" means, "henchman for life!!" [Whispering to Jake] You still petrified of vampires? [Prevaricating] No... I'm not... [To old man] Fall on the ground for me! Yes, Mistress. [He does so.] Now cry for me! Okay. I don't want to cry, but I shall cry for you. [He begins weeping.] [Running from behind bushes] Hey! Cut that out! Oh! If it isn't my favorite little goodie-two-shoes Finn! Stop making this poor old dude cry! I can make him do whatever I want. Watch. Henchman, amuse me. Stop it! Now hop around in a circle. Oh, no. Don't worry, sir. I'll see to it you get set free. Oh, and how're ya gonna pull that off, hero? I'll do what I need to. I'll even take his place! Dude, what?! Do you mean it? Uh... well... [He looks at the old man who is groaning tiredly.] Heck yeah! Deal! Old henchman, you're free. Whoo-hoo! [Leaps off happily] What're you doing, man? Hey, Jake.... BLEH!! [She makes a horrific face.] EEH! [Grabs onto Finn] I couldn't watch that old man suffer, Jake. My code of honor wouldn't allow it. [Laughs] [Mocking Finn] "Oh, my code of honor wouldn't allow it." [Cackles] Rrrr... HEY! Yes, Jake? [Transforms into a werewolf creature] What would you like to talk about?! AAAH! [Runs to Finn's side] I wanna help you outta this, man, but... she scares the filling out of my doughnut. Let's just leave. I can't. As a hero, I'm bound by my [Taken by Marceline into the air] WOOOOORD!! FINN! [Marceline cackles as they fly into the air.] Don't worry, dude! I'll figure something out!! You're lucky, Finn. Your first job as henchman is to help me feed. [Gasps; to himself] Feed?! What does she mean? L-Like, like, oats? Like, sentient beings, or oats?! It doesn't matter! I can handle it! Sounds like dinner. Finn, open the door. [Finn walks up to the door and strains himself.] OPEN IT ALREADY! No way, Marceline! I'm not gonna open this door if innocent people will be hurt! Aren't you bound by your word to do as I say, hero? I... [Sighs] Yes... [Turns and walks towards door] Huh? Sorry about this. [Scared] Haah! Hold him down! [Finn groans. No! [To himself] Rrr... Don't you worry, Finn. I'll get you outta there. I've got a perfect plan! [Marceline laughs. She notices Please, human boy! Let me go! I'm sorry, sir. I'm bound by my code of honor to do what she says. I understand, son. I was married myself once. [A single tear drops from his right eye.] Wait, wait! I'm not married to— [Frustrated] Ugh! Enough talking! Dinner is served! No! [Pulls Eberhardt away before Marceline could bite him; Marceline attacks again.] No! [Pulls him away again] How dare you, henchman?! I order you to let me feed! NOOOOO!!! Mmm. That red bow tie was delicious! [Grunts] Huh? [Arms uncurl] What's wrong, Finn? I... I thought you were— Oh, my! A white tie! Thank you so much! This is so beautiful! [Passes out] B-but... What? You know I eat the color red sometimes. [Winks] Oh... Yeah... Okay... We've got plenty more evil to do! [Laughs] [Thinking] Man... What's wrong with this girl? I can't tell if she's messin' with me, or... or what. Hey, Finn. You thinkin' about how that guy's bow tie sorta looked like a bra? Huh? No! I know this place seems a little dead, but don't worry. It'll soon be undead. [Finn whimpers.] Corpses buries in mud that's black, from death I command you to come back! [The dead bodies rise out of the ground. ("Eeehhh... What's happening? Eh...")] Hahaha! Are you ready to lead an evil army of the undead?! Uhh, NEVER! [A skeleton grabs [To himself] Don't worry, dude. I'm comin' to help you. YAAAAH!! [Charges out of bushes with a stake towards Marceline] Huh? What's that noise? [To himself] Sorry, Finn. Excited to hear the wild screams of an entire castle? [Faking] Haha, aw, yeah, that sounds bombastic, honey! Hey, I'm gonna run up ahead and scout it out for you, sugar! [Runs hurriedly] Hahaha! Yeeees? Duke and Duchess of Nuts' residence! My boss is gonna sack your castle! Oh! Well, that's certainly bad news for us! Lisby! Who's at the door? Someone who wishes to sack the nut castle! Why would you want to sack my nut castle on my second son's first birthday?! SEIZE HIM! No! [The army draws closer.] Listen! You hear that?! My master is marching here with her army of the undead! Oh! How wonderful! Listen to me!! [The army arrives.] EVERYBODY!! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!! Hahaha! [She flies into the palace.] I wrote this next song about a fisherman. [She sings the Fisherman Song.] Don't do this, Marceline! I beg you! Don't do what? You're late, Marceline! My son has been dying to hear your undead music! Wha?! Oh, I forgot! Marceline is playing tonight! Okay... So, she makes things seem bad, a-and then... or-or her personality makes them seem bad, or... [Sighs] I'm over-reacting. Hey! Huh? Why are you thinking so hard?! Just party hard! Whoo! Alright! Whoo-hoo! Hahahaha! Hey, castle-crasher! Hey, Marceline! You like cute things, right? Uh, yeah, sure. Why? Then you might love this. The cutest dimple plant ever! Whoa-ho-ho! That's cool! Here, eat some of its fruit. See what happens. [He does so. Okay, henchman, now... I need you to do something. What is it? I want you to take this dimple plant outside, and kill it! What?! [Pulling it out] Use my ax bass. I'm gonna murder you. I'm not entirely sure why. I'm sure this will end happy... [ [Entering] There is no twist. Kill it now! But wh— You should've hacked it to pieces when it was still adorable... I-I thought— [The monster attacks Oh, boy... [She simply detaches one of its limbs to kill the monster. Finn axes himself free.] Not bad... for a henchman. [Smiling] Hmm... Hey. Can't the sun, like, destroy you? Yeah, it hurts, but I kinda like it. Reminds me of when I'd scrape my knees up as a kid, and my mom would patch me up... you know what I'm sayin'? Uh... Jake told me I came out of a cabbage. Hey, Finn, I need you to strangle some pixies. Yeah, sure. That sounds good. Whoa, why are you being so casual about that? Strangling pixies is some hardcore evil. I'm not fallin' for your junk anymore, lady! You just like sayin' poop that jacks with my brain! [Breaking] What are you talking about? I... [Laughs] Dang, man, I didn't think you'd ever catch on! [Laughs] I knew it! Hey... what about your old henchman? Who was that guy? Oh, just an old diving buddy. [Jake emerges from the bushes.] [Jokingly] So, you ready to go strangle some pixies? Yeah, man! I mean, wo-man. [To himself] Oh, no! My buddy is totally under her vampire spell! [Yelling out] Die, unholy thing! [Throws garlic at her] Jake? [The garlic hits her.] Ow! [She drops her umbrella and hisses loudly as she stares at the sun. She moans as she falls on the ground and withers.] Marceline! I'm stakin' that vampire and settin' you free, no matter how terrified I am! She's alright, man! She's still controlling your mind with evil! Now, back off and let me vanquish her from existence! I can't let you do that, Jake! [Sighs deeply] I love you, brother. YAAAH! [Attacks Finn, forcing him to the ground] Jake, listen! Marceline is not how she seems! She's a radical dame who likes to play games! What are you even talkin' about, dude?! Oh, man! [Kicks Jake off his person] MARCELINE! [ [Faking] I-I'm free! Jake! You faced your fear and saved me! I did?! I did! Yeah! [singing] I saved my bro from a scum-sucking vampire!! [Runs away and laughs triumphantly.] [Whispering] Is it cool? Yup! Finn, I owe you big-time! Changing into a bat and hiding in your pack was genius! That's what henchmen are for. Oh, uh, that reminds me. You're fired from your henchman-ship. It's no fun when I can't trick you. We're still on for pixie-strangling tomorrow, though, right? [Flying away with the umbrella] Definitely. You want some more eggs, BMO? Yes, please. [Gives BMO more eggs] How 'bout you, Finny? Need a refill? I'm pretty full, man... but lemme see if I can... rearrange. [Tries to move food in his stomach but fails] Nope. Can't do it. I don't know if stomachs work like that, dude. Sometimes it helps. Can't argue with that! [Relaxes] Ahh... [Relaxing] Ahh... [Moving arms up] Ahh... [Answering] Hello? Lady, it's gonna be fine. Mm-hmm. Alright, I love you, too. Bye. [Hangs up] Lady Rainicorn again? Yeah, man. She's worried about introducing me to her parents at lunch today. She thinks they're gonna freak out. Um... maybe give her parents some treasure? No way! That's our treasure! Wait. I've got it, dude! I'll invite them over early, smooth them over using my personality, and we'll all be best friends before Lady gets here so she doesn't have to feel nervous! It's perfect! I'll just send them a quick Prism-gram. [Begins writing] Mm-hmm. [He finishes and sends the message. The reply comes within seconds.] What's it say? Hold on. It's still converting the light waves into brain waves. [The crystal shoots a beam into his head.] Ahh... They're into it, dude! Sweet! Let's go powder our noses! Why's Lady so nervous, anyway? Well... she didn't really say, but it might have somethin' to do with the Rainicorn-Dog Wars. There were wars between rainicorns and dogs? Horrifying wars. For thousands of years, rainicorns battled dogs over territory in the Crystal Dimension... but Lady and I are cool. Dude! Her parents are probably all full of dog-hatred from the war-times! They're gonna see you're a dog and forbid Lady from ever hanging out with you again! ...Nah. That could never happen. You didn't think this through enough... IT COULD HAPPEN!! AAAH! I'M A MORON! Don't worry. I've got a plan that's gonna solve this biz. Homies help homies. Always. I'm ready to hear your plan, homie. Haha, yeah! This plan is perfect! You know, I thought painting ourselves rainbow-color using condiments and stuff from the fridge so we could pretend to be rainicorns was a good idea when you pitched it to me five minutes ago, but now I'm not so sure, man. Come ooonnn. Trust me, homie. [Worried] No, no, no, new plan. First, we're gonna clean this place up, and then— [Doorbell rings] Huh?! Jake? AAAAH... [To Finn] LET'S HIDE AND BURN THE HOUSE DOWN! [Knocking] Hello? [they have universal translators] 안녕하세요. ("Hello.") Jake, is that you? Uh-huh. Are you going to let us in? Y-yeeeaaah... [Opens door] AAAAAAHHHH!!! I can explain!! I can explain!! OOOHHHHH, he's so handsome! Oh, Bob, our daughter's finally found a handsome rainicorn to love! You think I'm a rainicorn? I think we can spot a member of our own species, Jake. We're not blind. Well, we are a little blind. Yes, I guess we are a little blind. Uh, well, hey! Come on in! It's awesome to finally meet you both! Your house is very colorful. I like that! [Whispering to Jake] Haha! The plan is working, homie! Jake, what is that thing that's talking? Uh... that's um... I'm Jake's rainicorn roommate! Everyone do the traditional rainicorn rain dance! [Starts chanting and dancing] Jake, please ask your goblin butler to stop insulting my heritage! Uh... y-yes! [To Finn] Get outta here, goblin! Go fetch us some rainicorn snacks! But— [Whispering] Come on, homie, help me! [Smiles] [Whispering] Ha! You got it, homie! Uh... please, c-come upstairs. My goblin will bring us snacks in a moment. Thank you, Jake. I'm glad the wife and I made the trip from the Crystal Dimension. Yes, we're eager to know more about the studly young rainicorn that's dating our daughter. Ethel... Well, ask me whatever you like, Ethel, Bob! I am a little curious about your goblin. He looks a little odd. Well... he's actually a human. Oh, Bob! Our future-son-in-law must be filthy-rich to afford a human butler! Shh. [To Jake] Thank you, Jake, for being interested in our daughter! Uh... No problem, Bob! Oh! Let's play some traditional rainicorn games! Jake, do you know Cameladabalawabapp? [Note the name is pronounced with blowing a small raspberry at the end.] Uh, s-say it again? Cameladabalawabapp! Ohhhh! [Laughs] Cablatapuamba—[Blows raspberry]! I thought you said "Kabloderaga—[Blows raspberry]"! [Chuckles] Ah, man, I love gettin' down and dirty with some Cablatapuamba—[Blows raspberry]! Ha! Y'all should go first, though. Hmm. Bold move letting your opponent move first, Jake. I respect that. Very well. Cameladabalawabapp!! [Fires a beam from his horn at the wall, which turns red.] Oh, Bob! Haha! Your turn, Jake! I... [Entering] Snacks! Get your snacks! [To himself] Finn! [Whispering to him] Dude! I have to show Lady's parents that I have rainbow powers! I need homie help! Hmm... I got a plan, bro-ham. Just stretch your horn at me, and I'll take care of the rest. You're the best, homie. Homies help homies. Haha! [He steps back and Finn breathes in and holds his breath, then gives a thumbs-up.] Cablatapuamba—[Blows raspberry]! Very unusual color palette, Jake. Yes. Subtle. Whoo! Oh, yeah! [Finn is breathing heavily on the floor.] Finn? How about we play some more traditional rainicorn games, my boy? I, uh... Oh. Um... let's do it! Let the games begin! [Whispering to Finn] I'm sorry. [To the parents] Yo, my bad! I'll get 'im! [ [Angry] IT'S "GOING" CRUD-COW! I know, I know, I'm sorry. But they really like me. Your plan is working perfectly! Being poked in the buns and laughed at was not in my plan! Not in the plan! Look, Finn, you know I got yo back fo'-eva', but right now, you're the only one who can help me. Come on, homie. [He smiles at Finn who is still making an angry face.] Homies help homies. [Finn smiles.] [Ethel and Bob enter laughing.] Hey, guys. You ready to get this game goin' again? Oh, no, we're pooped. Yeah, we're about ready to break out our picnic basket and dig in! Wohhh, no. You're my guests. Let me take care of you. [Whispering to Finn] Homie... help me cook something, please. ...Okay. Thanks, Finn. [To Ethel and Bob] Okay. Don't worry about a thing. Finn'll make a great lunch. He's a little raw, but he's got great taste. What?! Wow! So wealthy, and so generous! Ah! I was hoping! [Laughs] I was afraid to ask! WAAAH! Jake!! I think they wanna eat me!! Of course we do! Jake said you'd "make a great lunch"! JAKE! COME ON! [Panicking] Man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.... AAAH! Knock it off, Bob!! [Punches him] [Punching Finn] Don't you touch him!! Come on, stop it, guys! Come on, y'all, I said stop! [Growls angrily then grows huge] NOW, THAT'S ENOUGH!!! Nobody's eating Finn!! He's not my butler, and he's not food! Finn is my friend! [Ethel and Bob gasp.] I'm sorry I let the lies get so far outta hand. I just got so scared of losing Lady! [To himself] But if they hate me, so be it. No more lies. [Retracts to his default form] [Gasps] You're a dog? Yeah, I just... [Groans] Look, I'm sorry about everything. I was— YAAAAAY! HA-HEEEY! HURRAAAAY! Uh... uh... [Gasps] Lady?! 어, 나도 우리 부모님 때문에 걱정했었어! 우리 엄마아빠는 개라면 완전 맛이 가거든! 개가 전쟁터에서 우리 아빠 생명을 구해줬었어! ("Oh, I was worried about my parents! My mom and dad are crazy about dogs! A dog saved my dad in the war!") What did she say? She said she worried that they'd freak out... 'cause her parents are bananas for dogs! J.J. FLIP! What the zip?! Yeah! She says a dog saved her dad in the war! Wow! That's flippin' awesome. Finn. [Stops staring at his food] ...Wha? Listen, I just want you to know how sorry we are about... trying to eat you. It's just we thought we'd never get another chance. We thought humans were extinct. Oh. So... this isn't human? Oh, no. This is soy people! Oh. I've never tasted real human before, but they say you can't even tell the difference! Ew... Soy? [Eats some and smiles] FINN, YOU'RE DELICIOUS! AAAAH! Last chance, Swamp Giant! Tell us where you hid the Mini Queen! NEVER!! Huh? [He finds the Mini Queen.] Hi, Mini Queen! Jake! I've got 'er! Then hold my hand, dude! [Finn does so.] Whoooop! Aaaah! Oof! My inflatable angel. Heh heh heh. [They jump off the giant.] How's the Mini Queen? I dunno. Can't understand a word she says. [The Mini Queen promptly writes a message on [Sniffs] Mini Queen must've stepped in somethin' funky. [Sniffs] No... It's not tiny feet I'm smelling! This way! [He sniffs the ground and follows a scent. The scent leads him to a sword.] Whoa! What? [In awe] Do you know whose sword this is?! This is the sword of Billy! Billy?! [Singing] BIIILLYYYYYY!!! Nothung! Oh, yeah! That was the most mathematical thing ever! Oh, yeah! Hahaha! He fought a bear! This is so cool! Whoa! It's Billy's legendary crack! [Sighs] Hello. [Whispering to Jake] It's him! It's him!! [Whispering] I know, I know! Be cool!! Yep. It's me. Man! I'm such a huge nerd for you! Please take us on as hero apprentices! What for? So that we could learn to kick evil's butt... just like you! I wanna be the dog version of you! Ahh, that'd be a waste of time. Heh. Yeah. I-I'm a little paunchy... but I could do some sit-ups! No, I was talking about beating up monsters. It's as pointless as a dog chasing his own tail. Heh. See, that's where you're wrong... 'cuz watch! [He tries to catch his tail, of course to no avail.] Ah... ah... What do you mean, "pointless?" We just saved the Mini Queen from a monster! You know where she is right now? She's probably being eaten by a different monster. She's probably dead. [Finn gasps.] In my youth, I was much like you. Motivated. Headstrong. Wore a silly, little outfit. Even had a magic dog. [Scared, yet smiling] Heh... I'm gonna pass out... [Falls backward] All my life, I've beaten on evil creatures. [Deep sigh] But new evil keeps popping up. Kicking their butts was a hopeless effort! What other way is there? Nonviolently. Help people by being active in your community. Nonviolently?? [Sighs] I gotta try being nonviolent... the Billy way... Me, too! Billy, I won't let you down! I love you, Billy! I got a secret crush on you, Billy! This is gonna be tough, Jake. I'll have to suppress my every warrior instinct. Relax. It'll be easy not to beat up on monsters and still help people. Help! Help! [Finn and Jake notice his cries.] A monster! [The cobbler runs into Jake's leg. Jake retracts.] Oh! Thank goodness! Heroes! I'm being chased by a horrible Dragon! Please, please help! Oh, uh... Oh... Act quickly! He's almost upon us! [Straightforward] Sorry. We don't beat stuff up anymore. No, but please! [Stammers frantically] [To Jake] Dude. We gotta do something to help him. I could teach 'im how to not be such a spaz. [To cobbler] Hey, Mister. Besides being chased by a monster, what else is wrong? Well... I've been running all day. I guess I'm pretty hungry. Say no more. [Walking away, pulling Finn with him] Come on, Finn. Where're you going?! To make you somethin' to eat! AAAH!! NO!! HELP!! I still feel weird about not fighting off that dragon. Trust me. This is a way better way to help 'im. [Yelling out] Gruel! Get your free gruel! [Walking up to stand] What's this all about? Free gruel, ma'am. I can't beat monster butts, but I can beat your hungry guts. That's for sure! Hahaha! [Eats gruel] I didn't throw up! This gruel is very adequate. [Victoriously] YEAH!!! This is great, Jake! Yeah, we're really helpin' people! Whoa! Look who it is! Dude! You're alive! [Angrily] No thanks to you two!! That dragon chased me for two days!! ...And then I was lost for... uh, three days... and then I... I fell under a spell of a beautiful enchantress for... [Unsure] a week? So that's two, plus three, plus a week— [Deliberate] Dude. Gruel. Oh, thank you! [Eats it] Hahahaha! Hahaha. [His hand suddenly becomes encased in stone.] AAAH! WHAT'S HAPPENING?! Huh? [Holds up glass with potion in it] Oh, that's probably the stone skin potion I added to the recipe. It gives your body the power to grow armor. Wha? Ah... uh?! Dude... how much of that potion did you use? AAAAH!! MY TUMMY IS BREATHING FIRE!!! [To Jake] Geez... I thought people would like that. Why?! Why would anyone want that?! So you can defend against evil monsters! You're supposed to beat up monsters so we don't have to defend ourselves! No, see? I'm helping you nonviolently! Helping?! I can't even move my hands! I'm a cobbler! How'm I supposed to cobble with these useless chunk mitts?! Sooo... the village needs the help of a new cobbler, eh? [Thinking] Hmmmmmm... WHAT?! NO— Alright! We're cobblers! No, you're not!! You're just watching my shop while I go to the dermatologist! [Leaving] And don't try to cobble anything! [To Finn] What does "cobble" mean, anyway? I think it has something to do with shoes... [Entering shop] Excuse me! Can you help me? I need a broken heel fixed. I'm going to a fancy funeral. [Taking shoe and heel] Of course I'll help! There! [Rolling over to lady] Whah! [He puts the shoe on her foot.] Pa-kow!! Ah! Now you can fight off evil if it shows up at the funeral! [To Finn] Did you fix that shoe with a magic nail? Maybe... [The shoe arms axes, an extra blade, and a lasso.] Whoa! Cool! I cannot go to the funeral in these! [Entering shop] Hey, everyone! I'm back from the doctor! [The lady's shoe lace lasso's the cobbler.] WHY?! [The lace forces the cobbler to the ground.] [To Finn and Jake] ...And I'm not supposed to bring a guest. [To Finn and Jake] GET OUT!! Apparently, I suck at being nonviolent. Dude, suckin' at somethin' is the first step towards bein' sorta good at somethin'. You and I are like little baby Billys right now, and we're "sucking" on our first bottle of nonviolent milk! [Frustrated sigh] Totes. I'll stop "pooping" my diaper. Whoa, what?! HELP! I NEED MEDICAL HELP!! Medical help? Hmmmmm... How can we help? I want surgery to make my body hot. Yikes... Yeah. I know I'm already pretty smokin'... but I bought this swimsuit, so I need a swimsuit body. [Whistles] [To Finn] You up for some serious plastic surgery? Aw, yeah! This body's hot! And powerful! [Suddenly, machine parts form on her body like a cyborg.] Huh?! Aw, what?! [Her legs turns into a wheel. She makes pained noises.] Dude, did you use a magic nail again? I've got three left! Ohhhh... [She gains a robotic eye.] What did you do to me?? We transformed you into a cyborg fighter! That's hot, right? No one thinks this look is hot!! [To Lumpy Space Princess] Oh, my laces! You're the most beautiful— [He suddenly gets shot with a laser from her robotic eye.] Huh?! ...Jake...? ....Yeah...? I think us being nonviolent... is hurting people. Man... Billy is gonna be so bummed out... Not if we run away, Finn! We'll have to live in halfway homes and be cannibals! We'll survive! I just wanna sit here and moan. Then I'll moan with ya, buddy. [Moaning] Thaaaanks, buuuddy... [Moaning] Yoooouuu'rrre weeeelcooome... AAAH! AAAH! HELP ME!! Hahaha! Relax! I'm just gonna grind you up!! AAAH! AAAH! [To Finn] Aw, man, this grass-bag again?? [Heroically] HEY, EVIL-DOER! [Weakly] Um... could you keep your evil-doing quiet? Finn is dealing with some heavy stuff over here. It's not evil!! When they get this old, they wanna be ground up!! Hahaha! Right, you old bat?! Help!! Right?!? Oooh!! Aaah!! Huh?? A fist raised in righteous anger?! Oh, no! It's my fist!! I've gotta think of a way to save this old lady without punchin' this guy in the face!! Hmmm... [To Old Lady] Yeah, you wanna get ground up, right?!? [Furiously] WRONG!!!! [He punches and uppercuts the Swamp Giant, saving the Old Lady.] [Quietly, to Jake] I couldn't think of anything... Whooo! [Falls in Finn's and Jake's arms] POOP!! I saved her with violence... What's your huff, son? The greatest hero in the world told me to help people without being violent... and I promised I would do that and not let him down... but I did let 'im down. Stuff and nonsense! You sure helped this old gal out! And you did it with violence! Like a true hero, you were born to punch evil creatures! [Punches Finn] Just like I was born to be an old lady! Don't deny your rowdy nature, paladins! [Starts dancing] And don't take advice from old people! [Continues dancing] Yeah... Yeah...! YEAH!! That old lady has a point! Wait, didn't she say not to take advice from old peo— It's all so clear to me! Back to the cave of Billy!! Cha!! It's us again. And we've got exciting news! Aw, I don't—I don't wanna buy anything. Billy, an old lady told me that I shouldn't listen to you because you're old. Also, that I should do what I was born to do... which is kickin' buns. Don't you see how pointless it is? You know what's probably happening to that old lady right now? She's probably dead! She's right here. [Turns around, revealing her] Hello! We saved 'er, Billy. You saved 'er. I saved 'er, Billy. I saved 'er using violence. And that's not a bad thing, Billy! This old lady is alive because of these! [Holds up fists and leg] And look how happy she is, man! She's elated! Hmm. Perhaps you're right. [Pained groan] It's... it's as if your words are filling a void in my very being... You wanna watch? [He reveals a literal void in his stomach. Finn and Jake gasp. The hole starts filling up with body mass.] Nothung! [The sword comes back once again.] Finn and Jake... truly, you are my heroes. [They laugh excitedly.] Now you're freakin' me out... [Finn, Jake, and the old lady climb on We're his heroes!! Huh... Hello. Ha! Haha! I love you, Billy!! Get outta here!! Good morning, Breakfast Princesses. [He sneakily climbs in through the window. He comes up beside their bed with a jar of honey and a honey dipper. He drips honey on Breakfast Princess's waffles.] Huh? [Ice King looks up at them, mumbling incoherently and then suddenly frowns.] Sis, give me the phone. [Toast Princess hands her a phone from beside their bed. Ice King?! How many times have we warned you about using love potion? That's why I'm using honey. Man, who cares if it's honey? You stink anyways. [laughs] Yeah, you stink so much I'm gonna ground you for a week! What? You can't do that! You're grounded for two weeks! You're grounded for two weeks! [slowly] Three weeks. Oh, snaps! Why? I didn't do anything. Four weeks? [ That just grounded you for four weeks. Oh, dang! [sighs] Okay. [ Oh, nah, I'm just trying to show you how many weeks ya got. Get outta here, bubble-butt! Awesome. [Finn and This is so unfair! They're the ones who should be grounded. Not me! [ Perfect. [reading what he's typing] Dude, you see my masterpiece coming together, right? [ Mine's whack. [ Well, put some meat in there! Huh. What kind of meat is that? That's Meat Man's meat. Do you think it hurts Meat Man when he gives us his meat? I don't know. I can't read his mind. [yells] No! You guys, I— What do you think "grounded" means?! It's wasted, man. Oh, great. Now see what you did to my buddy? So help me, Ice King. Okay, okay. Goll. [ It's alright, buddy. We can make another. [ Sheesh, this Scorcher guy's got some weird ideas about hitting. Hey, there you are! What's that? I already signed that. [ [while dreaming] Punch, punch, punch! [while dreaming] Rainicorn, don't eat 'im. [ Ice wind! Blow! Blow! Blow! [while dreaming] Meat Man. Meat Man, I'm sorry, Meat Man, I didn't mean it, man. [ Finn and Jake, I am just a dream. I was never here...[ Okay, mister, you are really trying my patience. How clear can I be?! All I want you to do is hit them. On the shoulder or something. [ Blastronaut. #1 solution for all Hitman problems. Sheesh, 99.95? That's nuts. [ Sweet! No! Come back, you wussy! [ Freakin' butt! Butt, butt, butt! Hey, Finn, you awake yet? [while lying down] I'm trying. I had a dream about Meat Man. Oh, yeah? I think I'm gonna stop eating Meat Man. [ You're grounded! I know, but shush! Okay, I hired a guy to kill you by accident. What?! I thought he was going to just hit you in the gut and make you spit up your lunch. [Finn and Jake stare at him, wordlessly.] Well, I froze him in ice, but I think he's free now 'cause he's made out of fire. Or he commands fire, maybe? Good job. Good job, the Ice King. Oh, my life! C'mon, man, let's get outta here! Jake, do something. He's getting close! You alive? Uh, I think so. Whew! That was close. Uh, hey, guys? I don't think this ice dome is gonna last long. What do we do? [ Hey, I'll kill you! No, wait a minute, you two. I won't actually kill you. I'm just gonna lower your body temperatures so you seem dead. And after we fool that fool outside, I'll warm you up, good as new. No way, man! [ Yeah, we don't trust you! You'll thank me later. [to the Scorcher] Stop! Time out! You don't need to do this anymore! Look! They're dead! I killed them myself! [ So, uh, looks like, you can go home now. Oh, yes, of course. [He signs the contract.] There. [The Scorcher burns the contract and disappears in a black vapor. He leaves a paper that reads Oh, glad all that's over. [  Jake... you made this? Yeah! And you buried the treasure right here? Uh-huh. Jake! You're awesome! [Jake shrugs. They both begin digging.] So cool... A suitcase?! Oh, man! I found it at the dump and then buried it without lookin' inside. Whoa. Wait a second, man. I know this case. One night, while you were away at Lady's house, I was dancing in the woods... Evil tapes! Evil! Perchance I saw the Ice King doing something suspicious, so I trailed 'im to the dump, where he buried this case in the ground. You're evil, tapes! Full of evil secrets! That's why I'm going to bury you where no one will ever find you... under all these boogers! [Starts playing in boogers] Wee, hahahahaha! Wee, hahahaha! I waited for him to leave... but he played in those boogers for hours. I decided to come back later for the case... but I lost track of it. Whoa! And I found it? Mm-hmm. Heh-heh-heh. Let's have a secret screening! I'll make some fliers for it! There. Now nobody will bother us. Jake! Jake, come on! Okay. You can play this [a tape], right, BMO? Yes, Finn. It goes in my butt! Oh. This is so exciting! Hello, dear diary. Pretty good day so far. Got up bright and early and had a healthy and slimming breakfast, did fourteen minutes of cardio (and then I finally got around to)... [Talking over tape] Dude... what are we watchin'? I think it's the Ice King's diary. ...I mean, I'm not gonna win carpenter of the year or anything, but it's a place to hang up the old toothbrush. Wenk. [Walks up to camera] Gunther? Hey, Gunther. Get-get away from the camera, sweetie. Papa's recording his innermost thoughts. 'Member? I explained this to you? [Penguin rubs its stomach.] Hey, Gunther? [Penguin jumps up and down on bed.] GUNTHER!!! Wenk. [To camera] Well, anyway, as you can see, I'm not wearing my— Wenk. [To camera] I'm not wearing my— Wenk wenk. Sweetie, I raised my voice because you were giving me the silent treatment. You understand? Wenk. I love you. Can we fast-forward? No, man, we might miss something. [Sighs] There must be more to life than this... Wenk. I know. You don't like when I'm contemplative. ...C-contemplative... No, con-temp-la—Let's put on a play! What?!? [Acting as Princess Bubblegum] Oh, Ice King! You're so cool! You take such good care of yourself! I wanna be with you! Wenk. Wenk wenk. [Pulls off pretend-beard] No, Gunther, beard stays on. Wenk. Gunther, I need ya to wear the beard! Wenk! Gunther! Hey, pause it, BMO. There's gotta be some evil secrets in here. I wanna keep watching. Okay... Well, why don't I make us some snacks? So I don't have to watch... this... Can we sit on the floor? I feel so far away from you guys! Wenk. [Cracks knuckles] Now hold still... [Aims for apple, but accidentally freezes the penguin's face] You moved! Hey, what's this? [Retrieves flier and reads it] "Secret tapes"?! I wanna watch! I'll catch ya later, Gunther! [Exits] Wenk! Gunther, no! Gunther... [Another penguin reacts to the name] Dance pa— [The penguin looks away again] GUNTHER! [Penguin turns to Ice King again] Dance party! [This second pengin runs to Ice King, who dances.] Thanks, Gunther. [Chuckles and munches snack] You're Gunther. [Chuckles with Finn] Oh, fine! Who needs you? More dance party for us, right, Gunther? [Slow song plays and There's probably some evil secrets coming up. [Banging is heard on the front door.] Someone wants to see the secret tapes! What? Oh, but I was so clear in my flier! Let's peek through the window and check who it is! Maybe it's just pizza. Right! Wait! Wait! What? You guys are checking too loud! [Whispering] Oh! You're right. [To BMO] More quietly! I am quieter now. Cool. Hey, guys, it's me. Can I come in and watch the secret tapes with you? I brought some gifts! [Looks up] Aah! Okay. If we're quiet long enough, Ice King will think no one's home and go away. Eh... No one's home. Guess I'll go away. [Starts to walk away] [Noticing noise] Huh? Just turn your alarm off! Hmm. That sounds like BMO! [Knocks on door again] My alarm says it's time for Finn's bath. Finn, get naked. [Whispering] No, just hit your snooze button! I cannot self-snooze. It's against my programming. [Whispering] Well, then, tell me how to do it! Press and hold. [Finn and Jake do so.] Then, press the button on top of my head. [They do it. He must know we're watching his tapes. We need to find his secrets faster. Oh, diary! Thank you for listening to me! Fast-forward, BMO. Play, BMO. So there we are. Turtle Princess is frozen and in my little ice wheelbarrow, and there was... magic in the air. We were both feeling it. [Scowls] But before I could leave the library, Finn and Jake show up. You know how Jake is. Stretch this, stretch that, bah! He knocks off my crown and then Finn bonks me on the nose. Still hurts, too. The worst part is Turtle Princess took away my library card! [Sighs] You know, dear diary, I'm starting to worry that all these entries sound exactly the same, and that my life is just me running in place on some... giant hamster wheel. [Sighs tiredly] Fast-forward, BMO. I'm gonna take a nap... No! These tapes are important! We just don't know why yet. BMO, fast-forward to triple speed! Okay. BMO, play normal speed. [Trying to lift weights] Come on, baby... in the pocket... [Huffs, out of breath] I can't do it... Maybe he's talkin' in secret code. Telling evil secrets in secret code... He's brilliant! Well, how do we decode the secrets? [Ejects tape] Why don't we call others for help? BMO, you're brilliant! Well, who do we call? Um... The smartest person we know, Princess Bubblegum! [Blushes] She's brilliant... Hey, Princess Bubblegum. Hey, Finn. Jake and I found a bunch of secret tapes! We were wondering if you'd help us decode them. Codes? [Taking phone] Yeah, they're really stupid, but, y'know... Maybe they're encoded or whateva. Oh, you called the right person. I know a lot about codes. Let's start with— What? [Groaning] Ohh... Hey, Princess. We got disconnected. [On other end, imitating Princess Bubblegum] Hello, Finny. [Giggles] Hey/Uhhh, you sound weird! Must be a bad connection. That's why we were disconnected earlier on the telephone. Ice King is on the phone outside! [Still talking on phone] So... how's the weather in Candy Kingdom? [Still imitating Bubblegum] Oh, the usual. There's ice everywhere and it smells like penguins! The only thing that smells like penguins is you, Ice King!! [Gasps; normal voice] How did you— What're you doing?! I wanna watch secret tapes with you guys. It'll be nice. No, man! But— [To Jake and BMO] He doesn't know that we're watching his tapes. We gotta find these evil secrets before he uses them against us! Oh... Fine. No more nice. NOW YOU GET ICE!! [Flies up and activates his ice magic] Try watching those tapes with FROZEN EYEBALLS! ...AAAAAAAAAaaa [singing] aaaloutte, gentille Alouette, Alouette, je te plumerai. Je te plumerai la tête! Je te plumerai la tête! Alouette, [Flopping lips with fingers] je te plumerai! Huh. I guess you do know all the words. Anyway, start the next video, BMO. We gotta crack the code on the Ice King's evil secret tapes! Brrrr... You guys cold? Yeah, it's kinda chilly in here. [To himself] Agh... What's on those tapes...? I can kinda... make it out... Dang it, BMO, just turn to your right a little.... Ugh!! By the power of ice... I want your cup of cocoa to fall over. [BMO's hot chocolate freezes, rises from the cup, and knocks the cup over.] Yes! Now turn and pick it up... [BMO turns of his own accord.] Yes... Yes... [Gasps as he views himself on BMO's screen] That's... me? [Beat] THEY'RE WATCHING MY SECRET TAPES?! [Goes away from window angrily] And they're cozy. I'll show them. [Makes snowman] This snowman looks pretty good. [Smiles] Pretty darn good! [He puts a face on it and laughs playfully.] Wenk. Could I have five more minutes, please? I think I can break the code, Finn. Really? Yes. I have detected a noticeable pattern in the tears of sadness that fall from the Ice King's eyeballs. [ Whoa... This is so fascinating... The thirteenth letter of the alphabet is "M." If I print the letter "M" every time the Ice King says an "M" word, it looks like this! [Prints paper] Oh, my Glob, Jake... Is this it? Could this be the Ice King's evil secret? [The paper shows ASCII art of a penguin.] [Furiously ripping up paper] WHAT DOES IT MEAN?! Some of you won't survive this. You'll melt or split in half or your head will fall off... but that's fine... because you're made of snow. Only one thing matters today! Getting into that tree house, getting my tapes back, and beating up Finn and Jake! [Beat] Maybe BMO. Yeah, BMO too! Who's with me?! [No response] Hey, why're you guys so quiet? Are you mad? [Snaps] Oh, that's right. You're not alive yet. My bad. Gimme my tapes back. No, man! I know you've got evil secrets on these, and we're gonna find 'em! Snowmen! Attack! [Closing curtain] Crip, Jake! We gotta unravel these evil secrets at warp-crazy! Good morning. You're watching the evening news. There's been an unfortunate event. Let's go talk to some witnesses. [He turns the camera to an imprisoned Wildberry Princess.] Princess, what is your name? Please! Let me go home! [Jokingly] So, Princess "Please-let-me-go-home," what was it like to experience this tragedy? What? [Stammering] I... I don't... uh... um... Yeah, we're on air, honey, so spit it out. I... I don't know what you're talking about. Obviously traumatized and in a state of shock. Let's go ask somebody else something. [Turns camera upside-down] Upside-down Princess, do you think things will change politically because of today's events? You're really frightening me. Well, there ya have it, folks. People are very upset that Gunther tried to eat Weird... [A loud sound is heard] He's sneakin' in through the chimney! Ah... The element of surprise... Ah, jeez, I'm filthy. [Takes off robe] Well, now I'm cleaner, but I'm also nakeder. [Goes to another room and notices a table full of delicious-looking food.] Ohh! Mmm... [Licks lips] Just what I need... [He pulls the table cloth from under the dishes, shattering and spilling everything on the table.] Hehehehe... [Dons red cloth; goes to door and opens it to reveal four waiting snowmen] Come on, come on! Yeeeesh..... [Whispering to a snowman looking in a fruit bowl] They wouldn't be in the fruit bowl! [The snowman has an apple stuck on his face.] Ohhh! Well, look at you with your nose shining so bright! You're so unique! Hehe! I'll name you Red-nose, and make you leader of the pack! [He accidentally knocks the apple off the snowman's face.] Eh... Well, now you look boring. [The snowman makes a devastated face. Now gimme my evil tapes back!! They're supposed to be buried!! In the ground!! [Fires ice blast at Finn and Jake, who dodge it.] Snow goons!! Oh, no! Don't worry, BMO! Finn! There is one more tape! Play it! His evil secret must be on that tape!! [Urging] No, BMO, please don't play it. Hello. My name is Simon Petrikov. I am recording this tape so that people will know my story. Oh, no! Turn it off, BMO, turn it off!! I was studying to be an antiquarian of ancient artifacts. Now, I never believed in the supernatural stuff myself—just had a fascination with superstitions... but everything changed when I came into contact with this item.... The Ice King!! [Interested, they sit down to listen closer. Ice King comes closer as well.] After purchasing this crown from an old dock worker in northern Scandinavia, I brought it home and excitedly showed my fiancée Betty, [Putting crown on] and jokingly put it on my head just for a laugh or something... and that's when it started... The visions... [Whispering] I fought with them... [Raising his voice, frightened] Shouted at them until I realized it wasn't real—it was the crown!! [Taking crown off] I quickly took it off... and saw my fiancée in front of me... [Whispering] looking at me with such contempt. What had I said? What had I done when I wore this crown? All I know is I never saw Betty again. Since then, I see the visions always whether or not I wear the crown. They tell me the secrets... the secrets of the ice and snow... that the power of the crown will save me with its frost. I don't yet know what this means. As you can see, my skin is beginning to turn blue. My body temperature has been lowering at a supernatural rate, to what is now about 30°C. I don't know when it will end... I'm really scared... I know my mind is changing... but I'm already too far gone to know what to do. I want people to know that... if I do things... if I do things that hurt anyone, please... please forgive me. Just watch over me until I can find a way out of this labyrinth in my brain and regain my sanity!! And then maybe Betty, my princess... maybe you will love me again. [Sobbing] Please love me again, Betty!! Drrr-AMA bomb!! Now you know my secret! You know... that I used to wear glasses! [Sobs more] Maybe kidnapping Wildberry Princess will cheer me up. Wait, Ice King. [Dead serious] BMO, eject tape, please. [BMO ejects the tape, sending it flying into the case with the other tapes. What's this? You're giving me... a gift. No... It's... well... These belong to you. But it's not even my birthday! This is so exciting! [Opens case] Video tapes! Heh, you know, I had a bunch of these once, but I threw them away! This is great, Finn! Thank you! It's from me, too. Oh! I have presents for you guys, too! [Goes to get them; Finn and Jake look at each other.] Here. It's a small pine tree. I chopped it down in one foul swoop! And this [a skunk that is either stuffed or dead] is for you! [Taking skunk] Uh... thanks. Oh, isn't this fun?! We're giving each other presents, we're wearing silly clothes, there's snow everywhere... Let's do this every day! Uh... How about once a year? [Laughing] Okay, that sounds good. And so it was decided... that once every year when the weather got chilly, that Finn, Jake, the Ice King, BMO, Princess Bubblegum, Marceline the Vampire Queen, Cinnamon Bun, Peppermint Butler, Phil, a candy cane man, one of the gumdrop girls, Lady Rainicorn, Lumpy Space Princess, that guy, the other guy, a pig, Tree Trunks, a two-headed duck, the old crazy Tart Toter, the punch bowl, a booger, and Gunter... would get together while wearing really big sweaters and watch videos on the floor next to a fire... to celebrate the day when Finn and Jake had a fleeting moment of empathy for the biggest weirdo in Ooo. It was a miracle. Good night. I'm home! [does some stuff and opens a closet full of games] Who's going to have dinner with me tonight? Sorry fellas, i gotta go make some dreams come true. Where are we headed, dream token? Aha, ah Finn again. Ahahahaha! Say Cheese! Cheese! Hoo! Hoo! Ah, ungus! Hello! Huh? Wait! Wait! Who's that? (pause) She's so beautiful! Buttfeathers! Huh! The cosmic owl? Does that mean this dream is important? Is this a prophetic dream? And is this stuff all symbolic or literal? Huh? Sorry, but... What does it all mean, boy? Dang she's gone...wait, what are you asking me? I can't tell you that? Hoo! (in real word) I don't know, Shelby. I think it's too dark in there! AHH! Pull 'im up, pull 'im up! I think I just had a prophetic dream. Cosmic Owl was in it, he was acting all choco-loco. Finn, you gotta go back to sleep! Huh? Cosmic owl dreams are important always! You gotta Go Back and find them again. Yeah but last time I chased a cosmic owl dream I got dumped. Get back in there! It's too important! You don't got time on my class ring, or bets with Shelby, or Stomach fishing! Oop! What? (shushes Finn) (snoring) Alright let's do it! (Finn arrives back in his dream) Hey! Cosmic Owl, you still here? Whoop! (gibberish bear noises) Buttfeathers! (scene changes to Prismo's time room) Love is weird, man! It really does come when you least expect it! Dude, you've been working on that since you got here! Take a break! You haven't even asked me about my banjo lessons. There going great! Dude? Sorry, I just can't stop thinking about her. Ah, you really are in love, huh! Alright, tell me more about her! Where'dya'meet? In a dream. What! Who's? Finn the human. What? Who's that! Oh, wait, I know that guy. Look, I don't think you're put in charge of prophetic dreams so you could meet ladies. "Hoo" cares. I'm in love! Oh, what am I even worried about. How will you ever even find her again? Do you have any idea how many people are dreaming every night? Yes, I do. Dude, it could take you a million years Then it would be worth it! For love! Forgot my sketchbook. (back at his house after doing stuff again, looking at dreams.) Looks like it's gonna be a long night. Ehh. (looking at a dream, he sees the bird woman and reacts) Excuse me, are these weenies? Shrimp puffs, m'azheer. Oh. *sighs* Hi. Oh, is that a weenie? It's a shrimp puff. Oh I love shrimp puffs! Here. This is a dream come true! (laughs) Do I know you? I'm crashing. Oh! I saw you in a dream and I had to see you again, even though just by me being here, events in this dream will come true. (panics as he trips over the ground) (laughs) Oh geez, that poor guy. Whose dream? Hm? Whose dream did you se me in? Um, Finn the Human. Hm. I shouldn't be here. No, you intrigue me! So powerful! Wha? What's happening? You're waking up. Oh no! Can't you go back to sleep? No, once I'm up, I'm up! But I wanna see you again! I'd like that. Okay, I'll bookmark your dream coordinates and come to you tomorrow night! What do I do with the toothpick? I'll take it. (on TV, back at Cosmic Owl's motel.) and so then she's like, "I really like you" and I said "I really like you too" and then she said "I don't wanna hold hands until I'm in love" and I'm like "that's great, I'm all about going slow" and then she's like "what? You don't wanna hold my hand?." Ha ha! Okay, what is going on with that toothpick? Huh? I can get you a new toothpick. No, I don't want a new one! I gotta go! No wait, there's one m— (flies into a dream with the bird woman on a floating piece of ice) Hi. Hi! Are there any appetizers? No, I think it's just ice in this dream. Oh I wish I could dream another place! I have an idea. (flies bird woman to his motel) My apartment. Oh. It's a bit of a mess. I'm not used to having company. No, it's got personality. I know right! Hey, do you like board games? Tell me about this. Oh, I use that for work. It's interesting. Hey, you wanna, spy on people's dreams? Can we? Sure! Hehehe. What's it like to have all this fingertips? I guess I just don't even think of it. But you're not powerful enough to see everyone's dreams, are you? I'm totally that powerful. Even royalty? Like Ice King or something? His dreams are so sad. Like Princess Bubblegum? Oh, surely she has some dream security system in place. Ha ha ha, we can go right now. Is that what this is about? Yes, let's go right now. Ahahaha this feels weird, it seemed like you really wanna go. It's okay to feel manipulated, right? (the two go) (cheering) Oh thank you, thank you! Yay!!! Boooo!!! After all I've done for you? Huh? Something's wrong. Does this dream seem weird to you? Hoo! No. I worked so hard! Ahhhhh! Hey, hey you! Huh? no. What have you done? (flies back to motel) You interfered with a dream! Oh man, a dream I was in! Why did you do it? I just can't really explain. It felt like the right thing to do! You, you ruined everything! We would've been so perfect together. A— who am I kidding, it's over. It doesn't have to be over, we can run away, together! Your dreamin' kid, and it's time to wake up. No! Hoo! (wakes up) Wenk! Gunter? Aw, did baby have a bad dream? Let me get you a bottle. Wenk! Wenk! Huh? What's heatin' him? [Sighs] [Heavy breathing] [Grunting] Raaaah! Raaah! Come on! Get ready, toids! Raaah! I'm mean as a bus, and I'm mad as rocks! Gumball guardians! There's an enemy at the gates! I'm an all-you-can-eat maniac! Whoops! Aw, come on! Ooh, ooh, ooh! Whoopee! Thank you, little candies. Thank you. You warm the wax heart of this poor king of Ooo! Now, I hear you asking, " It's true. I'm that wonderful. Now, Princess Bubblegum — she says she hasn't gone rogue. She says she's not a wild dog thirsty for blood. She says she's not a literal baby masquerading as an adult woman. She says a lot of things. Princess Bubblegum, you don't make sense! This guy's really working on me. Ennnh... Yes, dear? Do you have something to say? Mm-hmm. I'm James' mother, Trehh! Boo. Who isn't mad about their mutant children? What about Sweet P, King of Ooo? You threatened to burn down his mama's orchard. I did. That is true. Sweet P, I was like a cornered animal. "I knew no' what thy doone." I'm sorry, Sweet P. Here. Psst — give me a kiss. Do you hear us, Princess Bubblegum? Do you hear us?! Shhhhhhhhut up. Princess, I'm sorry to disturb you, but I feel that you must campaign. The candy people are real dumb. I'm studying something that could be real important. Dah! This dumb election. It's not even — [yawning] I mean, it's barely even — [yawns] ...barely even legal. A barely and yet fully legal election — that's what my campaign manager told me. Let's hear it for him — Mr. X! [Laughs] Weird, right? And even being legal, I mean, I made everyone. I made their homes. The candy people are mercurial, but they're not dillweeds. And this definitely legal election is in the jam-covered fingers of you, the people — the candies. [Grunts] So, go. Vote with your hearts. Vote with your minds. Vote for the candidate who's not a teenage gum-golem. I mean, they know that I love them. And the votes are in. King of Ooo is our new princess. Hey, hey! What?! Whaaaaat?! You dillweeds! You're a dillweed, you're a dillweed's secretary, and you're probably some dillweed I've never met! You're three dillweeds being dillweeds, and you're going to dillweed this place into the ground! And you — [growls] Princess! Princess! I don't know what a dillweed is. Hey, PB, what's the plan? We pledged our allegiance to you. Your allegiance is to the kingdom. [Sighs] Dudes, I don't know. I don't know when I'll be back in charge — if I'll be back in charge. I need you both to stick around here and make sure the candy people are safe, even if it means working for a wad. Auf wiedersehen, meine champions. Mwah. Mwah. There's a new golden and waxy mornin'. Good times a-comin'. You've got your warning. There's cheap healthcare, the workcamp's there. The general tone is laissez-faire. I'm a princess, I'm a princess. I'm a priiiinceeeess. What's up, Peps? It's stuck. [Grunts] [Strains] Ho, no, no, no, no! It's okay, everyone. It's okay. Close your eyes and repeat your safety mantra — hoodie hoodie hoodup, hoodie hoodie hoodup, hoodie — Princess? Huh? Oh. Sorry, peps. I'm just so used to having my citizens around to protect. This is gonna take some getting used to. Permission to speak freely, ma'am? Granted. This horrible dump does not meet the level of fancy to which I have become accustomed. Noted. Also, FYI — my Uncle Gumbald built this cabin with his bare hands. I spent my summers here when I was younger. Anyway, it'll probably take a really long time for the candy people to realize a bad ruler is worse than a good ruler. Plenty of time to spruce this place up. Whew! Hey, Starchy. What are you doing — sweeping? Oh, uh, yes, sir. Yes, sir. Suh-wee-ee-eepin'. Yeah. Mm. Hey, is it me, or is getting purpler out here? Oh, yeah. I think that's the catalyst comet. Guess it's getting pretty close or whatever. Getting close? Should we evacuate or... What? No, no. It's cool, I think. It's just here to, like, shake things up, you know?It's okay. We've got sort of a — a relationship. C-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-comet?! Oh, Starch? Eht. What?! Oh, good Glob! Shouldn't we try and calm them down? Ehh, not after that whole knock-my-tower-over-onto-the-castle thing. A lot of guys got smooshed. They need to hear it from someone they really trust. King of Ooo! King of Ooo! King of Ooo? King of Ooo? King of Ooo? Wait, are you saying "King of Ooo"? What are you saying? I thought it was "kinkoff goo." Hey. You hear that? Downstairs. King of Ooo? King of Ooo? King of Ooo! What the — It's that guy from before. He's mucking around with PB's ship — added all kinds of engines to it. Hey! Hey, what do you think you're doing? PB don't let nobody touch her stuff — not even me, and I'm cool — least of all you, you sauce-tasting Brian-sniffer — whoa! [Gasps] Whoa, whoa, whoa! Yeeh! Yeeh! Whoa! Uhhh! [Weakly] No mercy, Jake. [Straining] [Chuckles] Aaaaah! Hey, I'm back — [Gasps] What the bing bong ping pong?! Gunther?! What the king Kong sing song?! Whoaaaa — oof! Sayonara, suckers! [Laughs evilly] Uhh... [Grunts] [Grunts] Ugh! Comet! Comet! Comet! Comet! Comet! Comet! Oww! Aaaaah! [Munching] Toronto, I've been princess for four hours, and society has already totally collapsed. Plus, now the sky is falling, I guess. Is this possibly... Somehow my fault? Pbbt! No way! Okay, look. Without your calming presence and selfless leadership, this situation would have been a hundred times worse. History will remember you as Ooo's greatest hero. As always, the voice of reason. Once again, my saintly nature has compelled me, unthinking, to assume the burdens of others. But a true justice demands a true accounting. And truly this is all Bubblegum's fa-aa-aa-ault! Oof! Good glob! What no-o-o-o-o-w? Looking good, Peps. Man, this feels kind of good, right? It's like we're building a whole new kingdom from scratch, only without all my beloved citizens this time... and their dull, pleading chicken eyes. Maybe the King of Ooo could hold down the fort for a little while. I mean, what's the worst that could happen? Anyway, I'm gonna get some fresh air. B.R.B. What the — why's it so purple outsi— Don't ever mess with me again! [Looks at Jake] Who was that? [Still terrified] The Princess of the Fire Kingdom? [Looks out the window, then back at Jake] Dude, I think I have a crush. What do you know about her, Jake? I was trying to help you get over your Princess Bubblegum sad times by hooking you two up. But she's evil, man! You shut your dirty mouth! [Slaps Jake. Dirty? [Checks gums] Oh. No, really man! Her dad said she was evil! Naw, man, I peeped beyond her burning gaze, and noshed hot lunch with her soul. [Walks to the window] She ain't evil. She's passionate. Help me track her down. Hmmm.. C'mon, man, I really like her. Help me out. [Rubs Jake's face] Jake, Jake help me out. Help me out. Jake, Jake, help me. Jake, Jake, help me! Eeeeeeeeehhh, ok. Whoo! Alright! You sure you're not into any other princesses? What about Wildberry Princess? She's small and plump. You could sleep on her like a pillow. Could be nice. Is that bird... smoking? Hey, don't you judge me. It was that fire chick down there that done this to me. Oh. [Gasps] Oh, Jake... look at her. She's innocent. Like the steam off a puppy's nose, searching for ham in the snow. Guy drops one piece of ham in the snow and he never hears the end of it! Snap out of it! She's burning cute little flowers! [Focusing on Flame Princess] Yeah, she is like a cute little flower. Aaahh! [Comes out of the bush] Oh, no, are you ok? [Gasps] I... I was just worried about you. Huh? Look, I'm sorry about what I said before. I don't know what happened, but I just, I had to see you again. And, I don't know.. I don't know anything about you, [Flame Princess glows brighter] but I just, I really like you. You know, you're so... beautiful. [Sees fire beneath him] Whoa! Ah! Ow! Oh, Glob. Am I hurting you? Yes! That's all you've done! [gasps] Are you trying to hurt me?! Is that why you're following me?! I'm not followi-- Well, I guess technically I am following you. [Gasps then runs away] Hey, no wait! [Chases Flame Princess] [Laughs awkwardly] I guess now I'm technically chasing you. [Laughs again] Finn! Hold on! [Turns into a giant and uses his "buns" to put out the fire on the tree] Eaoww.. Toasty buns. [Runs off while carrying Finn as they reach the end of the forest] Where are you? I want to chat it up with you! Oh, we lost her! Whoa. I am ambushing you! [Throws fireball] Aah! Hey, I like your fireballs. Huh? Why do you torment me? I'm not trying to. I just like you. I think I... I think I like-like you. Listen, when I look at you, my brain goes all stupid. And I just wanna hug you, and sit on the couch and play BMO with you. I can't explain why, but, I never felt this way before and I think we should be together. I... [Smiles, blushes and glows brightly] [Smiles, claps, and laughs in excitement] Yeah. Rggh! Enough. You should not toy with the emotions of a fire elemental. Wait wait, I really didn't-- You told me you liked me, and you made my flame grow brighter, but then you put me out, which hurt! [Throws a big fireball at Finn and Jake] You're trying to impede me. That must be your purpose, ...but fire's purpose is to burn, so I'm going to turn this land into my fire kingdom! No! She's headed for Goblin Kingdom! We need to defeat this fiery she-beast! I can't fight her, man. I'm still into her! Finn, what's more important? Your love for that screwball dame, or being a hero and savin' the lives of innocent goblin folks? Rrrrhh.. Being a hero. Alright, c'mon! Let's go build fire-proof suits. [Frantically searching pile of junk] Uh-uh-uh, I gotta' get back to her. Dude, slow down or your fire suit will be junk. [Sees a bag of bread] Ooh. Is bags of old bread fire-proof? [Slightly shoves the bag, showing Neptr.] Jake, you've found [Whispers to Finn] Oh, plops, we forgot about the game. Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh... I missed you, creator. And we missed you, too, but Neptr, right now we need you to-- To count to 100 while you hide? 1, 2,.. 3, 4, 5-- Neptr, will you help us build fire-proof suits? You cannot tell but I am giving a thumbs up. I am finished! I sure hope Flame Princess is okay. Haha, we are as one, creator. Jake, you think Flame Princess is okay? DUUUUDE! I feel like I can touch the heavens! [Whispers] And sock angels! We're coming up on the Goblin Kingdom. There she is. She seems okay. AAAAHH! Wood for sale! Wood on fire for sale! It's really starting to come together. Needs more... fire... hmm. Flame Princess! Listen, you gotta stop burning the Goblin Kingdom, ...but I don't wanna fight you or hurt you, I swear. I've heard this all before. [Shoots fireballs at Finn and Jake but their suits put out the fireballs. They land in front of You... MEANIE! [Throws fireball at Finn. The suit deflects the fireball as the latter bounces. Hitting a goblin's cart.] My cart. I was born in that cart! [Gasp] I'll put it out! [ Ah! Aah! Jake didn't mean that! Oh... [Hovers near the fire.] I need your help Finn! This one's too big! [Kicks fire] Ah! Whyyyy?! No, Jake, stop. You're hurting her! I will solve this, creator. I will extinguish her using our suit! Foam blaster. [ Wha? Locked on target. [ Yes, creator. NOOOO! AH! [Distressed] I'm sorry! That is the last time you hurt me. [Transforms into her giant form] RAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH! My bad, Jake! Turn it off, Neptr! [Gasp] Oh, my... NO! RAAAAAAAAAHH! [A "tear" comes out from No more... No more! [Kneels the suit then rips out of his suit and climbs at its top.] FLAME PRINCESS! I can't fight her, ...but I can't let her destroy the city... I've failed everyone. Not true, creator. You haven't failed Mmm! [Smiles and gets another scoop.] No. Why can't I just like a girl? [ Ow! [Looks angrily at Finn. She notices he's crying.] Huh? [Coughs then faints.] [Touches Finn's tears then jumps back] Oh. [Gasps for air then coughs; he sees Flame Princess by his side.] Wah! Did I... do something... cool while I was knocked out? I understand now. You're a water elemental. What? You're my opposite. You create water. What, cry? No, I j-- Yeah, you cry and cry all the time. N-No. I-I don't usually do that. That's your power. No! N-N-N-NO-NO-NO! [waves his hands while blushing.] Finn, even if we like each other, we're going to hurt each other. No, we don't have to. I can take it... I... I mean, can't we try? You would defy nature for me? Uh... yeah, whatevs. Aaah.. Uh. Bye, Finn. [Departs] Goodbye, lady. FINN! [Stretches up.] Oh my Glob, man. Everyone's dead, man! They're all burned. There's barbecued bods EVERYWHERE! WHAAAAT!?! Hah. I'm just kidding. I saved 'em. Everyone's fine, see? So. How'd everything go with Flame Princess? She hugged me... then left. Whoa! How did it feel? [Turns to the direction Flame Princess took while leaving a trail of fire behind.] It hurt. The Tree of Blight. Every hundred years, it spews evil spores across the land. Then let's burn its butt down to the root rubbin's. [The duo walks forward.] Finn, I can feel a bunch of eyeballs peepin' us from the woods. Huuugs! What the—?! Is this an extra butt?! [Pushes her away.] Quick, Jake! Burn the tree! Huuuugs! [Finn grunts and they begin circling each other] Gonna hug you up, boy! I'm gonna snuggle you to pieces! Dude! The tree's about to 'splode its evil juice all over! No! [Gasps as the ‎Alpha Hug Wolf makes a roaring charge at him. The ‎Alpha Hug Wolf embraces Is he crushin' you, man?! [Lowering his voice slightly] No, he's just... hugging me gently! Oh...! [Turns and talks to tree] When you see the wicker devil in tree afterlife, tell 'im Hey, buddy, you okay? Didn't even tell me its name... Wha..,? [Noticing the tree is burned down] Oh, sweet! Ha-ha-ha! [In unison] Hot to the touch! Hmmmm... Dude, why're you so huggy? I just feel affectionate, I guess. Hugging helps. Hmm... [Feels Finn's forehead] You've got a fever, man. I feel hot. [Holds BMO tighter] Finn, you're hurting me. I think you need a good night's sleep. You feelin' better today? Yeah. I feel like a million clams. Good. Hey, you think we have enough candy litter? [Eats some of it] Litter for lunch! Mmm! Huh? Not again! What's the matter, Cinnamon Bun? Please, Finn. If you're gonna hug me again, don't make it as hard as you hugged me last night. Uh... I didn't hug you last night. Yes, you did! My love handles still hurt! You came into my room around midnight and gave me a squeeze—a really strong one! [Groans in pain] CB says I hugged 'im. Haha. Cinnamon Bun, you got some crazy notions. I tell ya. [Laughs; Cinnamon Bun also starts to laugh. Jake just makes a worried face. Cinnamon Bun exits as his laugh fades. Yeah, buddy, but you were pretty huggy last night... buddy. Wait. You don't think I actually snuck into Cinnamon Bun's room and hugged him, do you? I'm just sayin' you were really clingy. [Eats more litter] [Muffled] But no. Why would I? And don't tell me it's because I have repressed emotional feelings for Cinnamon Bun. No. I have a theory, ...but I don't like it. Your questionable behavior started about an hour or so after you got hugged by that wolf man, right? ...So...? Well, I've been thinkin' that maybe that wolf man wasn't what he seemed. Maybe he was some sort of hug wolf. Yeah, here it is. [Reading book] "Hug wolves—a subset of wolf men which roam the countryside with a fervid hug lust. Every night, hug wolves must go out and hug people to satisfy their insatiable craving for hugs. To become a hug wolf, one must be hugged by an alpha hug wolf on the night of a full moon."! Like last night! Yes. So you must be a beta hug wolf. A lower-level creature. Well, how can I get uncursed? Lemme, um... read the book a little more. Says there's no known cure. Uh... I'm scared, Jake... [Attempts to hug Jake but he slaps him away] No hugs!! I'm sorry! [Grunts] I feel hot! Rrrrr!! What's wrong, BMO? I am terrified of Finn. Hmm. Well, that plant's not gonna protect you. [BMO stops shielding himself in disbelief] You can get this under control, buddy. ARE YOU READY TO OVERCOME THIS THING?? I think so. I said... ARE YOU READY TO OVERCOME THIS THING?? Yeah. I heard you. I said I think so. I'm tryin'a' getcha to shout. Oh. Okay. IS THIS GOOD?!? Never mind. Now. I want you to think about hugging a cactus. How would that feel? Prickly and painful. Good, good, you're doin' great! Cool. So, can I hug the cactus now? No, you can't hug anything. But that poor cactus! It... it... NEEDS ME! [Stands up and knocks bags of peas off body, knocking Jake down. He pants heavily then growls.] Oh, no, the hug lust is already takin' over your brain! [Growling fiercely] I want to hug you, Jake! Close! Finn... say something to reassure me. I'LL HUG YOUR MOM! Jake! We need the silver baseball! Hrrugs!! HUGS FOR BUDDIES! [Howls] Oh, Glob! Oh, my Glob, Jake! Mama! Bring it in, guys! Screamoooo! BMO! Strobe light mode! [BMO activates his strobe lights.] Not cool! Back, beast! Hug wolf, away! Surely this frosted drink will soothe my fevered tempers. [Finn pants heavily and his POV is viewed as he watches [Hugs him] Hug you up, bro! [Grunts and roars as Mr. Cupcake groans] Dracula? AAAAH!! Eeee!! [Roaring] HUUUUGS!! Get away from my daughter, ya hairy teenager! [Mimicking the sound a shotgun makes when one cocks it] Ch-ch... [Mimics a gunshot noise and shoots the teenager's mirror.] Aaah!! Ch-ch. [Fake gunshot noise; repeats a couple of times as Finn runs away] Ch-ch. [Goes towards window] Eh... eh... SHE'LL NEVER MARRY! [Chases Finn away with more gunfire] Finn? Finn? There he is! Huh? Huh? [Princess Bubblegum chases a cat in the background] What... What happened? Jake... what happened to me last night? You hugged... everyone. NO! We're mad, but we're not gonna go down there. People of the Candy Kingdom, all I've ever wanted was to keep you all safe, ...and because I can't undo the hugs I've caused, my sole wish is to be locked up forever in the Candy Dungeon. Why's Finn in the cage, Mama? Isn't hugs nice? Oh, baby... [Hugs him in concern] Candy People, let's make sure that Alpha Hug Wolf pays for what he's done!! Yeah! Yeah, I agree with the last guy! Cinnamon Bun, you watch over Finn! Uuuuuhhhh... Let's go, boys!! Uh... bu-, bububut... No more hugs! No more hugs! No more hugs! Without consent!! Uh... Huh? [Watches full moon appear from behind clouds and gasps] HUUUGS!! [Growls] Finn? [Finn keeps growling as he transforms.] Uh... Cinnamon Bun... let me out... I-I-I-I'm not supposed to. Don't you want a hug? I can't, man! Not even a little one? Uuuuhhh... You want a hug? [Mutters] YES!! HUG ME!!!! [To himself] C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon... [Unlocking door] Which way does this turn?!? [Finn lunges out with a roar and tackles SAY NO TO HUGS! I smell someone bein' hugged right now! [Spots ‎Alpha Hug Wolf hugging an antelope.] Uh... I have a wife. That hug be your last, demon! Rrr...still love you! [Attempts to embrace Jake's arms but misses] Raaah! Come here, baby! No huggies! [‎Alpha Hug Wolf lands in front of I'm gonna hug you up. You call that a hug? This is the biggest hug that's ever existed! Uuuugghhh... Huh? [Finn notices that the ‎Beautiful Lady is also back to normal; she lets out tired groans] You... You stopped hugging me. Yeah... You stopped, too. I just... didn't feel like I needed any more hugs. Me neither. The curse is broken! [Runs up to her] Can I get a hug? [disgusted] JAKE!!!!! AAAH—! When we catch that bandit, I'm gonna be like Then I'm gonna give him just a wicked noogie, then a lecture on personal responsibility. Then another noogie, like, "Get that knowledge in there. Yeah, dude, but it's getting pretty late. We might got to catch him tomorrow. Aww. What do you think, No looking. [Finn close the eyes and take the sword, Finn Sword shake your head] I bet you can't do that behind your back. Like this? [ What a sword trick.  Oh, oh! I bet you can't do that and freestyle some bars. I can do that! Hyup! [ [Off-screen] Okay, Gunter! You ready for the show to begin?! Wenk! [Sips drink] One, two, three... [He comes out, revealing he's wearing a Marceline wig.] [Singing] Gunter! [Sings the Gunter version of the Fry song] [Gunter stares lovingly at Jay T. Doggzone always says, "Ladies are drawn to bros with tortured pasts." And I've got a way tortured past! ...I think. I don't really... re... [Unsure] Hmm. [Flies up and grabs the penguin] Quickly, Gunter! To the "The Past" room! Lot of emotional, powerful stuff in here. [Sniffs it] Still wet with tears... I'll take some-a' these for lyrical inspiration. [Throws scrapbook on pile of junk] So where's Marceline living these days? Wenk. A cave?? [Blows a small raspberry] [Viewing Ice King] Well, well, well. Looks like the Ice King is up to bad biscuits, brotha. Bad biscuits make the baker broke, bro. Ice King, you make our job too easy. You ready to roll on this fool? Dinner roll! Hello? Anybody home? [To herself] No... [She goes outside her house.] What are you doing here? I told you not to come around me! [Laughs] Uh, yeah, I know, but... I was hoping you could help me write a song—one that could help me get some princess action. I'm not gonna help you pick up on chicks! [Desperate] Come on! We could be a prog rock duo! I'll even split the fans with you. I get the princesses, and you get... whatever it is you're into. Sounds good, yeah, I think it does! [Beat; Marceline is scowling.] Ee-yoop! [Landing on porch; to Ice King] Hey!! Eh... Get outta here!! Wait! Just let me play you what I've written so far! [He unties his equipment and it falls to the ground.] [To himself] Oh. Dang it. Tangles in the cord. Sometimes this happens when you fly with it... Tangles are hard... [He grunts as he tries to untangle it. Marceline just stares.] Oh. Aw, aw, geez, no... Oh, no. [He lays on the ground, trapped in the tangled cord.] Ice King! ...Wha? Oh... You got 'im. Nice job, Marceline. [Talking like Batman] Your constant harassment of the female gender makes me sick. No, he can stay. Wha?! Yeah, "Wha?!" It's alright. We're working on a song together. [She takes Ice King.] You don't want us to... [Connects palm with fist] ...for you? No, it's okay. You guys can go. ...Okay... Well... I guess we'll see ya, then... Bye... [They exit.] [To Marceline] You know, I kinda like bein' tied up in these cords. Kinda freak-aaaayyy! So what kinda song're we playing? Ooh. I brought these [the scrapbook pages] for some inspiration. Just use these to work off of. Y'know, a template. Oookaaaay... Yeah. Yeah, that's good! Keep doin' that! [ Stop acting like this!! No, it's just startin' to get good!! [Shooting ice beams everywhere, singing] Anybody!! [Speaking] Princesses, I command you, love me!! Love me!! Love me!! [Crying] Love me!! [Direct] STOP ACTING CRAZY. I JUST WANNA BE LOVED!! [Pushes her off forcefully] Uh-oh. I'm sorry I pushed you. [He goes to the kitchen and plants his head against the refrigerator in sadness.] Uh... oh... I'll just stay out of your way. [Climbs on refrigerator] Again, I'm sorry I pushed you. Huh? Whatcha got? An apple? [Frustrated] Ugh! [She drops the apple and just drops down, sitting in front of the fridge. She rolls the apple away; the apple reaches the Omnichord and turns it on.] [Singing] You're so annoying, you pitiful old man. I'd like to help you, but I don't know if I can. I thought you were nuts, but you're really really really nuts. [Beat] Every time I move, eventually, you find me, and start hanging around. Just another lame excuse to see me. Man. It's getting me down. You know, I'm actually glad... to see you! [Speaking] Maybe I'm the one who's... [Sighing] nuts. Hold on! [Drops from fridge] Do you... like me?! ...Of course I do, you old jerk! Really? ...Wow. [Wipes dirt off sleeve] How about... [Spreading arms out] one of these? [Marceline's scowl fades. She consents and hugs him, visibly bittersweet about it.] Ah! [They pull back and look at each other in the eyes. He puckers his lips.] Mwah, mwah, mwah... [Disgusted] AAAAAGH!!! Not like that!! You don't remember anything, do you... SIMON? What-mon? Why do you even come see me when you don't remember me?! You don't even know who you are! Yes, I do! I am a lyricist! [Pulling pages out] It's all here! On the page! The page in song, baby! On this receipt! On this takeout menu! On these newspapers! [Laughs] Huh? Look! This clipping! This was you, Simon! Before the War! Huh? [He can't make heads or tails of it.] Heh? This! You took this picture! Grr, you've scribbled all over it... Huh? [She reads the back of the photo, visibly in great shock.] Ooh, ooh, are they good lyrics? [Grabbing Omnichord] I'll get the keyboard! What? [In desperation] Wait, listen! [Sets Omnichord up] Yeah, let's go! What's it say? Sing out, sister! [Singing and reading note] " Ooh, yeah! Keep it going! [Goes to drumset] [Looking for another photo] Oh! Um... [Singing and reading note] "This magic keeps me alive, but it's making me [Pulling hair back, stressed out] crazy, and I need to save you, but who's going to save me? Please forgive me for whatever I do [ [Happy] Wow! I wrote that?! Hot stuff! What?! You don't remember what it means?! [She grabs another photo and shows it to him. She tears up as her voice breaks.] Look! [Reads note while singing] "Marceline, I can feel myself slipping away. I can't remember what it made me say... but I remember that I saw you frown. I swear, it wasn't me. It was the crown. [He frowns and looks confused, but then ignores it.] This magic keeps me—" [Singing together] "—alive, but it's making me crazy, [Marceline begins shedding tears.] and I want to save you, but who's going to save me?! Please forgive me for..." What is goin' on in there?! [Takes binoculars off] ...I have no idea. [Singing together] "...Please forgive me for whatever I do... when I don't remember you." Ready? Yes [Sounds of concentration] [Then farts] [Seals Squeez-E-Mart bag like a balloon.] [Shoots the balloon with her fire] [Balloon explodes] That was awesome! Alright, alright, my turn. [Lies on Jake's back] [Sounds of concentration] [Then burps] [Seals Squeez-E-Mart bag like a balloon.] [Focuses on balloon and shoots the balloon] [Balloon explodes] [Laughter] [Laughter] You guys are full of magic air. [Gasps] [Farts] [Disgusted] Gross! [Rolls with Jake] [Then slaps Jake] No! [Turns to Flame Princess] Princess? You, okay? [Looks downed] Yeah... It's just the air smells bad from your magic tricks, and now I feel sad. [Looks at Finn and Jake] I left all my scented candles at the castle. They'd really cut through the magic stink. Just go back to the Fire Kingdom and get 'em. Problem solved. [Sighs] [Then stands up] Then I'll have to see my dad. I'm still mad at him for imprisoning me in that lantern. So UNFAIR! [ [Frightened] Uh, we can go get 'em. [Returns to her normal form.] [Pleasant voice] Really? That would be really nice. [Warns] But don't let my Pops see you. I don't want "His Majesty" thinking I need anything from him. [Farts] [Surprised] That ain't me. [Looks at the rock] Whoa! [inside the rock] [Farts more] [Approaches the rock] [Opens the rock] Oh! [Farts again] [Relieved] Flambo! [Whispers to Finn] For a second, I thought the princess was farting. Flambo, we need you to cast Flame Shield on us. [Agrees to Finn] Alright! [Rubs both of his hands] [ [Stretches his left arm to hold onto something with Finn holding onto his back, sneaking pass the Flame Guards.] [Tip toe walking towards near the scented candles.] These candles, must be "They." [Sniffing the candles] [Whispers] They smell like an old lady's bathroom. [Whispers with anger] Hey! Don't disrespect my lady! [Whispers in reply] I said that as a compliment. Like, it reminds me of grandma. I love my grandma. [Takes the candles and puts them into his backpack.] No one comes-sss here. Not since Flame Princess [Finn jumps and lies close to the bottom of the door.] leaved [for left] the castle. Now guesssss what we're gonna kill Flame King with? [Gasps] [Then whispers] A conspirator with a hiss voice! How about, water? Even worsssse, we'll use icccce. [Whispers] And a conspirator with an untied shoe. Ice? Why ice? Cuz it'sss more painful, You sssimpleton! Cold as iccce fallzz. A perfect death for the Flame King. [Evil laughter] [Gasps, turns around, and Jake is thrown away.] Whoa! Did you hear that? [Sniffs] Jake, come on! We gotta stop those guys from killing Flame Princess's dad! [Drops the candle] Right, right. [Opens the door] Dirt bags! Where'd they go? [Tip toe walking] [Gasps] [Plans via body language] [Then disguises themselves as a painting] [Walking backwards] [Notices] Hey, is that new? Yeah, I think it is. Yes it is new. Hm, what you guys think about this painting? I like it. Hey, is this one of those paintings where the eyes follow you. [Looks at the painting] [Concentrating] [Moves to the right and left while looking at them.] [Still concentrating] Hmmm [Sighs] [Moves to the right] [Gets bored] Come on, let's get out of here, I don't wanna miss snack time. SNACKS! And SNACKS! SNACKS! SNACKS! [Walking backwards] SNACKS! SNACKS! SNACKS! [Losing concentrating] [Breaths] Now what? And most of actual murdersss... [Whispers] You hear that? It sounds like a voice with a hiss. The kind we are looking for. The ssserpent that isss... Stop! ...my father's life, now wears his crown. [Hisses] [Looks above] Dude, the voice We must follow the voice [Opens the air vent] [Uses his stretchy powers to get there and pulls Finn up.] [Then closes the air vent] To die, to sleep; To sleep perchance to dream... [Whispers] Which way is the hiss voice coming from? ...there's the rub; For in that sleep of death what... [Whispers] This way! ...dreams may come. [Drags self] [Whispers] Which way? I seem to be saying a lot about our [Jake raises his left ear] super secret plan [Whispers] To the left You! [Checking out] [Pointing with their right finger at each other] You! You! You! [Pointing with both fingers at each other] Double you! Double you! [Whispers] I don't think it's them. Double you! Double you! [Falls] Whooaaa. [Whispers for checking] Jake! [Whispers in response] I'm okay. I think I hear that hissing voice down this way! [Falls down toward Jake] Whooooo! [Falls flat on his face.] [Questions with disappointment] Why didn't you catch me? Whoops. Tell me next time, I can't think in the future. [Whispers] Vent ahead.[And looks outside] [Whispers] Jake, I wanna see. [Jake steps aside] [Eating cake] [Then measures cake] Thirty-seven... [Eats another and measures again] Twenty-two [Whispers] No hissing. [Whispers] No untied shoe. [whispers] Vent [Hisses] This need something more, yes... [Hisses] ...yes, that's the... [Hisses] ...stuff. [Whispers] Whoa, it's him! [Dives quietly] Hmmm? [Shows up] My blueb'ies! [Hisses] [Points right finger to Jalapeño pepper] You baffoon! Where's your partner with the untied shoe? What partner? What are you blueberries...? [Hisses] ...talking about? [Rises fist) Give it up man! [Then points right finger to Jalapeño pepper] I heard your hiss voice! I don't have a hiss... [Hisses] ...voice. [Then points right finger to Finn] There's a.... [Hisses] ....snake on your shoulder. What? [Hisses] [Frightened] [Slaps the snake away from him and landed on Jake.] [Looks at the snake] Hmmmm. [Hisses] Sufferin'... [Hisses] ...succotash. Now to chop you two big blueberries into small bite-sized blueberries. [Then chases after them] [Screaming and running for their lives] [Chattering] Five minutes are closing everyone, five minutes. [Takes two members of the theater troupe to a room.] I'm sorry, I'm sorry. [Picks up a table with food on it] [Runs with disguises on] [Panting] [Then heads to a room] Oh. Psh, actors. [Lays a hand on a theater troupe member] What's going with the costumes? [High voice] This is a theater troupe. We're getting rrready to perform for the king. Everyone in the kingdom shall be in attendance. [Lowered voice] Of course, you know all this being fellow actors from the exact same troupe. [Turns around and picks clothes] [Makes a distance with Finn] I have an idea. We'll go on stage, act like two conspirators, you will have one shoe untied, I'll talk with a hiss voice, we'll talk about how we want to kill the king, as we do these, we'll study the faces of the audience, a move of guilty reactions. [Likes it] That's brilliant! Thanks! It's an original idea, by me. [Cheering] [Clears throat] Hey conspirator! Hey co-conspirator! Let's talk about how we're gonna kill the king. Shhhhhh sssssomebody might here our evil plot. [Not liking it] Man, I am so lost. Psst, the audience. [Moaning] [Then sneezes] You think that's one of them. Maybe, let's keep goin'. So, what are you packin'? Water, man. Enough of it to put out the King's fire. [Still moaning] [Then eats a hot dog] [Looking around with suspicion] I thinks he's starting to crack. Water? You know what is more painful, if we pour ice in his ear. That's how we'll kill the Flame King. [Bored] Psh, kill the [Approaching Finn and Jake] What!? No! [Pinning Finn and Jake to the ground] [Grunts] Please, we were trying to warn you about the assassins! Hmmmmm, search them! Hmmmm, [Surprised] Huh? [Sniffs the candles] Sire! It's your daughter's scented candles. Ahh... ahh, ah. Sickos! [Orders] Off with their heads! Whoa, what!? [Cheering and chattering] Yes! Sssstay sssstill. Sssstill? [Evil laughter] Untied shoelace? [Gasps] It's them! Sssso long, ssssuckers! NAKED BABIES! NAKED BABIES! NAKED BABIES! [Surprised] NAKED BABIES! NAKED BABIES! NAKED BABIES! [Gasps and shocked] NAKED BABIES! NAKED BABIES! NAKED BABIES! [Clears throat] We found 'em! The executioners are the real king killers! [Disbelief] Ssssilence! Wa-wa-wait, wait. That voice. [Orders] Guards, take off their hoods. Here, my identity! [Hisses] [Guilty] Argh [Surprised] Furnius and Torcho! Hello Uuuncle! [Shocked and surprised] Wait, what!? [Orders] Arrest the executioners! [Arrests the executioners] Hmmmm, [Points right finger at Furnius and Torcho] I thought I had you two extinguished. You cannot quench the flamessss of revenge! You snucked on our father to become king! Oh, yeah! Hehe. [Orders] Take them to the punishment room! [Takes Furnius and Torcho to the punishment room.] I'll dessstroy all of you, with ice! Release me! Wait! So, you? You extinguished their dad? [Yes tone] And everyone is evil here? [Performs a stunt towards the stage] [Yes tone] All evil. Then, is Flame Princess evil or maybe chaotic neutral? She's evil. Okay, so your daughter's evil. We've established that, but do you think if a good guy really liked her, could he, change her to good? Hmmmmm, well, there'd be penalties to her experience, if she acted out of alignment. But, yes, someone could change her. [Smiles happily] [Leaves the stage] [Thinks about his daughter] Change her to good? [Worried] Aww... [Breathing] [Picks the scented candles and lights them with Flame Princess's hair] [Then puts them on her bedside table] [Looks around] Evil, evil, evil, evil, evil.... EVIL!!! [Wakes up] Aah! Aah! [Turns around right after what she saw] You gonna do the thing again?! Yeah, man! Whaaaat? Nice. Hey, Princess Bubblegum. Hey, everybody. [Panting] Man... [Panting] Dancin' is rough! Yeah... I'm havin' some sweat issues here! I'll go get us some snackety-juice. Hey, man. I'm Check it out, Jake! I got us some peanuts. And punch! [Throws a punch while saying "punch"] [Spits out his peanuts] Choking!! Don't give up on me, man! Whoa, Finn, nice book. [Casually] Yeah. 'S pretty cool. It's the Enchiridion—the hero's handbook. [To the bear] Hey, guy, you alright? [The bear softly growls.] Haha. He's all good! Everybody get back to your dancin'! Uh, Finn? I think that bear is followin' us home. Whoa. Haha. I think you're right. Hey, bear, you gonna come hang out with us? [The bear comes nearer.] Whaddaya say, bear? [The bear eats a leaf on his fur.] Heh-heh. Awesome. I dunno, Finn. This guy seems kinda weird. Yeah. He's totally weird. Hahaha! [The bear attempts to imitate [Unsure] Mmmmm... Jake! Hey, Jake! [Jake takes off one side of his headphones] Jake! Jake Come here! Ya gotta check this out! Eh, okay. Check this out, man. This bear is tops blooby! [Jake rolls his eyes and sighs] Watch this. [ [Laughs] Oh, stop! [Finn pulls Haha, come on, Jake, try it! It's awesome! Heh-heh. Um... Yeah, okay. [Grabs a broom and starts sweeping] Sweepy-sweepy-sweepy. Sweep sweep sweep. Sweepin'! [Laughing] He's got me down pat! Heh-hah! Sweeping's weak. [Annoyed] Mmmmmm... Sweeping weak. Whoa! This guy's alright! This guy just busted me up my chops, Finn! Hey, come on, he's just a bear. He don't know nothin'. Mmmm... Yeah, I guess. Well, anyway, it's gettin' pretty late. Probably time for everyone to go back home to their own houses. Yeah, I guess you're right, Jake. It is pretty late. He should probably stay here tonight. [Jake scowls.] [To bear] You can sleep in the bathtub! Braaaathtub. [Laughs] Brathtub, hahaha! This guy's tops blooby! [Claps once] Whaaaat? Hey, Princess Bubblegum. Hey, everybody. [Snaps some more and claps once] Whaaaat? Hey! [Snapping] Hey, Princess Bubblegum! Hey, everybody! [Jake slowly backs away and falls down.] Whaaaat? Hey! What are you doing?! Shhh. Come with me. Ya gotta see somethin'. This bear's wiggy, Finn. It's wearing your clothes and dancin' around all crazy. That sounds rad, man. What?! No—Just—! ... Rrrr! [Pulls Finn out of bed] Aw, man! [Finn sighs.] Oh, ya gotta believe me, Finn. I swear, he was, like, all wigged-out, was dancin'... [Desperate noise] ...I do believe you. [Pleasantly surprised] Oh. It's just, y'know, who cares? Dancing, wearing clothes... He ain't hurtin' nobody. He's just doin' it up, y'know? He's just cool, and he likes my style. That ain't a crime. No. [Chuckles] I guess not. Okay. Great. I'm going back to bed. You comin', smart guy? Yeah, okay. [Chuckles] You're not even a little weirded out by this? [In near unison; Finn is ahead of the bear by a few words] No, man. He's just doin' his instincts. He's like a parrot or chameleon or something. He's funny! Anyway, I gotta go pick up BMO from soccer. I'll be back soon. And remember don't eat my special Yeah, I get it. You don't need to tell me that every time you make Finn Cakes. Hey, what are you doin'?! [The bear begins eating the cakes.] Why, you little...! Tryin' to set me up, eh? You think you're so smart, but this time, I'm ready. [Pulls out video camera, records bear, and laughs] OH, MY GLOB, WHAT?!?! JAKE! YOU ATE ALL MY FINN CAKES! WHAT THE STINK! Uh, nope. The bear did it, and I've got proof. I taped the whole thing. [His face turns very red with rage] The bear ate all my cakes, and you just sat there and watched him do it?! What's wrong with you?! Ju— What?! No, man, he was tryin' to frame me, Finn! He's tryin' to steal your identity! Why can't you grok that?! [Exasperated noise] He's a bear, Jake! He's a wild animal! He doesn't know things! He just does stuff! He's cool! Ohh, fine, then that's just great. Then you and M.C. Cool Friend can go stink it up together at your stupid cool Finn party all by yourself, cause I'm not going! ...Wait. What? What party? What? Your party, man. Tonight? In the woods? [Reading flyer] " Huh?! Well, who did, then?! [Finn gasps.] [In unison] The bear. ...I knew it. See, dude? He's not just jackin' your style. He's jackin' your whole you! Jackin' yo you up! What the what? He got in close and used you. Now he's feedin' nuts to your ex-girlfriend! [To bear] Sure! I'll have another... [The bear cuts her off by feeding her a peanut] [Muffled] ...peanut. She's not my... [Thinks for a moment] We never went steady. He's trying to replace you, and he's already got everyone convinced he's you! He didn't really like you. [Whispering] He used you. Troops brooby! Troops brooby. Troops— [Finn pulls the bear's mask off] Not cool, man. [Everyone stops dancing.] You're not me. You're just a bear acting like me. [The bear starts crying and quickly leaves.] [To everyone else] It's okay, everyone. The imposter is gone. [Saddened] Wait... what? We just thought it was one of your jokey-joke-jokes. [Makes an angry look at Finn and he briefly does the same] Hey! Hey, bear! Wait up, guy! Hey. I... I didn't mean to make you feel so bad about yourself. I'm really sorry about that. Me, too. But... you're a super-rad bear, so... why not just be you? [Crying] I... want... be... hero... like... yooouuuu! [With pity] Awww... I guess he's got a heart of gold after all. Hold on, bear. I got something for ya. It's the Enchiridion, the hero's handbook. Everything you need to know about being a hero is in this book. Take it, and learn. [Whispering] Finn, are you nuts?! We can't give that book away! It's, like, crazy-important! Whatever, man. We never use it, except for, like, sitting on it when the grass is wet and stuff. [To bear] Drink your fill of knowledge. Someday, you'll be a great hero. Thank you, Finn. Thank... yooouuu... Did you bring the book? Yessss... One step closer. And so, through my experiments with cloud-seeding, I've invented... liquid pyrotechnics. That's really cool, PB! Aw, thanks, puppy. [Draws Jake onto her lap.] Isn't it cool, Finn? [Stammering] Owwww-guh... [Giggles] Uh, Finn. No. Come on, Finn, don't be weird. Look, I'll see you guys later. Huh? Oh. [ It's letting up. Hey, Finn, come on, let's go do something. [Sighing] [Whispers] BMO, put on a game. [Sighs dejectedly] Oh, Finn.... Uncle Finn, I'm going out for a quick.... walk in the woods. [Makes a pained noise] BMO, you look after him with your camera-eyes. If anyone tries to hurt Finn, I will kill them. Ok, good. [Screams] Woman! I'll save you, wash tub princess! [Still screaming] You're safe now, Miss... Flambo?! Yeah, it's me. [chuckles] Bet you thought I was dame on account of my girlish screamin'. I did think that. [Throws the wash tub] Haha, well. Thanks, anyway, brother. Hey.... You're pretty plugged-in, Flambo. Do you know any princesses Finn's age? Oh, yeah. I know just the skirt, ...and she's way hot! She's from Fire Kingdom? I think I'll die if I go in there. Heh, oh yeah. Ow... There, I cast Flame Shield on yous. Also I spat on yous. [Angered grunt] BMO-cam on. Gold-darn you, tear ducts! Yah! Yah! [punches himself in the eyes.] Ugh... Hang in there, buddy. [Gasps] [ [Whispers] Dude, you gotta pretend like you're of royal blood. Could have told me this sooner. Haha! Yeah. Good morrow, Majesty! [Exclaims] I am Sir Hmmmmm.... What do you seek? Speak! [Points left hand at Jake.] [Terrified] Uhk-uhg... I come as an envoy of Prince Finn. A prince?! [Chattering] A prince! Finn is a prince! Yeah, a prince! Yeah and he's the same age as your daughter. [Points left hand at Flame Princess.] Oooh... Bold words, but know you that my daughter is a rare jewel. She cannot be wooed by just any ragamuffin prince! Umm.... Oh, Prince Finn is AWESOME! [Chattering] An awesome prince?! That's the best kind! Silence, my molten mommas. [Walks closer to Jake] We are perplexed. If you are a baron true, where is your gift? 'Tis common practice among visiting dignitaries. [Chattering] Yeah, a gift! Where is the gift?! [Whispers] You're blowin' it, bromite. [Smiles] A gift?! Sire, Prince Finn sent, uh... three gifts! [Shows to hands how many gifts he brought and claps.] [Surprised] What?! Hmmmm.... Three is more than one. [Chattering] Wait a second, three's a lot of gifts! I want three gifts! [Interested] Oooh... The first gift is [looks inside the backpack] um-um-um this water bottle. [Dances like an idiot.] [Groans] [Gasps and scowls] Prince Finn has smoked my jester! Pourquoi?! ("Why?!") ...I do hate my jester. Uh, Prince Finn hated him too. Hmmm... For your second gift, a, uh... hmmmm oh! [Applauds and sighs with admiration] A fire inside my body?! I am disgusted! Give me your third terrible gift and be on your way! [ [Lets out crying huffs] BMO, go away! [Turns around] [ [Yelps] Is that him? He looks terrible! Why isn't he here? Why did he send his buffoon?! Leave now, buffoon, for you have failed! No, wait! Uh-um, [Exclaims] Prince Finn is here! [Stretches his stomach to look like Finn.] He's riiight... here! Greetings, Flame King! My final gift is your favorite thing in the world. A koala bear? Uh, yes! [Sounds of concentration] Eucalyptus! Eucalyptus! I don't like koalas anymore. Begone! [Begins to cry] Dude, don't cry. Can't help it! I'm in love with Bubblegum! She's too old for you. [Grabs Jake with both hands on both of Jake's shoulders] I don't care! Come on! Flame Princess seems into you. No, no, no! Only Bubblegum! Ouw, Finn! [Fake Finn strangles Ahh-ahh! [Choking] Fiiiinn. [Then plays dead and inhales] Excellent! Huh?! You have indeed proven yourself! Any prince ruthless enough to kill his own buffoon would make an excellent boyfriend... [Whispers] Yeah! ... for my evil daughter! Whaaaat?! She's an unstoppable force of destruction. Ahhhh, nothing a psycho like you can't handle. Congratulations! I'm so happy! I'm so happy to meet you, Prince. You're my Prince. [ [Chattering] That's sweet. That's so sweet. [Whispers] She seems normal. [Chattering] Yeah, she seems normal. Stop whispering! [ Hey, so that's where I came from. You know, on second thought, ...we're not really each other's types. We're... what? I changed my mind. I don't like you. [Terrified] Uh, nothing. [Jake uses Fake Finn to pick himself up] Bye, Flambo. [Runs for his life] [Panting] Finn! I really messed up. Finn, buddy, you gotta help me. I made a mistake. [Screaming] Who lit that fire?! I'll kill you! [Kicks the window, shattering it] Yaaah! [ [To himself] Bubblegum's rockets! [Yelling at Flame Princess] Don't you touch her stuff!!! [Screams of pain] It's a girl. You! What's wrong with me, huh?! You don't like me?! [Contrary tone] I like you! What's wrong with you?! Don't ever mess with me again! [Looks at Jake] Who was that? [Still terrified] The Princess of the Fire Kingdom? [Looks out the window, then back at Jake] Dude, I think I have a crush. [singing Prismo's Ritual] ♪Fallen ally, fallen ally, home now in the sky. Fallen ally, fallen ally, a single tear we cry.♪ ♪A truer friend, there was none.♪ ♪ And Prismo was his name.♪ ♪An artisan of pickling, and now just one remains.♪ ♪And now just one♪— [crying noises] I can't do this, man! I-it just can't be over! Hey... We can put it back in the fridge, if you want. No, these picks were made by our friend to be mouth-loved! We have to honor his memory with a final taste of his genius. [picks up pickle jar] Get ready for the dream ritual. [screaming] Prismo we love you forever in our dreams! [screaming, getting progressively louder] Pickle rama, pickle rama, pickle rama, PICKLE RAMA! Finale! Whoof! What was that? Quick, to bed! This has to be the last thing we think about! Hyup! [jumps into bed] Okay... dream! [closes eyes] [mumbles] Aughhh! [ You up already? What the... [grunting] Whup! Oof. [crying] I love you, Everything Burrito. Jake, why are you pretending to dig up Everything Burrito? Huh, what? Hold on, I'm coming down. Jake, you gotta hear my dream, I—Jake? [re-enacting teaching the Dancing Bug to dance] Hey, man, you're shaking it all wrong! What the jump? [points at ground] Shh. Let me show you how.. it's... done! Jake, are you sleepwalking? No, I'm showing this— Whoaaaa! [ Wake! [slaps himself] Up! [slaps himself again] Tunk... I'm not dreaming! [appears in Tree Fort doorway] You made an oath. Okay. Nah, I'll just stretch into a tree. [running towards Jake] Jake! I saw you explode. Something messed up is haps, bruh. Pshhh. Please, not even. [folds arms] No, man, you blew into chunks over there! [ Uh, because Kee-Oth was right there! A-and there were traps! I didn't have no blood this whole time, so I'm totally out of it. Uuuuuhhh... [faints] Jake, this already happened. C'mon, man, stop freakin' me out [kicks Jake, who then explodes into dust again] [coughing] Ugh, Jake dust! [distantly] ♪ Bacon pancakes, makin' bacon pancakes ♪ [while Finn climbs up behind him] ♪ Bacon pancakes, makin' bacon pancakes ♪ ♪ Take some bacon and I'll put it in a pancake ♪ ♪ Bacon pancakes, that's what it's gonna make ♪ ♪ Bacon pancaaake! ♪ Dude, what is the deal? [zooming in on him] Dude, what is the deal? [appearing from the right] Huh hmm huh hmm huh hmm. I can't wait to get this batch of pickles to Jake. He's totes gonna bust a pipe when he gets hit with the cumin and the undertones of sage that come in later. [disappears] [exasperated] Prismo, I'm right here! Where you going, bro!? [runs off] [calling out] Wait up, man, how're you alive!? [Prismo pulls a brick back in the wall and appears for a brief second after [shocked] The Lich?! Wake up. Wa—Wait, I've changed my mind—[gasp] [watching from above] Wait, why is this happening? It's like a rerun of the worst junk. [while watching the above] Lich life-sucks Prismo's dream host, eliminates Prismo forever. Ugh, it's mad gris bro. And then the Space Police, or whatever they're called, show up because boppin' Prismo is a cosmic crime. I remember feelin' like someone had peeled a layer away from my brain, and my reality was no longer anchored to any point of reference, and I had to fight to keep from being crushed under the weight of an unforgiving new paradigm of ultimate reality. So cool, man. So why am I seeing this again? Uhhh, that's cool... Uhh, that's cool, but do you know what's really cool? Tough guy contest! [flexes bicep] Whoo-hoo! [Does a spin and poses] Tough boys! [groans] Come on, man! Tough Guy contest me! [while Jake continues his re-enactment behind him] Okay, seems like all of Jake's remanifesting themselves, [turns to viewer] but as soon as I break their history it creates a paradox and Jake explodes. [turning to Finn] Whoa, Finn, how'd you get over there? [explodes into dust] Finn, when I die my individual Earth consciousness is going to go all over everywhere while Glob tallies my deeds. [confused] What? I'm going to all around you [starts turning into a tree], in your nose, in your dreams and your socks... "in your dreams?" Yeah, that's what I said, in your dre— [explodes into dust] All this striz happened when Jake and I tried to preserve Prismo's pickles in our dreams, something must have changed when we went to sleep! [zooms out to the still messy room] So, ugh, I just got to hope that Jake tries to do the pickle ritual again. So I can re-enact it with him. Exactly the way it happened, maybe?! Geez! [re-enacting Prismo's ritual]♪ Fallen ally, fallen ally, you're home now in the sky. ♪ Fallen ally, fallen ally, a single tear we cry.♪ I guess I'm headed towards that door.. Dude, I get out of relationships because I don't want to have a discussion about what we're gonna to have for dinner every night! [more distantly] 'Cause when I'm alone... Hehe, all these dudes and their lady problems... That's right, What if the whole world was just some goof's dream? Man, that would be stupid. Whoa! Rrrm, wait a minute... What is this!? This couldn't be a...oh Grod! [looks under the bed] Permanent, opposing, industrial-strength, magnetic bed! [looks at the side] Hand-hewed from a single tree [looks at the bedspread] Oh, man! Look at this mattress! [gasps] What is it? [sniffs] Smells like a blend of cashmere... [sniffs again] Mohair, silk and wool maybe... [touches the blanket] The thread count on this is in the thousands! And it's filled with... [sniffs] Down feathers of a baby griffin! That's illegal! [Turns to nightstand] Glass of milk... This feels like a trap designed by some kind of sick genius! Well... [gulps milk and gets in the bed] hats off to you sir or madam, your trap was a success! Oh my blahs!

[jumps into the jar and gets warped away] [looking around]Whoa...Where the heck am I? [calling out] Wait up, man, how're you alive!? Jake!? I'm coming man![runs off] Finn and I saw your old man host body get destroyed by the— Jake! Don't explode! [reaching his arm out in front of Finn, making him stop]Finn, hold up. Prismo! I saw you die, dude! Yep, I'm still dead. I'm actually talking to you from the past, I set up this plan B scenario in case I ever got croaked for reals. So if this is happening then I guess I got croaked and my pickles ran out. But Jake and I established a bro-bond that could bring me back through his dreams. So, are you actually talking to me right now or are you pretending to in an empty room? I was pretending, but now I can see you. [makes air quotes]What does 'now' meant to you? Uhhh...hurry up I need your help [opens wall and Finn walks through] [Running past] Where you going bro? Wait up man, how're you alive? So where're we going? You've gotta wake up Jake and then...umm, you'll see. I'll see what, Prismo? Shoot, I don't know if I thought this thing all the way through.. [shocked] Whaaaat? Aw, it'll be cool. [nervously] It'll be cool. Dude, I can't believe I died. Jake I'm sorry man. This doesn't feel right. [appearing with Finn] Ok, go wake Jake up and bring him back here [Finn gives the thumbs up and runs to the bed] Whoa, Finn, hey, are you gonna wake up Jake? Yeah, is that gonna kill you again though? My past self is doing plan B right? Uh, yes. Although I gotta say that this is as rickety as yoga balls. Yeah, tell me about it. You tell you about it! I think you would blow up if I did that. Well, anyway, here I go. [shakes Jake] Hey, Jake, wake up. I'm out. [vanishes] [sleepily] Hey, Finn, what's going on? We gotta bounce. [pushing Finn away] No, bro, don't tear me away from nirvana. Wait, nooo! [falls to floor] Oof! [normal voice] I'm okay now. Cool [leading Jake back to Past Prismo] this way! Whoa! Rrrm, wait a minute... What is this!? Prismo?! You're alive! [hugs Prismo's nose on the wall] Well, not yet. Finn, in a second you've gotta stop yourself from waking up Jake. [confused] Stop my who? [panicked] Shoot! Hide! Think we should turn around somewhere, I feel like we're lost. No I was just stalling, don't think about it, c'mon, this way. THAT who. But wait, Jake, that means one of your alternate reality incarnations will sleep for eternity to keep me alive. Cool, dude! OK, Finn, I'm not sure what'll happen if you confront yourself. He might explode. 'He', me or other me? You know what? Forget it. Shut it Prismo, heroes risk everything for their friends. Although I admit you're more Jake's friend than mine. Sometimes you can think someone is totally cool, but you never become besties. Now I don't know why that happens, but regardless let's do this. [dashes out after his past self] Good luck! Whoa, Finn, hey! Are you gonna wake up Jake? [while Finn walks up behind him] Yeah, is that gonna kill you again though? My past self is doing plan B, right? [tapping Past [shocked] What the—!? [explodes into light and a sword appears in the center] [grabbing the sword]This is me? This sword is me? Finn sword, dude. Welcome back, Prismo. Thank you, Finn. [Sticking his head out and giving the thumbs up] Welcome back, Prismo. Thank you, Jake. Thanks for helping me record, Finn. No problem, Marceline. Now, I'm gonna sing something really personal, so don't laugh at me. I would never dream of it... m'lady. [Laughs] Now, start a slow beat, and keep it steady, or it'll mess up everything. You got it! Huh? Finn, you messed the beat up! Marceline, if you're thinkin' about your dad so much, then... why don't you go see 'im? [Strums guitar] He's not worth the effort. Not worth what effort? Well... first, I'd have to draw a circle with a happy face in the center and then... uh... douse it with bug milk. [ [Sighs] And then you're supposed to chant something like [The happy face glows and the candles next to it light up], "Maloso vobiscum et cum spiritum." [Finn laughs and the face changes color.] But... I-I don't really wanna see him. I'm still mad about the thing with the fries. [ Wwwwhhhat?! [The room changes color drastically; a portal to the Nightosphere opens where the face was.] Whoa... whoa!! Aaagh!! Marceline! Finn... what the heck did you do?! I... reunited you with your family? Is this kid your evil servant? I'm not evil, Marceline's dad. I'm super good! "Super good?" [Roars] [Gasps; Lord of Evil grabs Stealing your soul. Dad! [Separates the two] Ugh! You always do stuff like this! Haha! Oh, Marceline! I never know what's gonna set you off! Whoa! Is this the family ax? Wha—? HEY!!! Did you turn it into some kind of lute? [Yelling in anger] Give it back, and get out!!! Okay, I'll go. I've got business to attend to, anyway—sucking up all the souls in Oooooo... [Stammering] WHA—Gh—NO!! See you kids later! [Opens door] My bass! I've unleashed evil onto Ooo ! We've gotta stop 'im, Marceline! Fine... but I'm only coming with you to get my bass back. Hey! How do I kill this guy, anyway? Finn! You can't kill my dad! Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't mean— No! You literally can't kill my dad! He's deathless! Oh... [The Lord of Evil's shadow falls upon him and he stops running.] Huh? [Camera zooms out to show the Lord of Evil.] Who the fluff are you? Um... Well, I'm sure not the guy who's gonna suck out your soul. Good 'cause that's, like, my number one fear. Really!? Well... I know a little exercise for that! Wanna try?? Wow... First... close your eyes. Okay! [Gets pounded by the ax bass.] AAH! You coulda killed me! Ah, but I didn't! And now, aren't you thrilled just to be alive? Yeah, I guess... So what? So... This next part will be all the more... horrifying. [Laughs maniacally as his transformed face moves towards the screen, sucking the fluffy person's soul. Scene goes back to Finn and Marceline.] There!! Below us! A gathering of Fluffy People! May-haps they've seen your father! Marceline... release the It's because they're scared of him. [Camera pans over to the Fluffy Person from earlier. He is floating and moaning. No! We gotta help this guy. I've got some soul food that Jake packed for me. You like, uh, collard greens or country-fried steak? Look. You wanna help him? Help me get my bass back. How will that help hi—? MY DAD STOLE MY BASS GUITAR, FINN!! And when I get it back... I'm gonna break it over his neck and slam my dad back into the Nightosphere! Oh, clam! But first you gotta return the souls your dad sucked back to these sad, little husks. Right, Marceline? [Blows tuft of hair away from her face] Uh, sure, yeah, yeah, we'll do that. So I popped his head like a cork! And I says, "That's what I think of Expanding Earth Theory!" Alright. Huh?! I've got a joke, too. [It's revealed that he sucked Marauder #14's soul. The Yo mama! [Beat] That's right! I'm your mama! [Sucks the marauders' souls] Red Rock Pass. If my dad wants to get through the mountains, he'll have to come through here. We can work together! And smash 'im with this rock! And once he's smooshed, all the souls will go back to their rightful bods. So, finally taking a run at your old man, huh? [Losing patience] Daddy... [Chuckles] Karate kick!! [Kicks Marceline off his shoulders; she lands on the ground hissing.] Marceline!! Keep 'im right there!! HrrrrRAAAAGH!!! Karate chop!! [He chops her; she hisses.] You can't destroy me! [Hisses] [Calming down] No... D-dad... I-I don't wanna destroy you... [Angered] Look, just... stay out of my life!! [Floats away] You're not even alive! You blew it, dude. We're supposed to be a team—a team whose sport is stop-your-dad-from-suckin'-souls... ball. [Sighs] I just want my dad to care about me. Of all history's greatest monsters, you are by far the most evil thing I've encountered. Offer your soul to me, dark one. Wenk wenk. NO! You can't have my soul! I don't even...! Look, just get in here. Wenk wenk. [Kicks penguin away] Keep your crummy soul! Gunter! Who told you you could fly?! [Pointing at Lord of Evil] Wenk. Huh? No one sucks the life from my penguins except me! ...And maybe polar bears, because that's just nature, Gunter. [Flies over to Lord of Evil] You darest encroach upon my domain?! [Lord of Evil's face changes.] You've raised my frosty dander! And for that, I shall— [Lord of Evil shows YES!! Aw, man! He's growing huge! I'm gonna take 'im down! Finn, you're like an ant to him. Oh, yeah? Well, this ant's about to get in his pants! [Deadpan, amused] What? [Stammers, embarrassed] You know! [Picking up Sword of the Dead] Because I'm going to make him uncomfortable while I release those souls! RAAAAAAAAGH!!! [Climbs up Lord of Evil's body] Give up those souls, Marceline's dad! In the name of justice!! Huh? [Not noticing Finn] Oh, Marceline. Still following me? I'll stop following you if you give me back my guitar! [Flicks Finn off with ease] No, Marceline. [Flying upwards] NO ONE FLICKS ME IN THE BUTT WITHOUT MY CONSENT!!! [Descends and stabs the Lord of Evil in the head. Lord of Evil smiles at What? Nah. I totally saw Hot Dog Princess get sucked in here, and I wasn't invited?! I was all, "What the lump?" so I'm crashin' this party! Well, I'll save you... I'LL SAVE ALL OF YOU!! IN YOUR FACE, DAD! Give back that ax, Marceline! You don't respect it enough! Well... you don't respect anything! Dad!! DAD!! I'm outta here! BUT—!! Fine!! Go!! I'm too busy sucking to deal with you! NO, WAIT! Marceline!! Keep talking to 'im! When he's talking, he can't steal souls!! I said I'm outta here! [To himself and digging around in his backpack] Diversion... need... diversion. [He gasps, pulls out the Walkman and plays the song he and Marceline recorded earlier. Both Marceline and her father stop dead in their tracks. Marceline blushes and her father turns around.] Oh, my Glob, you guys! Drama bomb! Marceline, do you really feel this way? Dad, I... Marceline... of course I love you. Dad... I'm sorry I ate your fries. I didn't mean to hurt you. It's okay, Dad. It's... it's really okay. No, it's not okay. They weren't even very good. They were really cold. I love you, Marceline. Don't you ever doubt that. I love you, too, Dad. [Tearing up] Oh, Marceline, I am so— [Flying through the air] YALALALALALALALALALALALALA!!!!! MALOSO VOBISCUM ET CUM SPIRITUM!! [Lord of Evil is transported back to the Nightosphere.] [Low, growling voice] I'll see you in the Nightosphere, ya sick freak. [Marceline gasps] YES!!!! Finn!! How could you do that?! How could I... save the day? How could you embarrass me like that and then stab my dad?! How could I embarrass-save you?? [Marceline attempts to ax [Sighs] I'm glad he's back in the Nightosphere. That was emotionally exhausting. I'm also exhausted emotionally. Or... wait. I mean, I mean physically. I've been meaning to ask you... What's with that pocket on your shirt? Oh, Jake's in here. 'Sup, Jake? Yup! Yeah, totally stuck that landing! Yeah! Woo woo! Man, it's been so long since I've worn the Jakesuit. I forgot how awesome your bod is, bro. Stretchy-arm power! [ Okay! [ Yeah, BMO, show me the stuff, keep it coming! [BMO throws the rest of his tea at Jake's stomach.] Yeah, BMO, unleash the beast! Yah! Unleash the beast! [ Come on, BMO, bring it, that's nothing! [BMO starts scratching Jake's leg.] [yells] You're weak, BMO! You OK, BMO? I am no match for the Jakesuit. That's right! Dog, the Jakesuit is mad strong! This junk could protect me from anything! [muffled] Uh, sorta. Wait, bro, what are you doing up here? You know I'm not actual armor, right? Septuple flip off the tree house! [ Nooo! Ride 'em cowboy! Woo! You were a little rough with the Why didn't you stop me? When you're in my body, it pushes out my brain, so I have no control. C'mon bro, taking pain is easy. You just have to imagine that every bruise is a hickey from the Universe. And everyone wants to get with the Universe. [raises eyebrows up and down] I bet you wouldn't be saying that nonsense if I wore you as a suit. I bet I would be saying that nonsense. OK bro, let's see how you like it. I'll bring the pain! Do it bro, get in here! Haha yes! Time to bring the pain! Eh? [laughs] Man, are you kidding? You give up? You have to like, punch me in the face. Hmm. I thought I was. This is hard. I can't even make a fist. How do you control my body so well? Dude, I'm graceful. Mom raised me graceful. [laughs] Dude, what the Bjork? A-ha! Here we go! Dream Journal of a Boring Man, Volume 12. Uh, Jake, what are you doing? There's all kinds of pain, Finn. Dude, come on, don't do this. Ah. Okay, let's see. Ooh, this one looks good. And it's not too long, only seven pages! [laughs] Okay, here we go. [clears throat] [reading off page] "In my dream, I was eating jasmine rice. But it was also brown rice. And it was also my mother." Huh? Where am I? [looks around] Oh, yeah. Hey, Finn, how long have I been out? I don't know. A couple hours Say what?! Why are you still reading? It's actually not that bad. There's a bunch where he knows he's dreaming. Here, let me read you a little. [reading off page] "So I said to the first guy, if everyone in my dream is me, then you are me. And he said, I am who? And I said, me. And he said, who is me? And I said, you. [Jake sighs and flops down in exasperation.] And he said, what about you? And I said, no you!" [stops reading] It's like he's trying to solve a mystery that doesn't exist! You want me to keep going? No, I'm hungry. Yeah, I'm hungry too. How about a truce while you go make us some lunch? Oh, I didn't know we were allowed to call truces. I'll totally remember that the next time my doggy bag is hurtling towards a fence post. You know, you could use the opportunity of cooking me food to mess with me. [gasps] Wait a sec, you just gave me an idea! Yeah? [Jake laughs evilly.] Uh-oh. Oh, look out, you gonna make me something gross? Soemthing spicy? You know I can take it! [Jake blindfolds Ta-da! Meatloaf? That's my favorite dish. Mmm-mmm. What did you do to it? I assure you, it's delicious. Okay, well, you're really terrible at this. [ Yummy! Oh, that's just mean. Admit you're wrong, and you can have some of this delicious meatloaf! Nah, I'm good. Jake, it's my special occasion phone! Someone's calling me to tell me about a special occasion. So? So can you walk me over there? I wanna see who it is! [Jake walks Jake! Seriously, don't do this! Tell me I win, dude! No, absolutely not. Alright. Say goodbye to Flame Princess thinking you're cool! I'm gonna embarrass the Bjork outta you! Oh, hey, you came! I got worried because you didn't answer special occasion phone. My relatives are waiting inside. What? Well, that's why I called on special occasion phone. All my less-evil family members are here for dinner. Come eat! Finn, this is my family. [ [whispering to Jake] Jake, whatever you're about to do, please don't do it. What are you doing in front of my family?! Hold on, bro. Perhaps it is a non-flameish custom unknown to us. [as Finn] Nope! Just doin' the kind of stuff I do all the time! This is a nightmare come true for me, sister. What are you doing?! [as Finn] Don't you wanna see more? Oh, my Bjork! No! I don't want to see more! Wait, what's that in your mouth? Jake? [in normal voice] Oops! Busted. Are you controlling Finn? Yeah, I'm causing Finn pain. We have a bet going on. And you made him dance like a baby, semi-nude, in front of my family? Wow, that's pretty hardcore. [chuckles] What? Good luck, Finn. Hope you win! I will! Hmm! [in Korean] Finn! Oh, of all days! Where are you going? Jake, where are you? I'm right here. [in Korean] Oh! 'Sup? What's T.V. doing here? I thought all the kids found apartments. [in Korean] No matter what, I think he's stay-at-home. Ha-ha! That's my boy. Momma's basement baby. [ [in Korean] Jake, what are you doing? Please tell me. Oh, it's this bet we're doing. It's not really a bet. It's more like a showdown. I'm trying to get him to admit that it's hard when someone wears you as a suit. How do I win the bet, Lady? Hey, Dad? Why don't you try jumping in a volcano? [resumes typing] Yes! So, what are we doing, bro? [ The Universe is going to have a full-on make-out session with you, bro. I'm talkin' minimum tier 8. Behold! Fire Wolves? That's your plan? Please. Oh no, bro, that's just fortuitous circumstance! [ How you like it, bro? Pretty painful, huh? Eh, whatev. Hmm. Looks hot. Oh yeah, bro! The pain-train has arrived at the station! Choo-choo! [He wraps one leg around a rock on top of the volcano and lowers Finn down into the volcano.] I'm ready, bro! Bring it! You're nothin', lava! You're a bum! I can handle you! Look, just say stop, and you won't get burned. [yells] Never! Okay, bro. This'll pretty much wreck up your whole life, so think about it. Bring it! Yeah, baby, feels good, love it, lovin' that heat on my skull! Okay...I'm gonna lower you some more...probably gonna cook up your brain. Oh, yeah, give it to me! [thinking to himself] Dang, he's flippin' crazy! This isn't gonna do anything, he's never gonna give up! What happened? You robbed me of the win! You're right, man. My bruises are hickeys from the Universe. And I should just accept that. Yeah boy! In yo' face! Yeah, in my face. Dangit, Finn. Who's ready for rehabilitation? We'll start with full-body immersion therapy. [starts making kissing noises] [screaming] No! [quietly screaming to himself] Yes!  Hey, man. Oh, hey, Finn! [laughs] So you got my map? [laughs] [laughs] Yeah. [laughs] So... how's your experiment going? Ah, it's goin' great. I really feel like I fit in, [laughs] so to speak. [laughs uncontrollably] So... are you ready to come home? Nah, I think I was just gonna keep being a brick for a while. Umm... what are you doing again? Finn, ever since I was little, I wanted to see what it's like to be a brick in a brick shack when the brick shack falls down. And this shack is gonna fall down. Just look at it. Like sandcastles in the sun, baby. [laughs] You're too young; you wouldn't understand. [laughs] You're right. I don't understand. But I'm cool with your mystical journey or whatever. I'm gonna leave this walkie-talkie so we can stay in touch. Just in case. What? No, man, bricks don't stay in touch! Dude, BMO is, like, really worried about you. Aww. You tell that little goofball I said hi. I will. [looks at sun] Well, I guess I should head back. Oh. Really? So soon? Yeah, well, it took me, like, half a day to get here. Besides, you're just a brick, right? [laughs] Yeah. [leaving] Alright, see ya, Jake! Bye! Okay, back to being a brick. [beat] I'm so bored. [blows raspberry] Ooh, I'm starting to get a little tippy in my teacups. [quietly] A bunny! Looks like our long-eared friend is on to something. Bunnies love to dig. He's making a supreme effort, and I think I can guess why. That's right. A carrot, grown out here free and wild, probably the result of a seed pooped out by a passing bird. But what's this? A mysterious rustling in the bush. Could mean trouble. Mr. Bunny seems to think so. His sensitive whiskers quiver at the hint of imminent danger. Unfortunately for Mr. Bunny, this is what nature is all about. It's a male deer. Not a threat to Mr. Bunny in the predatory sense, but still above him in the food chain. Mr. Bunny, wishing to avoid an encounter, hops away to safety. Wow, deers are jerks. Hey, man. You know I can hear everything you say, right? What?! Arrrrrgh! No! I had no idea. Yeah, but you saw me leave the walkie-talkie, and I left it on. You know that, right? Hi, Jake! Hi, BMO. Need anything? A soda? No. So what's Mr. Bunny doing now? It's not about the bunny! The bunny is incidental to the brick experiment. Oh. Sorry, man. Forget about the bunny. Sorry, man. Sorry, Jake. Look, we'll, uh, we'll leave you alone. [pushes in walkie-talkie antenna] Finn? Are you still there? Finn? BMO? Mr. Bunny retreats to its warren. Its homemade comfort is some consolation to help pass the hungry night. Twilight falls on the peaceful forest, a twilight unaware of the struggles it both soothes and conceals. The crickets begin to stir, rehearsing their musical rhapsodies. In the distance, flashes of heat lightning illuminate a purple summer sky. Even angry deer, at last, must come to rest. And so it is with our erstwhile antagonist, who has disappeared into a stand of trees, perhaps to dream of tomorrow's pointless battles. Oh, my Gob, it's a crazy storm! This might be it! This weather might knock the whole thing down! [laughs, then stops and looks at the rabbit] If a definition of bravery exists, then this must be it. A lone bunny, facing off against the elements, ineffectually pushing around some twigs with his pink bunny nose, a symbolic gesture, perhaps, but sometimes that's all we have. The wind is beginning to pick up. It's becoming clear that Mother Nature has not just knocked on the door, she has come in, sat down, and poured herself a drink. Mr. Bunny has no friends, no family, no loved ones of any kind. The wind is really picking up now. Small puddles gathering around the entrance to Mr. Bunny's cozy home are beginning to grow in size and connect with one another. It won't be long now. But what's this?! Looks like this unflagging little hero of a bunny will have some help, though! A family of friendly beavers appears to have taken up the cause. Often called nature's architects, these intrepid mammals are sparing no effort to shore up the endangered burrow. Here's an unusual sight. It's a Sea Lard! You'd expect to see a few mudscamps out in weather like this, but here we have a rare treat indeed. This little beauty is pretty far outside of her natural habitat, but I've heard it said by wise old salts schooled in ancient maritime lore that storms will sometimes blow them off course to a remarkable degree. Looks like we've got some pretty good evidence tonight. Yes, sir, sometimes those old sailors know what they're talking about. It's a triumph of experience versus the secondhand verities of musty academic tomes. This feisty Sea Lard is pitchin' right in to save the rabbit hole, belying its slothful reputation. She uses her prodigious swiveling behind to increase the size of the hole, while the beavers continue to reinforce the sides with straw and stick. Times like these, supposed cruelty and indifference of the natural world, all too often its most salient feature, pale before the nobler instincts of even our most humble kin. In the morning light, few signs remain of the summer storm that battered this idyllic glen. The beavers are finished with their work and are heading home. The Sea Lard looks like she's gonna wander the woods for a while. Maybe she'll find her way back to the ocean and write a novel about her experiences. Mr. Bunny is exhausted but can rest easy knowing that his home is secure. But alas, the bunny's rest is short-lived. The deer is back. The deer, perhaps confused by the antler-like appearance of Mr. Bunny's protective dam, is now testing the situation. The bunny is unsure of where this is going. And with a single smash from the deer's powerful front hooves, the bunny's home is under attack! Mr. Bunny has hopped to safety and can only watch as the deer continues its relentless rampage on the only home he knows. A couple more mighty smashes, and the dam—the dam has been breached! Water is now flooding in! The deer continues its attack! This deer's misplaced rage, combined with its size and weight, is more than enough to bring down the weakened walls, which are now starting to give, aided by the unforgiving weigh from the tree above. Even Mr. Deer, in his blind fury, seems to sense what's about to happen as he steps to one side! It's over. The warren has been destroyed. An injustice of astronomical levels. Words fail me. Actually, he doesn't seem that upset. He's on his feet, checking out his new surroundings—even the deer is impressed! As if confused by the events, he performs a comical double-take and retreats into the forest. Ladies and gentlemen, this bunny is indomitable! [laughs] This bunny has the right attitude. Who cares about being a brick in a wall of a fallen-down shack? There's something bigger than that, and the bunny has answers. [stretches out of wall] Teach me, Mr. B! Aw. Jake? Jake? You there, buddy? Over. Hey, Finn. Hey, man. You ready to come home? That sounds good. Awesome. See you soon. [tosses walkie-talkie in the trash] Yus! Puppies! Puppies! Puppies! [They enter the house] Hey Jake! Hey Lady! We came to see your new pups! [ 얘들아 안녕! ("Hi guys!") [ Charlie, [Charlie yawns] T.V., [T.V. rolls over from being so round] Viola, [legs wobble] Kim Kil Whan, and this sweet little lady is [Jake is tearing up and [sniffles] Yeah, Finn. I love all my little babies so much. [Dabs eyes with [Viola walks off and No way! Check this out! [Lady shows up with a reusable grocery bag and 천만에 ("You're welcome.") It's Mom's manual for raising beautiful children. Oh dude, Mom! She'd have been so proud to see you and your pups. [Jake begins to bawl] [ Aw, BMO! When was the last time you washed your controller? [ [Jake freaks out and collects all of the pups into his arms] We were just wrestling! Cool uncle wrestling. Um, ah, I-I think it's gettin' kinda late. Um, puppies need sleep. Okay. [ [Lady kicks Oh. [ [ Yeah, okay. [ We'll hang out soon. Ah, no prob, Bob. Huh, congrats again. [They leave] [ [ [yawns] Breakfast time. [He gets up to go make breakfast] 자기 지금 뭐 하는거야... ("What are you doing, honey?") Sorry honey, I'm on guard duty. [ [While playing, Jake grabs the ingredients] Recipe for french toast. Ingredients butter, three large eggs, a wide dash of vanilla, milk, ten slices of bread-white, brown, multi-grain, or country loaf. In a large mixing bowl crack the eggs and whisk the milk, vanilla, and all eggs and honey. [While Jake talks to himself] When your consistency is satisfactory, set mixture aside. Dip bread in the mixture and soak thoroughly. Heat your oven to a high heat and sauté your egg soaked bread slices till golden and toasted and serve hot with sugar, cinnamon sugar, jam, ice cream, meat, whipped cream- [ Perform CPR, they might be dead! AHHHH! [ You guys are getting big! Okay! [yawns] Excuse me. Mom's manual suggests that I read you guys a story. [Pulls out "Baby Eating Fox and the Babies"] This was your daddy's favorite book when he was cute like you! [Where his name, " This is a lot darker than I remember! Um, gimme a sec. [ [gasps] Get that book out of here! Yeah, okay. Sorry sweeties, Mom's manual says no. [T.V. throws a rubber duck at 자기야, 애들 데리고 나가서 바람좀 쐬고 오지 그래? ("Hey honey, why don't you go outside and have some fresh air with the kids?") Take 'em out for fresh air huh? [He stretches to look outside] There m- there might be a giant fox out there. [falls asleep] Or some-some other predator. [wakes up] Hey! [The pups were reading the book and [wakes up] Hey, free book. Hey! Hey everybody look! Look at this book I found about eating babies! [fox walla] They just sit there while you eat them. [Shows a picture of the baby walking into the fox's mouth] Whoa! Eatin' babies. Why haven't we been eating babies this whole time? [coughs out the rock it was eating] I don't know, but I'm going to go eat one right now. [fox walla] Okay everyone, your mom wanted me to take y'all out side. [T.V. reaches for a flower, but is pulled back] Ah ah ah, be careful. [Charlie flies up to catch a butterfly, but is pulled down] No Charlie, no. Too much germs, you know? [The butterfly glances back in response to being called "germy"] Everybody just stick together and don't do anything and we can all take a nap. Then- [ AHHHH! OH MY GLOOB! No! NoOoOoO! IT'S EVERY PARENT'S WORST NIGHTMARE! NO! No! Noo! [ [ [Lady comes down to see 제이크, 자기 혼자 난리치는 거야. 우리 애들 걱정 안 해도 돼. 자기가 너무 과잉보호라니까. ("Jake, you're getting obsessed just all by yourself. Our kids have nothing to worry about. You're being overprotective.") No, no it's- it's all in the manual you see- it's- it-it's got a fe- [falls asleep] 아이야이야. 필요 없을 때만 난리라니까. ("Ai yai yai! He makes a fuss whenever it's not necessary.") [The foxes are eyeing Jake from the bushes] Is that a baby? It doesn't look right. Why's he so sweaty. And hairy. Look, fellas, there's never gonna be a perfect baby. Times like this ya just gotta dive right in. [The foxes move in] Goochy goochy goo! [Playing with Viola] 아, 얘들아, 가서 아빠 좀 도와드려라. [Oh, kids, go and help dadddy.] [ What the- What are you doing?! Let me go! [struggles in vain] Hold on, hold on a minute. Just- just lemme- Y'all better watch out! [Tries to stretch, but is too tired. He looks up and sees the pups flying towards him] Puppies?! What are you doing?! Go back inside! The manual's gonna flip! Dad! The manual's a buncha junk! Just give us a chance.  Stay back Jakey, my manual says it's too dangerous. [Holding holomanual that is freaking out (it's all it can do anyway)] Mom. Your manual's a buncha junk! Look what I can do! [Flexing his mutant powers' muscle (and his independence), Jake gives the cobra an extra-large knuckle sandwich and laughs] Oh... dear... glob! [Flashback ends] I'm sorry for being such a little stinker kids. Come on and show the old man watcha got! 수학! ("Mathematical!") [The pups crash into the ground and form a Super Pup] 아빠 몸체이동! [Move Dad into body!") [ 무지개 뱅! ("Rainbow Bang!") [The pups blast the foxes to temporarily blind them] 프리즘 TBA 작동! ("Initiate prism cyclone!") [They spin like a spinning top, throwing and zapping the foxes] You did! I'm super proud y'all and I'm duper sorry too. [Gathers the pups in his arms] I've been tryin' to make you know about safety without actually learning about safety the way I did, by not listening to MY mom when that snake jumped out of the policeman's boombox. [ Yup! I've been tryin' to make them about safety without actually learning about safety the way I did, by not listening to MY mom when that snake jumped out of the policeman's boombox. Hey guys. I'm back. [walks up the stairs] [BMO and Did you ruin it? Nah, nah, it's cool. It turns out the pups can pretty much take care of themselves. They don't really need me around. Oh. Yeah. I guess rainicorns age really fast. They're basically like older than me already. Kil Whan has a beard now! Oh! Ah, it's okay! I got a slammin' family right here too! [hugs them] Plus all my stuff is here. [Coughs and pushes Marceline off of Bartram with his robotic arm] I warned you, dingle. I can hear the crown's promise of power. Invading my brain! [Coughs up snow slug and ascends] [Uses his ice powers to put out the fire and turns toward the Destiny Gang]. Destiny Gang! [Freezes them] Yay! [hurls jagged shaped ice at the rest] Careful there. Careful! Oh, dangit! [Runs towards the cave bushes with Jake] Oh, Simon [While inside cave staring at the bomb.] [Gasp] one more hit and that baby's gonna burst! Ice lightning! Ah, dingle! What's happening?!! [Sees a frightened Bartram] Bar Bar! I'll save you [hugs him and puts up a ice shield that encases them both] Finn? Finn?! Hey guy, where's my buddy? Oh, when he wished for the Lich to have never existed [sips mug, and lets it go, it floats upward.] Finn left my time room and entered his wish altered reality. We can watch him on my TV wall. [A remote materializes and Oooh... Whoa. Alternate-wish-world-Finn is mad uglies! [Shift to Bartram] Hey, I'm mad uglies too! [Still holding Bartram and hoisting himself up to look over the shield] Everything looks nuts! Yes, sometimes a well intentioned wish can lead to... "nuts." But you know, you get a wish too. [Excitedly] What?! Yup, totally. [Hits mute on the remote.] You can have anything you want. I wish for- a sandwich! A sandwich, your gonna waste your one wish on a sandwich?! You don't want anything else? Nah, sandwich is good, [Demonstrates the size with this hands.] maybe about... this big.... or this big. On ciabatta bread maybe... mmm I don't know, whatever you have is your choice. Dude, I'll just make you a sandwich! You should use your wish on something important. [Silent] You know... on someone who might need it. [Hints with his eyes by looking at TV wall, Jake just stares blankly] I'm talking about him over there! Oooh... Oh! Finn? Huh? What, what on earth did this? I did this. No, that's not possible. I raised you better than that! It's true...[Begins to laugh then cackle] [Gasps loudly and hugs the baby.] I put out there fire... but I... also made the bomb go off. Urgh! The crown it compels me to- ice up everything! [Laughs manically and stops once he hears the cries of his sibling.] Urghah! I'm sorry mom, dad, little sibling. [Sighs] [He walks over to his family and picks them up to place them on Bartram]. I'm too dangerous... to be around. What are you doing? Take them... far away Bar Bar. [Smacks Bartram's hindquarters.] Leave me! Leave me... Looks like your friend is having a pretty rough time. [Holding a sandwich and chewing a bit of it in his mouth.] Mmm, yeah, ah well, it's Finn's wish. Let's just see how it plays out. I got confidence in my boy! [Shifts backside into a chair structure and sits.] Besides, I'll hang onto my wish in case i need it. [Takes a bite of the sandwich and the pickle falls out onto the floor.] Awww! Don't worry dude I gotcha covered! [Materializes a jar of pickles.] They're homemade. I love you Prismo. Oh yee!! [Laughs and blushes.] [Shifts back to normal to grab jar.] I'm serious man, you're like a strong number three on my 'Cool Guys List.' Ah man, my dad use to make pickles [Opens jar and takes one out], it's all he use to talk about, he'd obsess about them all the time, when I'd come in from playing he'd be like "Here, [Nodding] Rise... my wintry warriors... Tromo! Trami! Why am I cold and confused?! Fear not, icicle child! For I have brought you into a new life! Eeh? The Mertens kid? The age of ice and whispering snow! [Frees Tromo, who runs to free Trami.] Hey, crack me loose T! Come on! You see Big Destiny anywhere? Big D's chillin' over here, wasteland style. Come back! Only I can protect ya'll. [Touches ground to freeze gang.] Stay... Aaa! My kicks! Can't you hear the- the whispers? Forget Big D! Let's go! I've taught you well, my traitorous gang. [Crawls on top of Big Destiny's back.] The voices... they tell me to freeze the world. Get off of me, you weirdo! I am the end and the beginning. I am the hand of madness. [Hears barking and turns in direction.] Jake? Dude, I get out of relationships because I don't want to have a discussion about what we're gonna have for dinner every night! Cause when I'm alone I can just sit on the couch and I'm hungry I can eat whatever I want. It's not like [High pitched voice] "What should we eat for breakfast? Wait! We should coordinate!" [Normal voice] That's a pain. [Eating sandwich, talking with full mouth.] Mm-mm, man your view of relationships is very bleak, don't you get lonely? I have friends. [Enters doorway] Hello, hello. Hey, so I brought over the- [Gasp, as he sees Prismo and Jake in the hot tub.] What is this singular doing in this realm?! He's just here making a wish Cosmic Owl. But I brought games! We were gonna hang! ...after. Come on, get in here. Jake? Jake! [Pulls the dog out. But a pair of arms are grabbing his waist. They turn out to be Marceline's who is now a skeleton.] I warned you... you butt... Raah! [Kicks Marcline's skull.] [Pants heavily.] [Now conscious and ferociously biting Finn's metal arm.] [Voice altered] Don't worry Jake, I'll share the secrets of ice and snow with thee. Heh heh, the power of frost! Power of frost! The power of fros- Three, two, one... go! We're three nice dudes, havin' fun! We got warm bubble water, on our buns! I love this spa, and that's a fact! But if I stay too long, I get a pruny back! [Begins beat boxing as well.] Jake... Jake, what are you doing? [Possessed, crawls towards Finn.] Back off my crown, Jake! I warn you! Hey man, I'm right here! That's not me man! [Grows into a large threatening form.] Ah ha ha ha ha! [Flies up and blast him with ice. This causes the screen to go static.] Finn! I'm in the spa bath! Oh man! Maybe now, you would like to use your wish? [Panics and inflates his head] Make Finn okay! I wish for a safe Finn! [cite] Wait, dude! Look, I like you, so you should know my wishes always got an ironic twist to them. It's like a monkey's paw kind of thing. [Shrinks back to normal] What? You just gotta be really specific. Say your wish is "I wish for a back rub." Who's gonna give it to you? A dirty man? A bear? And where does this "masseuse" come from? Do I zap some guy away from his family dinner? Leave some kid traumatized? Woo! [Nasal voice] Mom, where did dad go? [High pitched voice] Oh, I don't know son he just disappeared from the table... sorry. [Looks shocked.] You see, Jake there are rules to this stuff, wishing an event to be changes elements before and after it. Memories will be destroyed, babies will not be born. Potential worlds could be evaporated by your wish! [Vomits.] [Exits the hot tub.] Ewww! Uugh! [Exits the tub.] I'm sorry, that's a lot of pressure man... Focus, Jake! [Materializes hard boiled egg.] Here, eat this egg, it's brain food. [Eats egg and picks himself up.] Oh, okay. Ooo, think... think! [Sighs] Okay, there is a way to bring back all life and get home. [Stares at Prismo with surprise.] You just have to ch... Chaa... Chaaange... The Lii- The lipstick! The Liiich's... The Lich's... Ooowiii....sssh...ish [Gasps] Change the Lich's wish! And go home. And go home! Okay, okay, I wish Lich's wish- was for me. Aa-ah! And Finn, to go back home to Ooo! I can work with that. Alright, this has been nice, see ya! [Granting the wish, Jake disappears from the room.] Woo! [Waves goodbye.] I wish- for the extinction of all [head starts shaking rapidly] li-i-if for Finn and Jake to go back home to Ooo. Huh!? No wait, what's not what I wished for! Sorry guy, you only get one wish. Hey Jake, did you see that? Monkey's paw. Jake! What the? Why would the Lich wish... what? Jake?! [Getting teary eyed.] It worked! [Getting hugged by Jake.] Jake! This is serious! Something really messed up is happening! Ha ha! It already happened! And it never happened! What? What happened?! Nothing, cause I saved everybody! Oh Honey, I told you, you can take the sign off when you tell me where you hid daddy's crown jewels. Wenk! Gunter! Huh? [Sees jewels flying through the window, the force is enough to knock him off his throne.] Woo wowsers! What's that? [Picks up jar and reads a small note.] Hmm... [Voice over] If you want to come back and hang out some time. Call me - P.[The letter P glows pink] I gotta get that guy a girlfriend. Hey, Kim Kil Whan. We solved the mystery of the haunted office. It was Clockbear the whole time... Yeah, uh, Jake's around here somewhere. Man, it's crazy to think I was born here. In this alley. Popped right out of my dad's head for some reason. [ [Coughs] Let's go, son. [Laughs menacingly as he shapeshifts in preparation to create a portal.] Son? I ain't nobody's son but Joshua and Margaret! Though it is weird that you got exactly the same stretchy power as me. [Laughs] It's not weird. It's fate! We have to leave, like - [He shoots out a bunch of lasers which form a portal] right now! Wait, can Finn come with us? We're kind of a package deal. Oh, that's kind of a bad idea. Our home world's atmosphere is, uh, poisonous to his kind. Well then I'd better write him a note. [He takes out a pen and some paper and writes a note.] Destiny calls! Whoa! [From off screen] Jake? Who are you, anyway? My name is Why do you keep laughing? [Laughs] I'm nervous. [Laughs and then grunts and coughs as they land.] Welcome to your home planet - Nerraw. Great fantasy sci-fi vibe, man. And that black hole really adds an extra dimension to the place. Years ago, I left this beautiful planet and traveled to Ooo to implant my destiny-rich, stretchy DNA into a compatible host. That explains a lot, actually. But now I'm dying. What? I used the last of my strength [coughs] to bring you home. [Gasps] He's here! Huh? [Gasping and whispering indistinctly to each other.] Is that Jake? It's really him! Did you see him? Look over there. Look. That's Jake! Warren, how does everyone know me? Because you're the most important person to have ever lived. Behold! The Jakeseum! A museum? All about me?! [Gasping] It's Jake! Jake! Jake! It's Jake! Will you sign my prophecy book? Will you sign my pretzel? This is wild. But it feels so right, you know? [Gasps when he notices some pictures on the wall] Hey! It's my fifth birthday party. And my graduation. And when I put a snail in my mouth. And when a snail put me in its mouth. And... [The final picture depicts [Laughs] That's an artist's interpretation of the great prophecy. Tomorrow, you are prophesied to battle Ixcano, a monster with tentacles stretching across the galaxy to strangle everything. You alone can banish him to the darkness. I've researched your world and created the ideal child room. See? [They enter a bedroom.] Space stuff, dinosaurs, and cowboys. Cool. But you know it's a little late to try connecting with me, right? [Gasps] Is that clown cake for me? [He shrinks himself and excitedly begins eating the cake.] [Chuckles] I got you something else, too. [He holds up a wrapped present.] What do you think of your old dad's present? [Wearing the belt] I love it! Still never gonna call you dad, though. Oh, I wouldn't dream of asking. But I hope you don't mind if I still wear this. [He is wearing a matching belt inscribed with "Proud Pop".] [Cheering] Good luck, Jake! Savior us! [Laughs] This is the Sacred Temple of Pannishment. The temple door can only be unlocked by a stretchy dog. With key ha-a-a-a-a... [He trails off as he sees the door] Uh... Beyond this door, there lies an ancient, awesome weapon called the Panzark. I am so ready for this. This must be why I can stretch. Yeah, that totally tracks. Hup! [Struggling] This is so complicated and rewarding. You're doing great, son! Almost there. [Grunting] [Chanting] Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! The Panzark! [Grunting, he picks up the Panzark and carries it outside.] Yay! [Moans] Saving the galaxy's exhausting. I'm dying... for a soft pretzel with mustard. [Groans] [Reading] "Pri-tzels"! Oh. "Pri-vate". [From behind curtain] Hello, there, you handsome young devil. Have we met? [Jake slithers through the curtain and sees Warren talking to himself in a mirror.] Oh wait, it's just me! I didn't recognize this smooth, young skin or these vigorous kneecaps. Oof! [Removing lid from the lap tray] It's another clown cake, with a side of cocktail hot dogs. Dude, weren't you, like, dying? [Ignoring him] Shush, son! [He bats the clown cake to the floor and points out the window.] Ixcano approacheth! Oh, dang. I'll go grab the Panzark. So how do I- You just gotta stretch through the convolutions of the Panzark to activate its kill beam. More stretching, huh? [He grunts as he enters the Panzark.] Here comes the hero. Stretch, baby! Stretch! You're doing it, son! Ugh. This is too much. Jake! Jake! Jake! Ja- What's going on? Where's that Ixcano jerk? I have a confession. There is no Ixcano. I made it all up. So... you're not really dying? No, I was dying. I needed to siphon your precious stretchy essence to keep me young and virile. I use these belts as a conduit. The more you stretch, the stronger I grow! I've done it hundreds of times, to hundreds of sons. [He demonstrates by stretching his palm to show himself draining energy from a set of other figures.] But I never felt guilty before. Maybe it's because you're so much cooler than my other kids. Well, I am cool. Or maybe it's this feeling your kind calls... low-key affection? I- I low-key affection you, son. [He kisses Jake on the head.] I'm sorry, Dad. [Begins crying] I wasn't powerful enough to destroy Ixcano! [Sobbing] What? No. It was just me stretching the whole time. The Panzark. The people. You're just saying that to make me feel better. I'll prove it. [He shapeshifts to resemble Finn.] "I'm Finn! I like pizza and dangerous girls." And here's Joshua! [He extends a new appendage and shapeshifts it to resemble Joshua.] "I'm no [Chuckles] Do more! [Creates Lady Rainicorn.] "I'm Lady! Neigh." Oh, I know. You like parties! [Creates a bunch of party bears.] Here's a bunch of party bears! [Laughs] Make more party bears! And make the tree house! Put party bears on the tree house! Put party bears in the sky! [Chuckles weakly] Okay. Keep stretching, you old phoney. It only makes me stronger! [He stands up, revealing that he has switched the belts.] Belt switch! But how?! Old-fashioned grifting, ya rube! My real dad taught me that trick. But I was a proud pop! I'm the proud pop of a whole bunch of pups. The belt totally applies to me as well. [He shapeshifts to look like a photograph of his children.] See? Five stretchy pups. Whuh-oh. You saved me after all! [He tries to open a portal, but he doesn't have the energy.] Out of juice. I need those pups! Don't even think about it! Can't wait to meet my grandkids and drain their essence. [The rocket takes off.] Aw, nah! [He grabs the rocket out of the sky.] Leave my kids alone! [He moves the rocket towards the black hole.] If you destroy me, you'll be stuck on that rock forever! My pups are worth it! [He throws the rocket into the black hole.] Not the singularity! I just wanted to live forever! [He leaps out of the rocket as it gets spaghettified and looks at the black hole below him.] I see now. This fleshy form has taken me as far as it can. I'm going 4-D, baby. [He is spaghettified.] Bye, Warren Ampersand. Thanks for reminding me what it means to be a good dad [He reverts to his normal yellow color.] by being the worst dad ever. Never even got a pretzel. You've got a lot of meat, Wildberry Princess. Yeah, well, you know. Thanks for cook-a-looking for us. Oh, you're welcome, Finn, and thank you for answering my urgent summons. Hey, yeah. How can we aid thee? [Eats a piece of pie] Oh, it's nothing really. Someone's trying to kill me. Still tastes good. It's no big deal. Finish your pie. It is a big deal, and I demand deets. Okay. [Mouth full] I'm listening, but I'm gonna keep eating. [Chews pie tray] [Goes over to a table] I suspect that I've been targeted by the Guild of Assassins. Whoa, how do you know? I found this note stabbed to my door... man. [Lifts up a note from the Guild of Assassins with a knife pierced through it] [Gasps] Princess, we vow to protect your juice. Right, Jake? Sometimes, I think there's a monster who lives in my stomach, and that's why I'm hungry all the time. [Giggles and continues eating] Uhh, Princess, let's continue this briefing outside. I can't look at his mouth when he gets like this. [Whispering] Princess, want me to finish off your pie? [ [Jumps on Jake's face] Quiet! Or you die! [Points a syringe of poison at him]. [Gasps] You're the assassin! [Saluting] Me-mow, assassin second class, ...but once I take out a princess, I g'aduate to full membership. Well, I'm no princess, sister! Yes, I know, but since you've blown my cover, you will slay Wildberry Princess. What!? I'd rather be injected with poison! Oh. Uh... okay. I mean, I will assassinate Wildberry Princess. Good. Oh, and if you try to trick me, I'll poison you. [Climbs into Jake's nose] [Stifled] My nose! [It should be noted that until otherwise noted all lines from Me-mow show her inside of Blagh! It's like worn garbage up in here! You done in there, Jake? Oh, uh, yeah. So, um, Wildberry Princess. So, maybe it wouldn't be so bad to be killed. [Nervously backs off] W-w-why would you say that? Dude, are you trying to freak her out? I don't know. I'm just thinking out loud here. Are you trying to freak me out? Uh, I'm sorry, Wildberry Prin...cess... [Hears bells, looks at a bag of meat, grabs Wildberry Princess's crown] You should... let me... do something... and... it will be...good. [Places Wildberry Princess's crown on the meatbag] What's going on out there? [Looks through Jake's nostril to see the meatbag with Wildberry Princess's crown] [Punching the meatbag] Eat this! And that! Ooh, how do you like this, Princess! Duoo! [confused] Uh... That's very good? I'm gonna pick you up now and carry you... to the window! Jake, what are you... No! Stop! Please! Wildberry Princess is dead! [Puts a finger to his mouth] Shh... [Gives a thumbs up, Finn and Wildberry Princess are speechless] You did it! Well done! I guess I'll be on my way. Princess! Oh, Princess! [Wildberry guards rush into doorway] You're alive! We saw your crown next to a pile of dirtied meat, then we skipped on the meat and I thought I tasted your juice, but it was just blood from the meat. We're so glad it wasn't actually you! [Angry yell] Grraa!! You liar! [She injects Jake with the half of the poison from the syringe] [pained groan] Oooh! [ Jake? Okay, Jake. I've injected you with half the poison, you'll be dead in thirty minutes, unless you kill the princess, which is when I'll give you the antidote [Me-mow holds up a tube of pink liquid with her tail] Finn [grabs Finn's shirt] help me! What's wrong? If you say anything, I'll stab you in the brain! Uhh... Finn, uh, sing mom's lullaby. I'm so tired, Finn, from the meat. Please, you have to lull me to sleep. Uhhh... I know you carry mom's music box around in your backpack! Dude, I'm not going to sing mom's lullaby in front of other people... Please, pleeeaaase... Alright, real quick while the princess is distracted. [he pulls out the music box and starts playing it; he begins singing "Sleepy Puppies"]. [ Dude, stop playing games! This is serious! Cat... noise? Oh, cats go "meow." Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow. Shh! Meowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeow! Shh! Shh! Shh! [Finn continues] [muffled] Jake! Jake! What are you doing?! [whispers] Sorry... [ [asleep] Gonna double cross Jake... and leave him to die... Phew... If I can just grab that antidote... [He pokes Me-mows face twice then grabs it] Ah-ha! [asleep] Puppy... hoodies... I did it! What the flop, Jake! [quiet] Noooooo!! Treachery! Hiya! [ Time's running out, Jake! Do you want the antidote, or not? What is wrong with you! [Clearly intoxicated] Hey, everybody, everything's cool... Everything's not cool, Wildberry Princess is still in danger! Right, right, well, we should take her somewhere safer... Don't make me give you the rest. I know where to stash you, princess. Follow me. [ Here, nobody can take us by surprise. Finn, stand here with your back to the cliff. I'll stay with Wildberry Princess. [gravely] To do what must be done. [He prepares his hands to push Wildberry Princess] Oh, my, look at how close to the edge I am! Do it, Jake, do it! I...I...I probably shouldn't! Huh? Jake! [Falls over weakly] I'm full of poison... The assassin! The name's Me-mow. If you let Jake die, so help me I will kill you too! Try it, oaf! Give me the antidote! Face me, cat! Ugh, ow! [shrieks, bent over the weakened Jake] Give it up, Me-mow! You're only making my face look cooler! You're at my mercy! Ha, you think you're hurting me? With that tiny dagger? We'll see who's laughing when you're blind! It's over! Give me the antidote! What, this antidote? [Me-mow breaks the antidote on the tree] No! You... milk-lapper! [ I'm coming-- [he starts crawling, but immediately puts his face to the ground] Forget it, kid. I gave Jake enough poison to kill a dog fifty times his size. Oh, no... [starts crying next to Jake] Wait! Oh yeah [Takes a deep breath and enlarges his liver to 51 times its normal size] Dog liver times fifty-one! A magic dog? Nooooooo!!!!!!! [Jake shrinks] How you feeling, dude? [singing like a rockstar] Big liver, big liver, yeah!! You've ruined me! I have to wait a whole year to retake the assassins test! Aww! What if I made you my royal pet? Oh, dear.... Nice defense mechanism, Wild B! Are you naked? Oh, no, this is a medical condition. I need a hospital [groans] Hehe, we all need a hospital. Jake...? Jake? [opens storage closet] Hey, man. Hey, dude. You still thinking about... Yeah. Yeah? Me, too. Princess Bubblegum's ready for us, so we should go. Okay. Just give me a few more months in here and I'll be ready. It's okay, man. Just—just play it off. Just make a—a normal face. [passes hand over face] See? Normal face. [passes hand over face] [he starts crying] [starts crying] Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming. We may begin the ceremony! Thanks for bringing us along on the trip, Preebs. Yeah. It's unfortunate we can't enjoy some of these cool things we're passing by, but I guess we could do that the next time we're in the Desert of Wonders, whenever that is! We're on a mission to collect samples only. I want to start colonizing this area by the end of the year. You are killing me, PB! James, give a readout on fuel. Right away, Princess. [makes whirring noises] Boop! Boop! Boop! Boop! Beet! We have a surplus of fuel, so after we collect samples, we may explore. Yeah! I'm glad James is on this trip. Hey, James, thumbs up, buddy! [returns the thumbs up while making robotic noises] Heh. Dude, James is kind of, uh, goofy. I wasn't gonna say anything, but yeah. Maybe when we get to know him better, it'll be charming. James, slow down. We're here. I'm registering mondo mega rads down there. I'll ready the radiation suits upon landing. Excellent. Take us down. Hold on to your sack lunch! [walking robotically] Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Okay. You guys collect as many surface samples as you can—rocks, plants, dirt, anything. Mostly looks like it's just dirt here. This'll be fun. [picks up a rock] Jake, open up the basket. I'm gonna make a shot! Do it! Chk-chk! Whoop! [throws rock] Ha ha! [rock hits his helmet] [growls quietly] Wah-wah! [lifts up a rock, revealing some green substance] Hmm. [pokes it with a stick] Aah! Ach! Brownstadt! Guys, run! James, speed up that sack lunch! [accelerates] Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Ugh! [starts up the engine] Ugh! Everyone okay? [pointing behind Finn] [stammering fearfully] Huh? [turns around, seeing lots of monsters climbing on the vehicle's windshield.] Oh, my garf! What are they?! Uh, they're toxic creatures from another time. [checking monitor] Okay, let's see—suspension's all donked, navigation's lost, and the ship's legs are kaput. We're dead in the water. [gasp] [makes whirring sound] Chk! Ah-oogah! Oh, yuck! Come on! Manners! [presses a button, engaging the blast doors] Gotta brain out the situation. Those goo monsters will barf their way through the hull in mere minutes. Finn, what should we do? [taken aback] Uh... let's radio for help. Good idea, but looks like the radio's kerplowed. [whirs] I can fix that radio. Mrow-row-row! Pling! [pulls out a coin] With this! It's a lucky coin! Bam! [places coin on radio] When I bust out my coin, great stuff happens, like when I was chosen to go on this mission with you guys! [giggles] Mnh. Mnh. James, that's not helping! Don't panic, baby. Yes. James is very resourceful. He'll work it out. [picks up coin] Vrrt! Veet! Vrrt! Vreet! Vrrt! Gzzzh! Jzzt! Bwr! [turns screw with coin] Look, Princess! I invented a coin-operated coin screwdrive-e-er! See what I mean? Good job, James. [gives thumbs up] Come on, guys. Let's take inventory of the emergency gear. [opens radio] Lucky coin strikes again! Hey, Preebos, I know things seem bad, but I'll figure out a plan. I know, Finn. Dude, I found us some flares! I saved us! Right on! Hey, dudes, the radio is fixed! Good Grod! I love you, James! I knew you could do it, James! You know, James, I wasn't sure about you at first, but you're okay. Thanks, Jake. I wasn't sure about you either. [clicks tongue] James, the radio's still not working! I'm not getting any signal. [opens radio] What the skunk?! James, it's all sanched up!  [to Finn] I take it back. [shape-shifts to look like a bird] This guy's totally cuckoo! This is my cuckoo face. He did his best, you guys. Right, right. Okay, time for plan B. James, pass me them flares. Chk-oo! Boop! A flare for m'liege. [opens flare box and sees that it is empty] James, where are the flares?! What?! May—maybe they're, uh, invisible flares. [growls in frustration] Finn, PB, can I speak to you in the other room, please?! You want to do this trust-huddle style, buddy? [nods] Hm. So what's all the hubbub? What's up with that James dude? Yeah. Do you think James could be breaking things on purpose? No. James wouldn't do that. Wake up. Dude's a saboteur. It's not James. What's not Hey, that gives me an idea. Me, too! Vrrt! [laughs] Just kidding! I don't have any ideas. Diversion. [pushes buttons] D-d-d-d-d-d-diversion! Time to set up a diversion. You see anything, brudda? [looking through binoculars] Ah, I got bunkus. Wait. If we jam up to that cliff face, I think we can climb—whoop. [sees monsters] More goo bros. What the—?! That won't hold them for long. It can't end like this. I got a lady and five kids! I thought I'd outlive at least one of them! Here, man. Take this. [offers coin] Your lucky coin? Yeah, man. It always keeps me calm. [accusingly] Who shot that flare, James? We don't have time to point fingers. [growls] You're right. There's only one way out of this jam. One of us has to eat the big one so the others can survive. And I'm gonna be that one. I'll run up there and get the creatures to chase me, and while they're busy noshing on my teen-boy body, you three can climb to safety. Don't try to talk me out of it. I got crystal certainty. This is what it means to be a he— Wha—? [knocks out Jake too] James. We need to talk. So, what do you say? Sure thing, Princess! [breaks off a corner of his head, hands it to Princess Bubblegum, salutes, and jumps down the hatch] Byong! Ugh! Huh? Why did—Jake? [grunts] Wh—where's James? [looks back at the ship] [wakes up] Aah! James, look out! Ohh. PB! What's going on? Finn, I need to explain something really heavy. I was the one who sabotaged all your escape plans. I calculated the chance of success for every possible escape plan, and none of them were going to work. You said it yourself there was only one way out. Someone was going to have to eat the big one to save the others. James did something really noble to save us. But I wanted to do it. Why didn't you let me? There's a reason. With this sample of James, I can clone a new one. He's candy, but you're not. I can't clone another you. Whoa. I made the best choice available. James served the Candy Kingdom on a dangerous mission, and even though he is gone and it's super sad, I would like to honor James... with this new James I whipped up in the lab! Jeet! Here you go, James—[pins on him a Medal of Valor] an award for bravery. Let's hear it for James! [claps] [cheering] Is this right or wrong? I can't tell. Hey, cool. Did I do something cool? Do I do something cool? I don't know, man. [walks up to James' clone] Here's your coin, James. Wow! This day keeps getting better and better! Ehh. [Sword drawn] Whoa whoa whoa. BMO, what's wrong? [Placing his hands on BMO's frame.] [Continues crying.] I think he broke his egg. Hey, it's okay BMO. Look, Jake and I will make you a funny face. [As [Stares at the two but begins to cry again. Finn and Jake sit down looking defeated.] Hey, BMO, this will cheer ya up! [He does a handstand and stretches his buttcheeks to enclose Finn's face.] [Muffled] What the?! [Muffled screaming] [Continues crying.] Well, I'm outta ideas. [Finn glares] What? [Whinnies] [Begins to laugh] Oh, man, James Baxter is so good, man. He always knows just what to say to cheer a guy up! Yeah, man. So good! Man, we should do it to! Do his thing and spread the good will! Yeah, man, I wanna be like James Baxter, always rollin' in on a beach ball, saying his name in a horse voice, making people smile. [sighs] Let's do it! [Laughs] Yeah! [Neighs] [Neighs] [Neighs] [Neighs] [Whispering] Sheesh, tough crowd. [Whispering] I think we should find an easier person to cheer up. It was a mistake to visit a funeral. [Nods] [Continue making loud noises and running after the girl.] [Heads toward an alleyway in tears. She realizes she's trapped.] [Stand in the alley's entrance and continue to make noises.] Eh, what do you want?! Please, I'm just a very sad girl! [Don't answer and instead continue to make loud noises. This causes the girl to scream again, so loudly that both cover their ears and back out of the alley.] That is so perfect! Yeah, man, so unique!  Man, what's he doing that we're not? We just gotta figure that out. No, it's like, he's shredding on a guitar and learning how to shred isn't just copying the exact notes as someone else's solo. You need to learn how to do your own solo. [Imitates guitar riff.] Why am I recording? You're documenting our creative flow in case we make a breakthrough. Dude, I think we do got something. Let's check the video. [Laughs] Bathtub, Bathtub! Alright, BMO, play the video. [Plays back the recording, then stops it.] Who's gonna scrub me? I'll scrub, [to Finn] you take notes. [Starts playing the recording again.] Yeah, right there, speed it up. [Adjust BMO's settings to speed up the video.] Slow it down. [Adjust BMO's settings to slow down the video.] [Takes notes and laughs.] [Laughs too.] Yeah, that sounds makes me feel happy! Good, good, happy is what we want. BMO, zoom in on my mouth [laughs causing BMO to laugh too.] Yeah, it's good, [stands up] but if we want to be "James Baxter" good, we gotta to go deeper. The Institute of So Und. [Yelling] Hey, hey man! [Turns towards Finn] I receive you. Welcome to the Sound Institute of So Und. Where is the studio to make the best feel-good sound? Just think happy thoughts and follow the beat of your heart. Hold up.... This way... [they continue, walking along the paths. [Gasp] Look at this tricked out studio! Half stacks! Full stacks! Oooh, distortion pedals! [Plays recording with close up of Jake's part, Finn plugs it to the amplifiers. The sound resonates throughout the room.] These sounds make feel-good, right here. [puts hand over his heart area] Right here. [ I feel it here, [Circles hands all over front.] good here! We know to figure out how to make our sound... [hands clipboard to Jake] force happiness into the listener! [Hands clipboard back to Finn.] Check our data? Maybe it should be higher? Yeah, maybe, maybe it could be lower, I don't know. [Points with a pencil] Let's both agree that that sound belongs there. [Steps back as Jake walks up.] See that sound? I drew that sound connected to two other sounds. [Steps back and stands next to Finn.] Hmm, something's missing. [He stares at the board, on which are pictures of James Baxter on his ball. The camera zooms in on the ball.] [Turn to one another and gasp loudly.] That's it, the missing thing in our thing! Yeah, James Baxter don't just got his catch phrase, he has his beach ball bizz! So we gotta create feel good body actions to go with our feel good sound! We just crushed it, homie. [Puts down clipboard] Dude, seriously, I think our thing is gonna change the world. When people experience it, it's going to make them so happy! [Also puts down clipboard] You're building it up too much. [yawns] Let's just do it. [Yawns] Yeah, man, yeah. [Points] Hey, there's the sad girl.  [Finn and Wha—[screams]. No no no, wait a sec! Reserve judgement until you've see the freshed-up version of our thing. [Face each other and nod. They start their act they criss-cross each other at the shoulder, Finn picks up Jake and guides him past both cheeks, Jake morphs into a trumpet and starts making imitating the sound of one. Jake then morphs into a ball and Finn stands on him. This causes the girl to laugh.] We did it! [They give each other a two-armed high five.] What's wrong? We're bummed. [Reading his paper nervously] The common rhinoceros beetle, scientific name, Xylotrupes ulysses. Common dung beetle—[Stops reading once Finn and Jake hop up on stage.] Oh my! [Out of breath] Oh good, you're still here! Hey, I know we were here yesterday [coughs] and we came off as inappropriate... [Jake cuts him off.] Let's just do the thing. Right, okay! [They start with the trumpet act and this causes the attendees to laugh. Suddenly the coffin shakes as [Wince as they watch it. Jake runs away with Finn calling after him.] Dude!! [ WHY HAVE YOU UPSET MY DEAL?! Jake, come on man, I need some help! [Pops out of the only flower present] Sorry, I act like a little kitty cat! Whoa, [licks arm] it's milk! [It attacks by taking out a large chunk of land by dragging its hand, Finn and Jake dodge. With Finn having to dodge again into Jake's arms.] [The ghost attempts another attack by body crushing them, it misses as they run away.] WHY?!! [It yells.] [Carrying Finn he runs and dodges another dragging arm attack.] Dang, this is real! [He stops as he sees another attack, but both are pounded into the ground with one punch.] [In pain] Eeeee, he broke my squishy bones! [Sees the ghost getting ready to punch them again and puts his arms up.] Don't worry, Jake, I'll block this one! [Still in pain] Finn, when we wake up in the 9th Dead World, promise me you'll listen for this sound [rhythmic clap.] What? It's just that there are a lot of dead people there, we might get separated. I'll be the one going [rhythmic clap.] [It goes to attack them with another punch but stops right above them as the whinnying of a horse is heard. It looks behind it to see a horse standing on a hill, James Baxter.] [Runs down the hill and arrives to the scene balancing on his ball and saying his name.] Holy cow! [Its fist softens and it instead grabs Finn and Jake and pulls them out of the hole and places them on the ground.] Hey, man, this guy really knows how to cheer a guy up! [James Baxter continues his act.] He's awesome, do you know this guy! [To Finn and Jake.] Well, sort of. Yeah, we know him!! [Chuckles] What's his deal? His name's James Baxter, he just travels around on his beach ball making people happy. [Rolls by again] Cool. Willy! Willy! Oh, Willy! Sh! There it is. The weeping Willy. [she puts a glass under Willy and pokes it with a stick so that it drops sap] One drop of its rare sap can flavor an entire stock pot of soup. [running] Danger, danger! Whoop whoop! Loose gravel! James? Look out princess! [while making her fall to the ground] Poot poot poot shooh! [upon touching the ground] Ow! [falling and screaming] [shouting] James! Remember me! [he reaches the river he was falling in] Oh, not this again. 3 months ago I'm registering mondo mega rads down there. [stuttering] Huh? [turns around, seeing lots of monsters climbing on the vehicle's windshield.] Oh, my garf! What are they?! They're toxic creatures, from another time. [scared] It can't end like this. [shouting] James! I wanted to do it. Why didn't you let me? Someone was going to have to eat the big one to save the others. And even though he is gone, and it's super sad, I would like to honor James… With this new James I whipped up in the lab! Jeet! Here you go, James— [pins on him a Medal of Valor] an award for bravery. Let's hear it for James! [claps] [cheering] Wow. James sacrificed his life for you again, PB. Yeah, that's like the twenty-fifth time, right? Yeah, obviously we'll have to re-clone him. Totes. Now hold up. This ground is perfectly solid. [ So what? Clone him up, girl. James is too reckless. I can't reward this kind of foolish behavior forever. It's time James takes his eternal nap. But it's James! Come P-Gum, don't be all cold-hearty! I'm putting my foot down. There will be no more Jameses. No... I'm sorry. Look, I need you guys to go to James's apartment and box up his stuff. [later, in the Candy Kingdom] And remember the time James saved PB from that contaminated cupcake? Yeah, he ate that whole cupcake. What a guy... [Upon entering James' apartment, he sees plenty of Jameses partying] Is this... James heaven? [shouting] Jameses! [all the Jameses stop dancing] Alright, who's in charge here? James... Uh, I'm James number 2. The original James got all goopy in the desert. Explain this biz, James II. Well... I was lonely! I knew Princess Bubs would make a new James if, you know, a James died a hero. So... You faked your own death? Yeah! I just wanted a friend. [ James... Plus, each time I get kerplonked, I get another shiny medal, and why have two medals if you can have all the medals? Medals, medals, medals... Dude, I've been to your funeral like twenty-five times. What? The medals make me happy. Plus, PLUS! It's a constant party here in [ [whispering to Finn] PB ain't gonna like this. Hmm hmm! Wait, don't tell her! I'll give you a medal. Nah, man. PB's no dummy. She'll find out. It's only a matter of time. We like you James but, you're on your own. We're gonna sit this one out. This should be good. There's Princess Bubblegum! [shouting] Hey! Stop running! You rascals, get back here! You are all in so much trouble! [shouting again] James! [laughs] What a show! Very enjoyable! [to the banana guards] Okay, who's the Banana Guard Leader for this week? I'm the leader. This picture should help you find the Jameses. Hey guys, it's the picture of one of the perpetrators. Take a good look. Ooooh! There's twenty-five of them. I need to see the other twenty-four pictures. Nope, you only need that one. What? How can one picture identify twenty-five perpetrators? It's because they all look the same. Oh okay, I see. There's twenty-five of them! They all look like this guy! Huh, how can twenty-five guys look like one guy? You mean they're viginti-quintuplets? You mean they're viginti-quintuplets? No! They're clones. What are clones? [sighs then speaks very fast] A group of organisms or cells produced asexually from one ancestor or stock, to which they are genetically identical. How did that happen? It's a long story. I love long stories. Aaah! There's no time! And they're not brothers? No! They're not brothers, they're clones! [shouting] Hey! Get down here and help me! [Finn and Jake indicate to her to go see them and she sighs] Viginti-quintuplets! I'm telling you... What are you doing? Why aren't you helping? Come on PBs, just sit here with us for five minutes. Why? Come on! Five minutes! Maybe just a brick. [to one of the Jameses who's walking in front of them] Hey you, stop! Yeah? Have you seen this guy? Hmm... [cluckles] I have to admit, it's fun to watch. [when seeing two other Jameses] You two stop too! [to the first James] Show them the picture! Alright. Have you guys seen this guy? Hmm... Let me see that picture again. [gives it to them] Here you go. Hmm... Hmm... [to Clone James I] What's your name? James. [pointing to a random James with their finger] What's your name? James. [when the Banana guard leader points to him] James. [when the Banana guard leader points to him] James. You're all named James. Is it because you guys look alike? I guess so. Y'know, I was telling this to the guys... If, if we look alike, we should have the same name. It would just make it a little easier. Life, that is. It would make our life a little easier. [crying] Aah... Give me a second... [wipes the tear] Same name... Look alike... You really look alike... Brothers! You're all brothers? No... I don't think so. [counting the Jameses] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven- Twenty-five. If you're counting how many of us look alike, there's twenty-five. Hmm... Twenty-five... Not brothers... [They remember Princess Bubblegum saying “No, they're not brothers, they're clones!” to them.] [to the other banana guards] I think these are the twenty-five that are not brothers. [shouting] Perpetrators! Get to them! [The banana guards start running after the Jameses and Princess Bubblegum, Finn and Jake laugh again.] [Four Jameses hide in a glove shop from four banana guards.] Where they'd go? [The four Jameses leave the shop wearing gloves but the gloves fall on the ground] It's them! Whoop whoop! Gotcha! Aww! [She, Finn and Jake walk to the Jameses]Okay, fun's over. You're not heroes! [rips off James II's medals] You don't deserve these medals. Wah, no fair. Evil presence detected! Evil! [A horde of goo monsters run towards the Candy Kingdom] Protect the kingdom! Okay! Weeoo weeoo weeoo weeoo... [starts advancing on the goo monsters. Gumball Guardians shoot lasers out of there eyes and obliterates one of the goo monsters. A Banana Guard fakes their death by putting a spear on his body and lies down] Ah! Can't fight! [Finn comes and takes the spear] Yoink! Hey! Heeyah![he attempts stabbing one of the goo monsters with a spear, but the spear melts on contact]Aww! Don't touch the monsters! They'll melt you![a Banana Guard tries to poke a goo monster, and run away after hearing Evil! [Goo monsters attempt to climb over the kingdom walls but are obliterated by Man, we do deserve them medals. It's not like she can give them to someone else. I wrote my name on all of them. Yeah, so did I. [Princess Bubblegum screams] Princess! [a goo monster is walking toward her, and she gasps] The original James? James are a heroes! See? [he jumps on the original James] Vrow-w-w-w! Yeah, I'm-a save the day! [he jumps on the monster too] I, as well! [he jumps on the monster too] For the good of the many! [he jumps on the monster too] Check out my selfless act! [he jumps on the monster too] Me, too! So selfless! [he jumps on the monster too] All for one, and one for James! [He jumps on the monster too. At this point, every James have jumped and turned into a pile of candy which then turned into a candy people made out of the Jameses.] Mother of Grob! We told you we were heroes! I hereby award thee...Jameses...These medals for bravery. Dat's my boi, Jameses! Now for your new assignment, Jameses. Go unto the Wastelands, and never come back. What-a-wha...? Do it, and I'll send you a medal every day. Yay! Come on, every-James! [chanting and running toward the Wastelands] Medals! Medals! Medals! Medals! Medals! [sighs] I'm not gonna miss him. Whoo-hoo-hoo! 안녕. ("Hello.") [Laughing] Hey bear dude, sorry to drop in like that. Oh, hey... brother. Whoa. Jermaine?! We must be dreaming at the same time again. Yeah. I was just hanging out with a couple of ladies outside... or a couple of the same lady. Then bam! Sky-boxed! Ugh. Jake, I'm here to work. I got to keep everything where it should be. So, uh... so how are you and Finn doing? Whoop! Ah! Uh... [muttering] Epsilon, eucradies, dernesto... [Sneezes] Jermaine? You okay, man? No, no, I'm--I'm fine. Everything's fine. Oh. [Muttering] epsilon, eucradies, dernesto... Hey, listen, um, maybe we should get together in the  awake world? You know, meet in meat-space? Uh, yeah. Sounds great. See you later. In the dream, Jermaine was wearing a bear suit. I wonder what that symbolizes. Maybe it means Jermaine needs us to visit. Workout time! You want the can or the cup? [Pours half the contents of the can into a mug.] I like the can. [He accepts it when Jake stretches his arm out to hand the can to him.] [Sips] Hmm. I'd hate it if my kids didn't ever see each other... [He frowns at a 'picture' of the puppies and one of Lady Rainicorn, made from his hand.] Or if Viola shoved I don't know. Jermaine's always been kind of a dream hole. Whoa. We're all getting older. We should go see him now, or we might regret it. Eh. It's not a great time just this minute. [He twists something on the device, and a green hologram appears.] Trying to figure this deal out. Woah! [Sips] Okay. Let's go see Jermaine. There's a lot more demons here than I remember. Huh. Yeah. The only constant is change, bro. I want my yo-yo! Yo, yo! That's rude, dude! Give me my cup! Huh? Bring me my cup, or I'll skull-cup you! Yipe! Jake! Woah! Oh, you guys really came. Quick, get behind the salt barrier! They can't cross the circle. It's made from Dad's old shaman-blessed, sage-infused salt. Return my cup! Return my cup--[Finn, off-screen, pokes the demon's face with his sword.] Stop poking me! [Laughs] Knock it off, guys. Just get in the house. You guys can chill here 'till morning, when the demons thin out a little. [Handsprings past Jermaine into the house.] Whoo! Oh, Finn--Oh no! Instant regret! Whoo! My house, my house! [Still chasing Finn,] Instant regret! Whoo! Remember, Jermaine? We did this when we wanted to make room for dessert! I don't care about that memory! What? Whoa--Ohh! Dang, my back. Come on! This ain't the treehouse, man! I got systems! Hey Jermaine, this thing is rad--Whoa! Okay, no more sleepover! Oh no! Don't--don't kick us out! Go do your Gaucho Marx slapstick with them goofballs in the woods. I got a responsibility to all this booty in here--Staves, medallions, cups, goblets, [the cups and goblets rattle,] dormant jinn, grimoires, hard-drives... All this random valuable booty, okay? Oh, shoot. I gotta run this beast. Open, ya sissy! Yeah, flip the tape, I know. "Good times." Right. Hey! I'm We've been friends, Booboo. You're slippin', Jerm. No I'm not. You're gonna miss that alarm one day, and I'm gonna eat you from the bottom up, [slams his face against the forcefield,] so you can watch me while I eat you. Then, in my triumph, I will retrieve the poster your dad stole from me. Bryce, I put the poster right there. [He indicates the poster, which is stuck to the wall at the edge of the forcefield.] You're still mad about that? How dare you use tacks on my poster! You're gonna get it, man! You know, Bryce, I would've let you and your poster go years ago if you'd stop it with all that "from the bottom up" talk. You would? Yeah, man! I don't want to flip that tape all day! That's you and Joshua beef 'cause you wouldn't stop breaking in for that poster. Well, come on man, let's be bros! No way, you psycho. I ain't never gonna trust you after all that stuff you said. [He turns and walks away.] I'm gonna taste that dog carne asada, you hear?! You're never gonna taste my carne asada, Bryce. [Puts his hands on Jermaine's shoulders.] Dude, you can't live like this! [Also puts his hands on Jermaine's shoulders.] Yeah, you got a plan B for Bryce, or what? I don't need a plan B. I'm responsible. You guys want fried rice or something? I can make fried rice. No, Jermaine, we'll make you fried rice. Okay, just don't break any more junk. That's our parents' valuable artifacts, you knuckleheads. I'm gonna white-knuckle you, Jermaine! You'll see! [They glance at each other, then laugh.] [Sighs] Whoo-hoo! I've never even made fried rice before! [To Finn] Get the plates. [Slides three plates into a row on the table.] Whoosh! [While pouring fried rice onto each of the plates,] Du-u-ump! [He then places what appears to be a carved-radish flower on each plate with each syllable,] Pre-sen-tation. [He hands Jermaine a knife and fork.] Good plating. Sorry I only have one chair. To brothers! [He raises his silverware in toast.] To brothers! [Finn and Jermaine follow suit.] It doesn't have to be weird, you guys! [Turns his head, then squints.] What's that sound? It sounds like howling. Let's eat! Dang, dude, this fried rice destroys. How'd you get all this flavor? Sesame oil and salt. Salt is one of the five taste sensations. [Counting them off on his fingers,] Sweet, sour, bitter, umami and salty. I guess I'm just used to bitter. [A beat.] That's weird. I haven't had salt in like five years. Hold on... Epsilon, eucradies, dernesto, quillduct... [He stops and puts a hand on Jake's shoulder.] Uh, where'd you get the salt from, Jake? I snooched a little from outside. Why? [Shrieks] Get my cup, Ariel! Please, dude! You get it! I need my DAT tapes. I can't fit through that hole Ariel! Aaaah! Got it! [To Jake,] That sword's too unweildy, man. But it'll look decent when I triple combo this bozo with this thing, right? Like how? Like this, bro! [Grunting] Aah! Oof! Boo, stupid! Where's my DAT tapes?! Epsilon, eudradies, epilindus... Oof! Why is this thing so dense? I got your tapes over here! Give me my ta--Oof! Aah! I got him! Hup! Sha-boom! Woah, watch it! Cut his arms, Finn! Okay! Woah! Wha--? Aaaaah! My cup, Jermaine! Oof! You're a pain, Jermaine! [Chanting] Jermaine the pain! Jermaine the pain! [Pumping his fists in the air,] Awesome, dude! We won! I didn't win! [He stomps up to poke a finger in Jake's face.] When do I win?! Special guys one and two win every day! Crackin' jokes, readin' foodie mags in your tree-town fun-house. Must be nice to be so special you can go off and find your own fancy ways! Meanwhile I gotta stay here and watch Dad's trashy booty 'cause I never stretched into the sky and farted on the wings of a falcon, I guess! Dude, I never farted on the wing of a falcon. [Snorts] Bros! Chill, Jermaine. [Uppercuts Jake on the chin.] Think I don't want a cushy tree-house life?! [Starts punching Jake repeatedly.] I don't even get salt! Saaalt! [Punching faster] Bark! Bark! Bark! [He pauses when his fist gets stuck in Jake's belly.] Huh? Yeowch! I'm sick of bein' Daddy's watchdog. [To Jake,] This must've been building up for a while. Woah! Wah! Hand fire. You got to be Dad's favorite! I got stuck with his mess! Come on. Dad didn't have a favorite. He just liked my fart jokes. I'm the fart joke! Shazbaz! [Looks around.] Uh, no. Shazbaz! Ow. Dad loved us both. [Jermaine punches him again.] You could've left any time. [Punching Jake again,] I know! If you punch me again I'm gonna fart. Oh man. I've really built my own cage. Guys, guys, guys! This whole place is burning down! So if you're done being angry bonkers, let's work together! Jermaine? You gonna leave me hanging, bro? Let it burn. Huh?! [Throws up his arms.] But all of Dad's stuff! No... I think it's all right. The salt line got broken. [He runs a finger across a gap in the grass.] Where'd all the d's go? [Lying back on the grass,] Maybe with all their stuff gone they had no reason to stay. Oh, no! The tape! Open...! I got my poster! Booboo Sousa... I ate his stupid face off! It was sick. Ugh. Do you even know what you sound like when you talk like that? I sound cool. If that's what you think. That's what I know. Dang. Has it always been so bright out here? Makes me wanna explode the sun and banish the Earth into darkness. See? You're doing it again! Birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday [chant a bit faster], birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, [Jake goes over to the cake and eats it whole] birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday! Yeah! Yay! Nice job, Mr. Birthday Boy. [with his mouth full] Thanks. Man, you are like another year older, but you look good. Like, super good. Yup. Mom and dad passed down some pretty good genes. Oh yeah, mom and dad. Hey, did mom and dad tell you any stories about when you were born? Yay! Birthday story time, please. [chuckles] Well, [camera goes down to his stomach, There, there, baby. You're going to be a fighter. [holds up a crossbow] Just like your mother. [shoots a bow at the door, sees that she got the right target] Yes! [gets on the floor] Barrel roll. [shoots and arrow at the ceiling] Ugh! [gets up, shoots an arrow to the right] [comes out of the kitchen with two plates with steak on them] Steak break. Let's get started. [sets her crossbow down, Joshua sets the plates on the table] These steaks are tough and stringy. Like you. Oh, good one, dear. [Joshua starts cutting her steak] Hey, after dinner, what do you say we check the ticker-type for new cases? Margaret, you're in a family way now. You should take a backseat from investigations. Oh, come on, Joshua. Even with this ankle-biter, I'm as quick as ever. Sure, my waist is bigger, but that just means more bullets in my ammo belt. You're missing the point, sugar. What if something bad happens? Let's say we're out on the beat, fighting some lowlife. He takes a punch, you zig when you should've zagged, and oops! Junior takes a knock to the noodle, comes out with the shiner the size of a grapefruit. I can't take that kind of guilt and neither can you. I can take care of myself just fine. And besides, these babies [taps her fork on her stomach] don't come cheap. We need to work together as a team to bring in the bread. [puts her fork in Joshua's mouth] [chews the steak from Margaret's fork] Yeah, you got me there. Now let's get over to that ticker-type and look for some perps. You relax, dear, I got it. [does a flip over the table, walks to the ticker-type and looks at it] Hmm. Let's get a look here. "Vampire girl spotted in the Grass Lands harassing sheep and cattle." Nope, nope, nope. "Small fire goblin burns down Candy Kingdom forest." Hey, that sounds fun. Let's do that. Wait, wait, here's one. " Woman's pies go missing in Bucolic Countryside where nothing ever happens." The perfect case for my pregnant wife! What? Now let's get an egg in our shoe and beat it. [shows them driving to Tree Trunks' house, they park their car and go to the door, Margaret knocks on it] [opens the door] Yes? Hello? [fixes his tie] Afternoon, Mrs. Tree Trunks. We're Oh, yes. A-a-a monster's been stealing my pies off of the windowsill. A monster, eh? Oh, yes, you can see the monster [Joshua and Margaret turn to the tracks] tracks leading off into the forest. Well, those tracks are as phony as a three dollar bill. The monster tracks are very real. [shows Wyatt climbing into the window with snow shoes on his feet and holding a pie pan] My husband told me so. [Wyatt grunts, and falls in the window onto the floor] Wyatt! Aw, aw geez. You got me. [him and Margaret step inside] What's the big idea, Wyatt? Why'd you burgle your wife's pie? Because it's amazing! Oh, I can't get enough of it. You could just ask for seconds. But I want thirds and fourths! I want to stop when I want to stop! Oh, Wyatt. [crying] Oh, it's the only good part of my day. Well, there you have it. The only monster here was this man's appetite for his wife's pie. Oh, no. But the monster is real. He snuck up and rubbed my elbow while I was gardening. And Leftenant Candy Corn said it came in through the window and touched him on the chest. Oh! Oh, now I got myself all scared. W-won't you check around to make sure no one is out there? Of course. Probably nothing more than a peeper. [they step out of the house] Ha! These country yokels are all just superstitious. I bet you that old elephant sees a monster a day. Joshua, look! [puts her paw in the track] Something way larger than Wyatt made them. These tracks look real. Hot cram! A peeping monster! Oh, this town would surely put up a collection to nab this guy. Oh, too bad you're preggo. We got to pass. [turns around and starts walking away] Come on, Joshua! [follows the tracks] What? [follows Margaret] Ha ha! Margaret! Margaret! Wait for Pappy! [a blue owl turns its head around, showing it has four eyes, the owl hoots] Hmm. The tracks end here. [a bush rustles, a blue cat comes out of it, I'll show that peepsie the pepper! [tries going through the hole, but can't, tries getting out of it] Joshua, dear, I'm stuck! [the creature growls and comes out from behind a bush behind Gads! [the monster screeches, Joshua! [grunts, gets herself out of the hole, the monster sniffs Joshua, opens its mouth and puts Joshua's head in its mouth, Uh, yeah, pretty much. Ah, good last meal. Okay, well, I got bit by a monster, a creature of the night. We both know what comes next for me. [picks up a sword and sets it on the table] Just make it snappy, darling. [tearing up] Don't. [sniffles] Don't be melodramatic, Joshua. [holding the Book of Poisons] I've been doing some research. Listen here. I think if we can get a sample of that creature's venom, we can use it to synthesize an antidote. [a thud noise is heard] Joshua?! [drops the book, goes to Joshua] Oh! Puddin' Pie! [groans] I'm fine. Just got to pop out and fetch that venom. You're about as fine as a canary in a cat mine! [goes and takes Joshua to a pull-out bed, lays him on it, goes to a candle on the wall and pulls it down, opening a hidden door to the weapon room, she goes in and grabs a crossbow and arrows, puts her belt on that reads "Top Dawg," goes and puts her hat on a mannequin head and grabs her other hat, the puppies in her womb move] Oof! Hey, where's the fire, kiddo? You stay put. [goes back to Joshua, who is asleep and mumbling, [walking through the forest] [through the walkie-talkie] Come in, Margaret. Do you read me? Over. [turns around, goes by a trail of green slime] I got the peep peep's trail. In pursuit. [shines her flashlight at trees] You have to say "over" or I think you're still talking. Over. [shining her flashlight at an old building that reads "Pantheon of Savings" ] Joshua, I've stumbled upon the beast's lair. [shows Joshua's walkie-talkie on the floor] Just hang on, Honey Bunny. Over. [Joshua steps on the walkie-talkie, breaking it, growling from the pain he feels in his head, lays on the table and breaks it, a blue bump starts to grow on his head, the bump throbs, Joshua howls like a wolf, scene goes back to [shifts its eyes left and right] Uh-huh. Oh, no! I must've scared the dickens out of you! [the monster sits on the floor and coos] There, there, baby. I'm so sorry...[they both tear up] For this! [punches the monster's face and puts a test tube under its mouth, making its venom go into the tube. Margaret, stay away. [turns around and points at the bump on his head] Something's about to happen! [the puppies move a lot] Something's about to happen with me too! [they both yelp] Margaret! [his throbbing bump stretches and makes a splat noise. Margaret drops the test tube (not that she'll be needing the venom now).] Shine the light, dear. [Margaret turns the flashlight on and aims it at his head with a recently burst mutant bump.] Yowzers! [Margaret shines the light at the ground, showing a puppy Jake, spawned out of Boy, Jake left a scar on my head the size of a nickel. I'll have to wear a hat now, Margaret. [takes a fedora out and puts it on Joshua] Well, I think you'll look good in one. [shows the puppies in the stroller, sleeping] Are you sure having him next to Jermaine is safe? We don't even know what he is. [Puppy Jake smacks his lips] Of course we do, dear. He's our boy. That he is. Yes, we've got one boy that I gave birth to and one boy that you gave birth to. Let's never tell him how it happened. Agreed. And so they never told me. Never told you what? I don't know. They never told me. Ha! My king... [Finn's POV is viewed as he opens his eyes.] My king? [Lovingly] ...Wake up, husband. [Small groan] What?? Long live the king! What... is... goin' on? [ Hm. Not much. [Whose bodies are upside-down now] Long live the king! Huh?!? Wowowowowowow... Hey... do I know you? [ [To Peppermint Butler] He doesn't know he's dreaming. Huh? [Dream shift] Huh?? Come on, honey. Eat your soup. ...Huh...? Wait, wait, wait... Mmm... hmm... What kind of—AAAH! How... did we get here? [Flame Princess now has three mouths and is muttering incomprehensibly.] Uh... I'm good on the soup. Huh? [The spoon is now King Worm.] You! You haven't much time, sir. What?? You are trapped in a dream. And you are in danger. [Finn scowls. Find the worm? But... you've got 'im right there! [Gasps] Satori! Huh? Huh? Huh? [ [Speaking English; incredibly deep voice] Hold down the tape until it fully sticks to the paper. Like this? Yes, but now try holding it higher. Like this? You need more tape. [Dispenses more tape out of her hole.] Use this. [Jake takes the tape and wraps it around the present.] Now, tape the bottom. Who's it for? Who's it for? .....It's for... um... Play this. [Taking viola] Uh... okay. The worm! [Another transparent Finn! Aw, man, is it really you? [Turns around] Jake? [Looks at mousehole] Yeah. I think so. [Feels himself] Yep. I'm trapped in this dream, and I can't wake up! Me, too! I was just in some other part of the dream with Princess Bubblegum and Flame Princess. Make-out dreams? Nice... What?! [Floats towards Jake] No, it wasn't like that! Hey, I won't judge. ...Lady's got two mouths... Mm-hmm. I don't think she's real. Weird... [He feels her "tape hole." Jake pinches him.] Ouch! What was that for? Just wanted to make sure you were real. Our dreams must be linked for some reason. Whoa... Well... Pep-but told me we gotta find that worm that crawled through that hole and break it. [Scratches head] [Speaking incredibly fast] In my dream— [Speaking normally] In my dream... suddenly, an unimaginably amazing sword appeared in front of me able to blast the hole open. [The sword appears.] Rad! [Laughs] I usually dream of messed-up stuff, like a shark tryina' bite off my face. Careful! If you grunk up the dreamscape with your subconscious fears, the whole thing'll blow apart! Ohhh. Just shrink down like me. And then I shrunk down like Jake. [Does so] How do you know so much about dreams and stuff? 'Cuz I sleep a lot. Heh heh. Oh, yeah. Fionna, Cake, I need your help! What?? What did you say?? I really did it this time! They're loose, and they're coming for us! Who? AAH! Dad?? Help us! Maybe he's not really... real. Dad, are you okay? That scarf looks... familiar... Yeah... Man! The worm is fast! Yeah, it's nuts! Fast as nuts. Well, let's catch it with... [ Well... that's kinda boring for me... 'cuz that's my normal power, you know? Then you get... birds! Ay ay ay ay ay! Remember, this is just a dream! Keep climbing! Now what? Break it! Jake, are you okay? Yeah. Are you? Yeah. I'm okay. We did it! Yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah! ...Hmm. [Noticing his reflection] Was that... was that mirror always like that? [They walk to the mirror.] I'm pretty sure this is not normal. [Now having a big human nose] Nope, it's fine. AAH! [A cup falls and shatters on the ground, then rises up un-shattered, repeatedly.] Jake, I think we're still dreaming! Nah, it's just dream residue. Forget about it. [His reflection floats away.] You sure know a lot about dream stuff... [Looks closer at him.] You pinched me earlier, but I never pinched you. [Calmly] Everything's normal. [Finn pinches him. It's still a dream. Hmmm... Huh?! Hey, guys... [Chuckles] Hey, guys! Why're you jankin' up my dreamscape!? [Calmly] Listen, don't worry about it. [In disbelief] WHAT?! You can't defeat me... I'm the king worm. I'm going to keep you in this dreamscape until I've consumed... all your... [Smaller version of himself appears in his mouth] ...Life energy! My life energy?! I use that! Aaagh! [ Ouch! Hey, guys! Hey, guys! Knock it off! Huh? Psst. If you grunk up the dreamscape with your subconscious fears, the whole thing'll blow apart! Hmm? Oh, yeah! Thanks, dream Jake! [Smashes him with a jug; the picture frame becomes many tiny Jakes. Wowowowowowowow... Okay, [Now shriveled up] [Coughs] Hey, why don't you sit down, or pass out or something? NEVER!!! Bubblegum! WAAA-HOOO! Finn, shush! I'm having coffee with the Lich. You wouldn't understand. You're too young. [Her cup of coffee suddenly explodes with the Lich's power.] SO MUCH SCREAMING!!! [To King Worm, who is now incredibly shriveled up] Had enough... destabilization? I don't... [Coughs] ...know what you're talking about... I'm a clown! Well, that's that. I don't feel so good. Yeah, mans. Actual Cool... [Pinching Jake] Pinch. Ow, man, come on! I'm just checkin'! ...Just checkin'. All right! Where is he?! Ice King?! Where is he?! Jake? He's right there. Man, Ice King, you better roll on. Where are you hiding him?! Who are you talking about? It's Gunter! He's gone missing! You in there, Goontz? Ice King, we didn't take Gunter. Come on, man, not the food. Daddy's here to save you, Goonty! What makes you think we took him? 'Cause it's obvious You took Gunter, because Gunter is like your Jake. Wait, what? Or maybe Gunter's like your Finn. The point is, you guys have always resented us for that fact, and that right there constitutes motive And conspiracy to harm my little road dog, Gunter! Hey, Jake, do you think you could, like, turn into a little Gunter and go over to him? That's gonna be kind of weird. Yeah, but it'll calm him down, so All right, all right, all right. Wenk, wenk. Aww, look at the little guy. You want to try telling us what happened? Okay, so, we were watching some young men's junior figure skating championships on the tube semi-finals. I went to the kitchen to fix us up something to eat. When I came back, he was gone. What do you think, Jake? Should we check out the ice kingdom for clues? Or we could get a real good night's sleep and start fresh and early in the morning. Wenk, wenk. 흑흑흑 안돼. 내가 왜 그랬을까? ("No, no, no. What did I do?") [Princess Bubblegum arrives at the base. 걔네들 찾았어요? ("Did you find them?") My GPS shows Finn and Jake over there [Points at the window where the Black Ice Cave is seen]. I think that's where the Ice King has them hostage. 걔네들 안전할까요? ("Will they be okay?") I'm sure the boys are fine. The Ice King isn't usually a serious threat. [Digs in bag] Besides, this'll be easy with the two of us. [Holds up robotic kettle and cup] We've got science on our side. Your tea is ready. [Bubblegum pours.] Pouring. Pouring. 제이크가 실종되기 전에 내가 월남국수 면이 질기다고 말했어요. 아, 내가 왜 그런 말을 했을까. 무슨 나쁜 일이 생겼으면 어떡해?! 걔가 만든 국수 맛없다고 한 게 우리의 마지막 대화였어요. ("I told him that his Vietnamese noodles were too tough before he went missing. Why did I say such a thing?! What if something bad happens to him?! The last conversation we had was that his noodles were tough!") It's okay, Lady. Jake knows you love him. 미안해요. 내가 국수를 너무 많이 먹었나 봐요. ("Sorry. I guess I've eaten too many noodles.") Don't worry. Just try to relax. [Lady lowers her head calmly.] I'll work on my holo-entry. [Recording herself] It's been three weeks since Finn and Jake disappeared while battling the Ice King. I've activated a secret GPS implanted in Finn's ear. It has lead us to an uncharted black ice cave... but I've spent hours calculating every possible danger and am well-prepared. 그놈이 칼을 들고 덤비면 어떡해요?! ("What if he attacks you with a knife?!") [Pulls out her Electrode Gun.] Then I'll pull out my Electrode gun. 그놈이 공주님을 해치려고 하면요?! ("What if he tries to hurt you?!") [Pulls out her Ball Blam Burglerber.] Then... I'll use my Ball Blam Burglerber! Lady, it'll be fine. [Raises fist.]  We've got science! 아.. 맞아요, 내가 좀 걱정이 심한 편이죠. 전 반 살은 시체들이 우리 집을 공격하는 악몽에 시달려요. 우리 삼촌, 외숙모, 사촌들이 다 집에 있었어요. 아기가 위층에서 우는 소리까지 생생히 들린다니까요. 내가 우리 가족들을 지킬 수만 있다면 — 그 꿈 꾸는 동안 얼마나 스트레스 받으면 이빨까지 무지하게 갈아요. [Grinds teeth] 다음날 일어나면 이빨들이 금 가있어요. 보통 전 그냥 그런 것 꿈이려니, 내가 걱정을 사서 하지 하며 잊어버리려고 해요. 제가 그 반 살은 시체들에게 정말 두 번이나 공격당했었잖아요. ("You're right. I worry too much sometimes. I always get haunted by this nightmare where zombies attack my house! My uncle, aunt-in-law, and cousins are all present in my house. I even hear the baby crying coming from the upstairs. If I could just protect my dear family. [Princess Bubblegum frowns.] I become too stressful during that dream. I even grind my own teeth! [Grinds teeth, then Princess Bubblegum gasps.] When I wake up in the morning, all my teeth are cracked up! I usually try to forget about it, thinking that it's just a dream or I'm being paranoid, but I was actually attacked by zombies before, twice!") Hmm. I suppose that's true. [Pours beverage out of cup] Let's roll. 으으, 잘 안 보이네. ("Ugh, it's hard to see.") Hold up, Lady. 뭐예요? ("What was that?") 으! 아아! 그만해! 도와줘요! ("Ah! Stop it! Help!") Don't worry, Lady! [Prepares gun] Ball Blam Burglerber-ber! [She fires a blast; the projectile explodes on the other side of the chamber. An arm pulls down Bubblegum's hood over her eyes.] My field of vision! [A tentacle takes her weapon; she gasps. Another takes her bag.] HEY!! Lady, phase through the wall! 공주님 무기들! ("Your weapons!") Come on. There's no turning back now. [Angry] This is total bunk! You copier! You're only in love with her because I'm in love with her! [Gravely] Ice King. (아이스 킹.) I've been playing this game a lot longer than you, pal! I've been workin' my moves, smooth-talkin' 'er, showin' 'er magic tricks! Don't ignore me! Come back! I'm picking up three heart signatures. Ice King must be talking to Finn and Jake. [The girls enter a giant air vent with a forked path.] Go to the right, Lady. 공주님 저 땀나게 만드시네요. ("You're making me sweat.") [They exit the passageway and find a large room with many closed eyes on all the walls.] 와, 이 방은 예쁜 새 소리에 대한 내 사랑보다 더 크네! ("Wow, this chamber is bigger than my love for pretty bird songs!") Ew. Lady! [Crawls towards Lady.] Lady, are you okay? 으, 네. 걱정 마세요. 저 완전, 완전 괜찮아요. 자, 가요. 일어납시다! [Falls down] 으, 안 되겠네. 혼자 가세요. 전 짐만 될 뿐이에요. ("Eh, yeah. Don't worry about me. I'm perfectly, perfectly fine. Let's go. Get up! [Falls down] Guh. I don't think I will make it anyway. You should just go alone. I'll just be a burden for you.") No, Lady. I won't leave you while you're hurt. Come on. [She grunts as she lifts up Lady. She carries her into a dark room.] What are you playing at, Ice King? [Pants heavily] Three heart signatures. ...Getting closer. Hey. [Dropping heart monitor] AH! Princess! What a pleasant surprise... Ricardio! Yes, it is I. Did you find my dungeon stimulating? [Angry] Where are Finn and Jake?! What do you see in those two? [Throwing the two in front of her.] A boy... and a dog. You deserve more mature companionship. [Gasps; to herself] Poisoned with Zanoits. You see, I thought I only wanted your heart, but I was wrong. I was unfair to you. I want the full package. [Princess Bubblegum looks appalled.] Princess... What...? I'm a man now. [Bubblegum repeatedly shrieks in utter horror.] I made myself this body for you, Princess, [The scene goes a flashback where [Feigning] It hurt, ooh, boy! How about a hug? Gimme a hug! I need it! [Ricardio steps on him.] Oh! Silence, Simon!  All for you, Princess! [He takes Lady away from her.] Now marvel at these powerful, articulate limbs! [He ties Lady in a knot.] Attached with supple and delicate sinews. [Gasps] AH! [In concern] LADY! Now, my darling, we can finally be united as man and wife. Okay, Ricardio. I'll do it. I'll be your wife. [Proceeds to take off coat.] Ah! Oh, my... How Valkyrian. Princess, you are absolu— [Princess Bubblegum punches him, while sweating and panting heavily.] I just wanted to impress you! [Waking up] Princess? PRINCESS! RICARDIO IS BACK, HE'S IN THE BLACK ICE CAVE, AND HE'S PEACOCKING HARDCORE! I know... and he poisoned you both with Zanoits, but I took care of it. What happened? How did we get here? Hey, Finn. [The princess reveals I made it out of Ricardio's sinews... and some toffee and maracas. Coochie coochie coochie! I'm glad you guys are up. Please make the Ice King leave. Hahaha! Shooka shooka shooka! [Laughs then claps.] ICE KING, PLEASE LEAVE!!! [Happily] Ah-hay!! How are you feeling, Lady? 제이크 깨어났어요? ("Is Jake awake?") Yes. He's awake. [With regret] Oh, Lady. I should have never put you in danger. [Gravely] I saw on the heart monitor. I didn't know. [Hugging Princess Bubblegum] 괜찮아요. 비밀로 한 제가 잘못이죠. ("It's fine. It was my fault for hiding it.") [Flies to the three] Jake! (제이크!) [Happy] Lady! Oh, Lady! ...I'M... PUPPIES!? Lady Rainicorn's house .] [in Korean with subtitles] TV, Its noon. Are you getting up? (TV, 벌써 열두시야. 안 일어날 거야?)

[thinking] This box looks vintage. [out loud] It could be worth money. [monotonally singing] Gonna sell a weird box. Gonna make some mad bucks. Gonna buy some new books. TV? TV? [pre-recorded message from computer] Hey, mom, I'm going to the market to sell a secret weird box. I ate the weird sandwich from the weird box. [echoing] I ate the weird sandwich from the weird box. I ate the weird sandwich from the weird box. I ate the weird sandwich from the weird box. TV! [yelling] Weird box for sale! Sorry, kid. Maybe if it was a music box. [in Korean with subtitles] Hmm. It's close. (흠, 가까이 있군.) Now, if it was a candy box, I could use it. [to the crystal] Do your thing. (찾아봐.) [advertising] Get you cukes, get your zukes. Get your handwoven tukes!

Yeah, no, I think I'll stay here in the Crystal Dimension for a while. I want to learn to be cool like you. More independent and everything. [patting his head] [waving] Love you, mom. [he sighs.] Being independent is awesome. Do you guys have any food? Hello! And keep away from Castle Lemongrab! How are you today? Mm, I see. Yes. I'm inside my fortified totalitarian city-state. Hello, I'm [from inside Lemongrab] Me too! Ow! Mm. Unacceptable. Things have never been better here at Castle I have never been fatter. And since the expulsion of Lemonhope... We have reached peak societal obediency. Law, order... Harp-smashing. We've have it all! Mm, the pleasure. Smash another! Ooh, who is this? [speaking for the Lemon Person] I'm one of my subjects! I'm being punished for helping Lemonhope. But that's okay! [turns him upside down and smiles similarly] Yes, morale has never been higher since we got rid of hope. In conclusion, no one needs to come here ever, especially Lemonhope, and I ate my brother. Goodbye! Save us, Lemonhope! You're our only lemon-ho—! Lights on. [The lights turn on.] Oh, Lemonhope, were you even paying attention? Mmmmmm, yes. [draws shades on his self portrait] I know this is a lot to take in, but one day, saving those lemons is going to be your responsibility. They're in trouble, and you need to work harder at this. Eh... [groans] I don't know. I'm not too worried about other people, I guess. Like, I got me, and they got them. Mm. O-kay... Let's try something else. [opens a drawer and takes out two cupcakes] These are cupcakes. Cup-cups! Lemonhope, [gives him both cupcakes] you have two cupcakes. Finn has no cupcakes. Lemonhope, will you give Finn one of your cupcakes? Um... [whispers] Yes. Oh... but I don't want to! I want both cupcakes. Finn can get his own cupcakes! [licks thumb and jabs it into both cupcakes] [sighs] Maybe we need something more hands-on. Hey, Finn, listen, that's it for class today. Whoop! [runs out] Whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop... [shouting after him] But read the next three chapters of your geometry text! Well, at least he's street-smart. [pats Lemonhope's hair] Okay, dude, we're going on a field-trip. This is the Lemon Earldom perimeter. Unfortunately, there are pacts and treaties preventing me from getting any closer. We should cloak. [hits a button on her and Lemonhope's wristbands, turning them invisible] I know you don't like thinking about Castle Lemongrab, but it's where your family is. They set you free, and now they're being punished for it. It rips. Look! Remember, Lemonhope! I'm going to eat you! I did it! D'ya see? They helped you. You have to help them now. It's your responsibility. No! I don't have to do anything that I don't want to. They set me free, and free means I decide what I do, not them and not you! Dude, I'm sorry, but that attitude is unacceptable—oh! I mean... [sees that Lemonhope left] Lemonhope? ♪ ♪My body's free like a li'l baby bird. Caw! Pick it up, you chumps!

[squeezes a dry slice of lime] Oh. I guess that's the rest of those. [throws it on a pile of dry slices] Well, I guess if there's no juice, I got freedom to go find water. [laughs weakly then frowns] Huh. Weird cloud's still there. [shakes fist] Couldn't rain a little, could ya? Huh, cloud? Eh, what are you gonna do? Freedom not to rain, I guess.

Who are you? My name's Mm-hmm. Kid, truth be told, you're looking a little raw. You're totally free to come hang out with me until you're feeling stronger. [unsure] Mm... It's your choice.

Hold that thought, buddy. Looks like a Greed Lard's picked up our scent. Dangit, he's a fast one. We can't outrun him, but maybe we can drive him off.

What? What for? STOP THE SHIP! You see, Lemonhope? It's not peeps. It's dosh! Oh. Greed Lards eat dosh for food, and 'cause we killed it, we get to keep it all. That's my job, Lemonhope. When I'm not out being free and having adventures, I'm killing monsters that eat dosh and then keeping the dosh. And it just so happens that I'm looking for a new apprentice.

The old three Rs, y'know what I'm saying? Ro-ro-romance. No, man, I can't wait for some love. It's been so lo— [drops bucket] whoops. Oh, drats. Oh, well. Hey, don't sweat it, buddy. It wasn't your fault. It's not that, Phlannel. I had a bad dream. Again? That's the third time this week. [sighs] I'm free now, Phlannel, to do all whatevs I ever wanted, but all I think about is my old life. What does it mean? Well, it's true you are free—free to help the Lemon People or leave them be—but a debt unpaid is not easily forgotten. So you are a prisoner still in deinem kopf(in your head). Huh. That's what Mistress always said, and I didn't even listen. Ah, Lemonhope, you're a doer, not a listener. You learn with your heart and hands, not your head. So... what will you do, Lemonhope? I'll... I'll go back, and I'll help my people, and maybe I'll feel better. [laughs] And how will you do it? Um... with my harp [takes out harp] and... my flute! [takes out flute] And help from my friend Phlannel! Nah, little Lemonhope. Of course, I'll take you as far as I can, but I can't interfere directly in Lemongrab politics. All those old pacts and treaties have me sklonked up tighter than a synthetic zanoit sterilizer bed compressor tube enlarger on garbage day. ♪ Hmm... [imagines picking a lock with his harp] Looking for something? [gasps] Well, you found me, fat Oh, what's that you've got? Ah-ha, your little harp? But what's this? [takes off hood, revealing corked ears] I've got things in my ears tonight! So now I'm invincible! [from inside Lemongrab] Play it, Lemonhope! What? I—speak up, child! I didn't say anything. The harp! Hurry! I'll take care of the rest! What? The harp, Lemonhope! Play it! Oh, the harp! Didn't I just explain? I've got things in my— [gasps] My—my—my things! [reaches inside him for [screams] Let—Let me go! Let me go! The harp, Lemonhope! The harp! [screaming] This sounds awful! Faster, Lemonhope! Faster, Lemonhope! I can't stands no more! Faster! [shaking his head violently] AAAAAAAAAAAAAH—! Hmm? Coming! [climbs up steps] Wait, I'm—I'm—I'm coming! Hello? H—Hello? You know, I was thinking, Lemonhope. Maybe you'd like to stay here in Lemongrab while Lemongrab recovers. Every kingdom needs a champion, and you're a true champion if ever I've seen one. Plus, I already set up a little room for you. Is he gonna stay like that? Like what? [looks at Lemongrab 3, lumpy and covered in stitches] Oh, heh, no, no-no-no-no. Once his brains and bodies remix, he should be back to his lonely old self, which seems to be his only stable relationship model. Me! So will you stay, Lemonhope, and help your people once more? Nah, that's okay. Oh, but I thought... I mean, you guys are cool and all, but I mostly came back here so I could stop thinking about y'all all the time. I'll be back when I'm tired of being free. [walking out] See you in a thousand years, I guess. Peace! Wow. I really thought he was gonna stay. Me too. I even wrote a song about it. [laughs] Hey! Don't laugh. Let me hear it! No! It's terrible. Come on! No! Come on! Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it... Gah! Okay, okay. Whoo, show me them legs! Shelby? [laughs] Hey, Dancing Bug! Uh, come on, man. Shake it. [chuckles] No. I really couldn't—Okay! Maybe I could! [dances, all cheer for him] Whoa, dang, DB. You're the best bug at this party! What? Hey, I got moves, too, guys. Yeah, right, Shelby. What are you gonna do? The Worm? [shifts eyes to the right] No. I'm gonna do parkour. Hmm. Haha! [jumps onto a box then onto a wooden pole] Parkour! [swings up to the ceiling, falls] Ah, oh no. I really hurt myself. [looks and sees that his tail got cut off] Guys, I'm so dumb! [lays back down] [sits up] Ugh. Hey, somebody forgot their—oh, cram! [ Pbht! Oh. There's-There's a note. "Hey, dude, the tip of your tail got snipped off, so now you have a little brother. We named him Butty Butterson. Signed, the other bugs." [Kent makes a pop noise] I'll call you Kent for short. Jake..Jake! [wakes up] Hmm? Whoa, Shelby! What's going on there? With your butt? It's fine. I was goofing off, got hurt. Now I got a little brother. I named him Kent. I'm Whoa! A talking brother. You can chop up a worm and get two? I thought that was a myth. Myth is a powerful force in my life, dude. So the thing is, I don't know beans about being a big brother. Can you give me some tips? Ah, it's easy. You just give him something sharp and get him to fight bad guys. That's it? Yeah, you might have to stretch all big if he gets in real trouble. But, yeah. Alright. Sounds good. Someday, you'll be [Shelby pushes a green plastic sword towards Hey, how'd you do that? I don't know. Hmm. Okay, Kent. This is real important. You're my little brother, so your purpose is to fight bad guys. So go fight some bad guys. Or girls. Don't discriminate. Oh. Okay, brother. [pops legs out and runs to a hole] Boo-oop. Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop! [looks at tail, grunts and ends up farting, sighs] Hyah! [a rat squeaks, Hi. Who are you? [Dewdrop laughs] Where am I? Why do my parts hurt? Oh, good, you're awake. I am [slurps the dewdrop] Pbht! The rat king has made his way to our end of the roots. You should be more careful. Oh. Oh, okay. What's a rat king? Oh. You're not from the roots. I'm from my brother's butt. Maybe. The rat king's been destroying our home, chewing up the roots of this tree. This tree that gives us life! Hey! So, he's a bad guy? So sick, nasty bad. That means I got to fight him. That's what my brother said to do! Where's my sword? Your sword was shattered to butts when I found you. Oh...bummer. Yes. Bums. What do I do? Um...I don't know. But the blacksmith could make you a new one, probably. That's who I am. And I am very good at me. Okay, so, like, the rat king has been messing up the roots, yeah? Chewing on them with his teeth. The sword has to be made with the strongest tree stuff so even his teeth can't break it! Bring me the freshest ingredients and I'll do it up. [shows Greetings. Hey, man. I'm looking for some unbreakable ore. Y'all got that here? I have what you seek. But consider this instead. [the crystals glow] I offer you this treasure of glittering emeralds. You'll be infinitely rich and live the rest of your days in comfort. No, I'm good. Just the ore, please. Oh, ho! Well done! By resisting the temptation of wealth, you have passed my test. Nah, I just don't care about money. My name's Alright. That's pretty weird, but...here you go. [pulls the unbreakable ore out of his cloak] The unbreakable ore. Uh...[grunts and pushes the ore halfway out] Uh..you can just—yeah. [Kent jumps and takes the ore] Oh, there, there she goes. Ha, ha! [scene shows Greetings. Come to fight me, eh? My name is Yes. I have what you seek. But consider this instead. [three female mice appear in a spotlight] I offer you the hand of one of my beautiful daughters. You'll become a good husband and live the rest of your days in true love. Nah, I don't care about being a good husband or wife or whatever. All's I care about is fighting bad guys. Dang, homes. That's cold. [spits into the dirt and picks it up] Here you go. Mystic earth. [appears] Greetings. Dude, you know why I'm here! Yeah. And I got what you want. But consider this instead. Hiya! [kicks a hole in the wall, white liquid pours out of it] Drink this sap, and you'll have life eternal. You'll never meet death and you'll outlast the world. Um...I was born earlier today, so I don't really get a sense of my own mortality. No, thank you. Hyah! [jumps, grabs a firefly in midair, and offers it to Kent] The sacred flame. Oh, what? [scenes go through her making the sword] [hold the sword up] I name this sword..Punch Party! [changes to Greetings. [turns around] Who's there? I am the rat king. [opens eyes] Why are you here? I-I've got, like, this rad sword, and...I'm gonna fight you with it. [runs to the rat king, jumps into his cloak and hits the rats] Yes! [fallen rats climb back into his cloak] Who are you fighting me for? Your brother? What? Instead, why don't you join me? I offer you cosmic power. You'll be a king and live the rest of your days as a god. You're messing up the tree, and I totally live here! You're a bad guy! [laughs] Yeah. [exclaims] [flying through the air] Don't do that! [lands on a pile of rats] How do you plan to defeat me? [hitting the rats with his sword] I'm...making...this...up...as I go! [jumps and hits the rat king in the teeth] Having a brother around looks kind of fun. [starts singing Little Brother] Where are you? Little Brother? Are you happy? [a transparent form of Kent shows on You were the first friend I ever had. No one can compare. Together we could probably fight a bear. [Kent peeks out of the hole] So if you're ever sad/lonely, don't be, 'cause I'll be [Kent hops out of the hole and hugs Shelby] right here next to you. 'Cause that's what big brothers are supposed to do. [song ends, Kent shows Shelby his bag] Whoa! [scene changes to Woo! woo! woo! I think the swimming hole's right around the corner! Yes! Woo! Woo! First one in the water is...um...first one in the water! No fair! I have to take off my stuff. [Laughs then falls down] Ah! Uh, eh, uh. [Finn laughs, rubs his short hair, and throws his clothes on the ground] [Laugh while swimming in a circle and splashing] [Pant while swimming in a circle] Faster, we're getting a swirl! You ready to get out? Yeah, dude. Let's get BMO to make us some sassages. Maybe with that one mustard? [Sassage Flare comes down Hopefully BMO sees that. Didn't Lady tell you not to use the Sassage Flare? Yeah. Well, don't abuse it man. 'Cause you're gettin'... I'm gettin' what? 'Cause you're gettin' fat. Wah! [throws hat] Whoa... [stops hat with foot] Hey. Relax. Grob, dude! You're hat's alive! [pets Finn's hat and laughs] This is crazy! [pets Finn's hat some more] He likes me! It's not my hat. It's, like, this other thing now. Yeah, man, hats can be anything pants, other people. It's fine! Yeah, but it's like, living now. Yeah, it's a miracle. Now he can listen to our rad jokes and hang out. Right. Maybe it's good he's alive. [kneels down to hat] You were a rad hat, and now you're a rad...little dude. Yo, bro! Our eyes are down here. C'mon little dude. Let's go live life! Yeah! Woo hoo! [notices footprints] Aaah!!! [seeing the food on the table] Aw yeah! Aw yeah! BMO! I did it up big time for you! Hope ya are hungry! Ha ha! You know it! BMO, this is Little Dude. Hello! Cribes! Oh, what? Ahh! There's hot grease next to us; don't fool around! Oh no! Get off of me! Little Dude, no! [pulls Little Dude off of BMO] You don't jump on heads. That junk is rude, Little Dude! You okay, BMO? I am fine, Finn. I just thought you kept better company. Sorry, BMO, he's just excited. Sorry, Little Dude, but I have to eat. [ Don't touch anything! I'm still frying up garnish! Okay. Yeah, okay. [takes some milk, pours it into a bowl, and he and Finn both dip a sassage in the milk, and then they both eat theirs] [feeling Finn's hair] Your head looks weird with short hair man, heh, heh, it feels like a peach. Hey, Little Dude, y'all can get in on this if you promise to be good. [mouth full] Only good babies get sassages. [knocks the fruit bowl off his back] Nyang! Hey, don't eat the—the food? [picks up a sassage and sniffs it] [retches] Dude, he turned it into poo! This is poo now—smell it! [sniffs twice] Yep. Little Dude! [trying to grab Little Dude] Quit it! [grabs him] Gotcha! Oh, little Deezy. What am I gonna do with you? You guys should get ready for bed. Yeah, okay. Oh! BMO hit ya on the butt. [laughs] [reaching for Finn's head] Nyang! Nyang! Shhhh. Little Dude, you gotta chill. [blows out candle] Night-night. [gets into bed with Little Dude] Nyang. Nyang. [Finn holds him down] Nyang. [fearfully] Nyang. Jake, wake up. Someone's on the house! Tsk, it's probably Ice King again, dude. Man, we should tell him we know he sleeps on the top of our house. [glass shatters offscreen] Oh. He-ah-ha. [licks Finn's hands] Ugh. [Little Dude escapes his grip] No, no, no! [gasps] No, not on my head! Poo buns! Poo buns on my head! WAAAAAH! N-Nyang. [picks up Little Dude] Gross. [gasps] [stretches Little Dude back to Finn's bed] [breathes raggedly] [in midair] Ninja. Eh? [in pain] Oooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! What are you doing in our house, homey? Please don't hurt me! You're in grave danger and it's all my fault! Wha? What are you talking about? Your hat accidentally touched my head flower. See? [touches a floorboard, bringing it to life] My magic imbues anything it touches with an evil spirit, one that craves destruction and chaos. Yech. [turns the floorboard back to normal] I buried myself so that nothing would touch my body ever again, but then this bloom grew out of my head. C'est la vie! Evil magic donks, homey. I'm sorry, that's just the way my magic works. [takes out a locket with pictures of his parents in it] Papa always said I was a bad wizard. Right, Papa?! "Baby's a bad wizard." A bad wizard, huh?! You're a bad wizard! [tosses locket aside] I'm a bad wizard! [cries] Whoa, cool it, man. Let's just fix Little Dude. [sniffs] Okay. Guys! Your stanky friend jumped out the window and ran toward the Candy Kingdom! Oh, hello. Aren't you a cutie! Hey, are you lost, tiny gentleman? Nyang! [jumps on the Candy Person's head] [muffled screams] Nyang, nyang! Nyang, nyang! [panting] Where is he?! [calling] Little Dude! Little Dude! [running out of alley] Nyaaaaaaang! [comes up to a horse in front of a saloon] [The horse blows a raspberry at him] Nyang? [punches the horse, knocking it over] [comes out of saloon] [imitates guns cocking] Nyang. [rips a streetlight out of the ground and prepares to throw it at the sheriff] Blisterin' beef! [happily] Nyang-nyang-nyang-nyang-nyang-nyang! No, Little Dude! Nyang? That's a bad Little Dude! [angrily] Nyang! Aaah, horsey! [laughing] Nyang, nyang, nyang... [continues] Little Dude! You were supposed to be my buddy! All my fault. All my fault! [straining as he tries to take Little Dude off of Cream Puff Gentleman] Oh, gleeble snoots! How is he so strong? Whomever the hat possesses gains the proportional strength of a hat! [horse neighs] Look out! He's got the horse again! Evil presence detected! [imitating a siren] Wee-oo-wee—[a garbage can hits him and knocks him on his back] Sorry, fellas. I don't thrive in conflict situations! Ow. [points at Cream Puff Gentleman] Evil. Nyang? [sees Gumball Guardian's head] [quietly] Nyang. No! Not the Gumball Guardian! Evil. [stretches over the tip of the Gumball Guardian's head] Nya-hang! Na-yang! [blows fire through its mouth] [to Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving] Dude, use your powers! I can't! All I can do is think about my papa and how much I disappoint him! Just think of something positive! Something comforting! Like... my mommy? When I came home with bad grades from wizard school, my mommy used to hug me, and hug me, [babbles like a baby] Ooh, Mommy! [giggles] Uh, yeah. Just think about your mom and use your magic. O-Okay, let's try this. [touches a tree and closes his eyes] I... love my mommy? Hugs. Aw, I-I'll hug you. I'll hug you. Hug me. [Makes a grotesque face] Ooooh, it worked! [runs through town with his arms outspread] I love my mommy! I love my mommy! Hi, friends! I love bein' alive! [touches a window and a pile of apples] Mommy! I'm a window and I'll hug you! Ditto about hugging y'all! Mommy! [slaps Cream Puff Gentleman's pants] Ha-ha! I feel like huggin' everybody! [touches a building] Hi, Mommy! [singsong] I'm going to hug you. Mommy. [touches Finn's pajamas and runs away laughing] Heh, somebody... get this guy some clothes! Now—now rise up, love buddies, [points to the Gumball Guardian] and hug your gross brother into submission! Gonna squeeze the heck out of him! I love that guy. [shooting laser] Nya-a-a-ang! [pulling Little Dude with the wheel] Come on, let's be pal-jamsas. P-Pal-jamas. Thank you, my newly conscious bros. Now return your life forces to me. I loved every minute! Yay! Not living! [angrily] Nyang, nyang. Ymmom! Huh? [feels muscles] Yes! [runs away] [picks up his hat] Poor Little Dude. He was just doin' it up the only way he knew how. It's not his fault he was created evil. Yeah. He deserves to come back good. Wizard, Mommy-magic this dude back to life. Okay! [touches hat] Mommy. Oh, my goodness! What is this lovely place? Life, man! I see. And this dude [points to Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving] is your pops. No, I-I, ooh—I guess I am. Huh. [hands hat to Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving] Be good to this dude. I will. Way better than my papa was to me. Yup, that's the idea. Jake, looks like I need a new hat. Okay. Let's go skin an evil bear.  If I hear another peep, there's gonna be trouble! Final warning. Okay, go ahead, BMO. Okay, welcome back to the program. We're talkin' with our special guest, Finn the Human. Hello. Now, Finn, before the break, you were sayin' somethin' interesting—that you're gettin' outta the romance biz. So, what happened? Well, I don't want to bore your listeners... But let's just say the time has come to stop dating princesses... and return to savin' 'em. And you're not just sayin' that to, uh—[someone knocks on the door several times] [ Yeah, of course. No games goin' on here. Hold on, hold on. [takes off headphones] What's that noise? I think someone's knocking at the door. Can you see who it is? Yes, Jake. So, it's goin' pretty good, huh? Yeah, but maybe we should stop talking about this "love" junk and get back to adventuring. Finn! Jake! I need your help; it's an emergency! [cries] Now we're talkin'! Don't cry, Slime Princess. We're at your service. I need Finn to marry me. I'm sorry, SP, but I've given up the dating scene. You don't understand. If I don't get a husband, I'll lose my kingdom. [pulls back shower curtain] I'll do it! What did I tell you?! Please let me explain. Recently, my much hotter younger sister, Blargetha, married a Slime rogue named Guillermo. As a result, Elder Plops decreed that if I was not married by tomorrow, rule of the Slime Kingdom would pass to my sister... ...which I'd be, like, totally fine with... Except, I recently discovered they are both evil. Evil to the core! They plan to militarize the kingdom and begin a campaign of aggressive conquest, [Tanks roll over the Hot Dog Kingdom.] sacking our neighboring kingdoms, [Slime People fill a sack with treasure.] stealing their resources, [Blargetha stands atop a Gumball Guardian] and eventually taking over the entire world! [The Gumball Guardians spray slime all over the Candy Kingdom.] Ew. Finn, this will happen unless someone marries me. No. [pulling back curtain slightly] Psst! [points to himself] Hmm! Please, Finn. I know I've crushed on you in the past, but I have no intention of locking this down. Our marriage will be in name only. Hmmm... [running after them] Wait, I'm coming, too! I'm gonna eat popcorn and make hilarious jokes. [empties the last kernel from his bag into his hand] Aw, who ate all my popcorn? [eating popcorn] You call this a room? There's not even a window. Oh, wait. Are we rolling? [munching popcorn] How much farther? This popcorn's not gonna last all day. [shrinks] Alright, now it might. We're here. [They have arrived at a bubbling cesspool of slime.] Welcome to my little oasis in the wasteland. Oasis? More like, "No way, sis!" [laughs] Huh? [gasps] [climbs into Finn's mouth] Whoa! This is amazing! You okay, buddy? You could say I got out of there [Finn lifts him out of his mouth with his tongue] in the "lick" of time. Zing! Quickly. We're already late. [leads them to a colorful building with dance music playing inside] This is the most important place in the kingdom. The royal palace? No, it's where me and all my main splurts hang out. Hi, girls! Hi! Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig, what are you doing here? Oh, we always come here when we want to shake it, Finn. It's the only triple cray-rated disco in all of Ooo. Get your face pretty, Finn. My people are already assembled in the courtyard. [walks onto balcony above a crowd of Slime People] [clears throat] Greetings, loyal slimejects! [cheer] I would like to introduce my new husband, [Finn enters] Finn the Human! [cheer] [to Finn] What did I tell you? Piece of cake. Attention, my loyal slimejects! [gasps] It's Blargetha. [A mustached Slime Person in a hat pops up beside her.] And that's the mysterious Guillermo. He hails from a faraway, much more somber Slime Kingdom where people have strange customs and no love in their eyes. Their discos aren't even rated one cray. My husband would like to say something. And, uh, he would, too, if not for his extremely sore throat. So I will say it for him. We challenge you to the Trials of Glarb. [gasp] I object! Ancient traditions such as the Trials of Glarb are no longer relevant in our modern self-indulgent society. [entering on a third balcony] Order, order! I demand order. I, Alright! ...the battleground of love. Aw. The couple that I deem most truly in love shall rule the Slime Kingdom for life. [taps scepter] Plops out. [exits balcony] [sighs] This is, like, the opposite of what you wanted. Welcome to the Trials of Glarb, hosted by me, I really want to hear some emotional song work here. The people want to hear emotional stuff. So let's see some stuff, alright? [claps thrice] Okay, Finn, you can do it. I don't know. I'm still jacked up over my lady biz. Well, just lose yourself in your own mind and go numb. Then let it all out. Eh. [exhales deeply] Okay. Just let it all out. [sings "I Just Can't Get Over You"] Why can't I get over you? Finn, way to go. I could tell the people were really impressed. Guillermo, you're up. Hmm? Okay, Guillermo. I'll ask, I'll ask. Uh, Guillermo still has a sore throat! Uh, may I sing on, uh, his behalf?  [clears throat] [sings tunelessly] ♪I want to touch your hand with my hand. I want to rub your cheek with my cheek. Maybe later we can get "Do not disturb."♪ I'm done! As Hooray! [growls] Whoo! Yes! Welcome, everyone, to our second trial... [The sheets are removed, revealing mattresses.] Spooning. When I say go, the big spoon will put his arm around the little spoon and cuddle. I will be watching you spoon, measuring and assessing your love by posture and overall vibe. The best cuddle, or spoon, wins. Wait, what?! [laughs] Spooners, get in your futons. Uh, I don't feel good about this. Ready, set... Spoon! [gasps] No, wait. I don't wanna do this. Wrap those gorgeous pythons around me! No! This feels weird! Come on, Finn, they're crushing us! [moving around on the mattress with Guillermo] Huh! Huh! Huh! Blargetha and Guillermo, very nice. Nooooooooooooooooo! Yeesh. Alright, everyone, stop. I've seen enough. Blargetha and Guillermo's love was way-off-the-charts good. They win. Yes! I love you, baby. You spoon so good! [pants] No! The score is tied. There's one more trial after Spooning and Crooning Smooching. I'm sorry it doesn't rhyme with Crooning and Spooning. We will begin our next trial on the morrow! [sighs] This is not going well. I'm sorry, Slime Princess. I'm just gonna mess this next trial up. Is it because you haven't done much kissing? You don't have to be embarrassed by your innocence. Pretending to be in love is making me sad. It makes me think about Flame Princess. What If I pretend to be your ex? That's worse, I think. Well, it looks like I'm losing my kingdom to the forces of evil. [sighs] No, Slime Princess. Let's practice this smooch. [picks up Slime Princess] [puckering] Mmmm. [groans and gags] [vomits] I'm sorry. I—I can't! [sets Slime Princess down] [groans] Bunk this. Wait! Where are you going? I'm going to punch Guillermo in his stupid face until he agrees to leave the kingdom. I want to come! Hey, Guillermo! Can you come out here for a... quick meeting? More like a quick beating! Hey-oh! He says "Eat a fat dollop and buzz off!" Blargetha! [jumps into room] Hyup! [looks around] Hmm. [gasps] Finn, you shouldn't break in to a woman's room. Hyah! Everyone okay? Yes. "Tank" you. Huah! [climbs in, finding Blargetha and Guillermo] Huh? Guillermo! [punches him, apparently killing him] Hyuh! [gasps] Are you dead, man? Aw, jeez, bro. [picks up one of his "eyes"] Huh? These are olives. Uh-oh. Blargetha, why would you make a fake husband? You're so hot. You don't know how hard it is to be this hot. Women don't want to talk to you, because they're intimidated, and guys don't want to talk to you, because they're too scared. You're alone in the hottest, most sexiest prison. So I stuck some olives in a glob of gelatin and called it my lover. Well, I'm sorry, Blargetha, but you're going to have to spend more time in your metaphorical prison in a real prison 'cause what you're doing is illegal. Uh, no, it just disqualifies her from challenging me. Whoops. [cheer] By the authority of [chanting] Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Finn, what do you think? I don't want to disappoint all these people. I'm sorry! I can't do it! [continues vomiting] Save me, Finn and Jake. Shoosh. Save me, Finn and Jake. [Harsh whispering] We are... Save me... Finn and Jake. Why does she keep saying that? I think she's traumatized, dude. Don't worry, princess. We're gonna get you out of here. [All three exit the castle by sliding down the castle's ice path on a sled.] Whoo-hoo! yeah! yeah! [Continues to sleep but soon wakes up.] Huh eh! What was that?! [Turns on lamp] Darling, are you alright? I thought I heard a— [Loud gasp. He flies over to the empty prison and touches its door.] Oh, I see what happened. She broke up with me! [Goes to the window to yell.] Well, it's your mistake, missy! This [Heavy sighing; moans] Why did she leave? I put so much cool stuff in her little prison! Come on, old boy, keep it together [Pouts] Hey, maybe she called me! [Picks up a pair of slacks and pulls out a banana from its pocket.] Please, please, please! Doo-doo... doo, doo-doo, doo-doo. No new messages?! [Angrily throws banana, which hits a picture of him and Engagement Ring Princess that has "Together Forever" printed on the frame.] Raaaaa! [Heavily sighs.] This is where she use to do her business. Uh, I'm so tired of looking at this face. [He picks up a razor and hums away as he shaves off his beard.] Aa, hee hee, not bad! And now for some healthy exercise! Ha ha, I'm forgetting about that silly old breakup already! [Walks through his beard remains and out of the castle.] [Finishes.] Alright, let's fly! [Jumps and spreads his arms and quickly falls.] Oof! You fool, you can't fly without your beard. [He mopes and sits in the middle of a sandbox.] I'm gonna be alone forever. [She enters the sandbox next to him.] Hi! Beautiful princess. Excuse me for approaching you, sir. You just seem so approachable. [Giggles.] [Chuckles.] That's funny, usually my looks put people off. [Giggles.] [Looks around the area.] Is someone paying you to do this? [Giggles harder and waves her arms.] Tell me about yourself. Well, there's not much to tell, really. I'm an ice king. Oooh, a nice King. Ha haha, no no, dear you misheard me. I'm not a nice king, I'm a— [Sees Slime Princess' eyes widen.] A really nice king! And I'm single! [Giggles loudly.] Oh my gosh! [Puts down binoculars and tosses away headset. She takes out her cellphone and also eats some chips.] Hmm, yeah, guess what, Slime Princess is in the park, and she's, like, talking to a new nice king and he's, like, totally single. [Looks through binoculars.] By the way... don't tell anybody! [Dials Wild Berry Princess.] There's a new king in town! [This soon expands out to show Wild Berry Princess calling another princess, who then calls another princess, and so on and so on.] Heh heh and I was all like "Leave him alone!" and he was like "Make me!" and I was like "Okay!" and then he was like "Aaah, my head!" Ah haha. [Looks up Jake's arm to see him holding a cellphone.] Dude, what are you doing? Trying to get a signal, it's like everyone in Ooo is on their phones or something. [Arm stretches back to body, [red hair] Have you guys... [black hair #2] seen the new... [blonde hair] nice king? Nice King? [blonde hair] Yeah! [red hair] He's single... [black hair #1] and he's ours! [blonde hair] Now, get out of our way! [She shoves Finn and Jake and rushes away.] [Brushing away the dirt from his clothing.] Man, now we have to kick that frog out of his new home. Nah, let him keep it. Hey, there's a new king and he's nice, we should offer our services! Finn & Yoo hoo! Nice King, Nice King over here! Ladies, I'll have time to meet you individually later, please just, just stop squirming. But this looks like a prison. Prison? Don't be ridiculous! It's a... waiting room! Stop squirming. [From a distance.] Nice King! Yeeeaah! [The leap dramatically and land in front of the dome.] Finn and Jake! You'll never take me alive! [His hands glow and blaze with magic.] [Both stare at one another.] Huh? [The Princesses have also stared in confusion.] You're the nice king, right? [Relaxes] Oh yeah, I keep forgetting that. Well, we will honor and serve you. Serve me? Yeah! We wanna be your nice knights. [Laughs evilly] Sounds... nice... [Bow down.] With my rod of niceness, I dub thee two my Nice Knights. [He taps both with a moss covered stick.] Yeeah! We're knights! Niiice... Who do you want us to nice knight against? Nice King, I love you! Did I tell you that I like the opera? But if you don't, I hate it! Nice King! [Angrily flares up.] Please! I'm trying to tell my Nice Knights something! [This causes everyone to gasp loudly.] [Chuckles nervously] Come here. [He huddles with Finn & Jake.] The main enemy to the Nice King right now is the disorganization of his love life. W-well, what do you mean? The ugly ones are all mixed up with the other ones! I need you to catalog them... or something. Tah ha, but we punch monsters. After I choose my bride, then you can go punch the monsters. Managing admirers? We'll give it a try... Let's move onto something easier. Um, do you like drums? Um, am I supposed to? She's dodging the question. [Faints] Are you fond of men with magical abilities? I'm really nervous right now... I-I just really want to meet a nice king. You can go back to the waiting room now, ma'am! I screwed it up, didn't I! [Cries and runs away.] I think we did a good job. I don't feel good making a princess cry, this is not how knights are suppose to act. Finn, knights are loyal to their king. I'm still not sure... Aa Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba! Loyalty to the King! [Pats Finn's shoulder.] Can't argue with that! [Calling from a top the sand castle window.] Hey, Nice Knights, Turtle Princess is about to walk out that door, I told her that I like her a lot, but I really don't like her all that much, could you guys break it off for me? The Nice King is not looking for a relationship right now. Get out of here! [Cries and runs away.] [Calls after her] He's just not ready for a relationship! Alright! We did it, dude! [Pats Finn's forehead.] [Sighs] I feel terrible, I need to talk to the Nice King about this. Yes, yes, keep walking in a circle. [Muffled laugh.] Nice King, may I speak with you for a moment? Princesses, I must speak with my knight in private. Go on back into your cage. Bye, Nice King. [Giggling] What's up, knight? I don't like treating princesses this way, I don't wanna... I don't wanna do this anymore. [Seething anger] Your loyalty is in question? Oh, it's not that. It's just, princesses are suppose to be treated with niceness. [Pinching at Finn's body] Are you implying that I'm not the nice king! Hey, what's wrong with you! [Laughs] Hey, I'm here. Ugh, Finn, get rid of her. What?! No, man! She's too loud and lumpy, I like smooth princesses... smoo-o-o-oth. [mimes curvy body shape with his hands.] I can be smooth! [Begins pulling at her lumps.] Finn, punch out my lumps. What?! I can be whatever he wants! I can change! I can't punch a princess! Gaah! Finn, just punch her! Let me see what she looks like... smoo-o-o-oth. Oooo... Yes! Hit me, hit me, hit me! [Raises his fist, but stops.] Uuh, I'm sorry, Lumpy Space Princess, I just can't punch you! Are you serious?! Fine, I'll do it myself. [Begins to punch down her lumps.] Princess no! Wait a minute Nice Knight, let's see what she can do. [As Lumpy Space Princess continues to punch herself, Finn covers his eyes.] There, how's that? Better? [Is now shaped like a ball.] Meh, no, I-I don't like her. This is all your fault, Finn! [Floats away.] Aaaaaah! King, I'm sorry, I just can't do this anymore punching princesses, breaking hearts, eh- it just doesn't seem nice at all. Hey! You're on thin ice Nice Knight! [A beard whisker sprouts from his cheek.] Huh? [Gasp] The jig is up! What jig? Ah, eh, heh heh, my jig is up. Up high! It's a highland jig. [Dances around trying to hid his face.] And I have a new assignment for you, one with more knight related stuff, very important. Oh, wow, awesome! What is it? The Wha?! Those are my orders! Yes, finally something knight-like! [Exiting the castle on Jake's back as he stretches through an opening.] Get ready, Ice King, for battle! [With palms glowing he manifest floating snow creatures.] And once I have my razor, I can select my elite army of wives and take over the world! Whoa, Jake, look at all his hair. Did this Ice King shave his back or something? Ha ha! [Gasps as he spots the razor.] The Nice King's razor [Clicks it on.], Jake, look, check this out- Aaaah! [He encounters Jake's face covered in a white beard.] Relax, dude, it's just me. [Clicks of razor.] Ha ha, you look just like the Ice King. [Covers face with beard hair.] And so do I. Heh hee heh. These whiskers would make anyone look like the Ice King. Ha haa, yeah, even the Nice King! [Gasp] The Nice King is the Ice King! Ugh, what do the princesses see in this face? Hope I can keep this going. So many princesses to meet. [Suddenly a whisker sprouts from his cheek.] Whiskers! [He pulls.] I can't be growing whiskers now! [More continue to sprout faster than he can pull them out.] Daaarrr, I haven't picked who I want to marry me! [Calling from outside.] Nice King! Did you retrieve my stole razor?! Yeah and also this! [ My beard! I-I-I mean what is that?! Pfft, he knows what it is! Let's get him Jake! [As they bot walk to the castle, they are stopped by Lumpy Space Princess, who is backed by the other Princesses.] Stop! We're not gonna let you beat up the Nice King. He's not the Nice King, he's the Ice King! We don't believe you! Man, these ladies really wanna get married. [Cringes] Jake, we can't beat up princesses! Relax dude [Stretches ear] just get behind my ear shield. [Plow through the princesses who are getting knocked to the side but not harmed. They enter the castle.] [Retreats to the top of the castle's room and runs towards window.] Wait, I can't fly! Let me help ya! [ [Dives after them.] [Reaches into his backpack and began to grab the hair.] N-no, wait! Yaaaaaaa! [Begins to glue on the hair] Now fly, ya liar! [He is caught by Jake] Ugh! [Hits the ground.] Oh, eh? [He turns to see a group of confused princesses.] Ladies, ladies, heh heh, I can shave it off again, a-and when you get fat, I'll grow it back! Eh! [He turns to run as the princesses start to chase him. They beat him up together.] Now that's what I call, a close shave! [Face palms.] Awww, haa haa hoo. [Pointing to screen] There. Right there. See? [Squinting] Uhhh...Yeah. It's a small thing? [Moves uncomfortably] Hey, do you have bigger chairs? [Glares] Stools. Huh? [Walking toward Jake] They're stools; not chairs. Well can I have a bigger stool, then? Jake, stop interrupting! Sorry. Enhance! [Push Finn and Jake while on the stools much closer to the TV] Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, whoa! Looks like a mushroom. Someone throwing mushrooms? Yes, very good, it is a mushroom! Or a toadstool. That's why you're sitting on stools. [simultaneously] Oh. See, you guys gotta trust me on this one, okay? I picked those stools for a reason. Trust my process! You can get up now. [get up and crack their backs] My legs. No, nobody's throwing mushrooms. [moves closer to the TV] I believe they're flying on their own. That's where you two come in. Okay, the flying mushroom came from that direction, [points in direction flying mushroom came from] so I want you two to head that way until you find one. A big one. and I want you to capture it, and bring it back. Why? Huh? Why? [leans toward Finn and Jake] Trust my process. Okay, but why, though? Yeah, we're curious. I wanna ride it around instead of walking. I think people will respect me more. [Dirt Beer Guy walks by in background] Hey. Hey, you, what's your name? I'm What would you think if you saw me on a giant flying mushroom? Dirt Beer Guy See? Don't fail on this one, boys. [threateningly] Don't you dare fail me. [Walking through forest with Jake] Actually, I'm kinda glad we're walking in this direction. We never walk in this direction. [Stops walking, faces Finn] Hey, how long do you think capturin' a flyin' mushroom takes? [Removing backpack] Well we gotta find one first. [Reaches in pack for something] Yeah, that too. How long? [Takes out water bottle, drains about a quarter of it, wipes mouth] Mm. An hour to capture, aaand, if we don't find him by dinner, we'll tell KOO to send out a Banana Guard patrol. Tell who? KOO. ...King Of Ooo? Yeah. [Laugh, continue to walk] Did you notice he was wearing Princess Bubblegum's clothes? Yeah, that was sorta cool. But you know, PB just left her kingdom to 'im. And all her stuff, so what's that about? Hmm. [Sniffs, stops, nose and mouth stretch out forward and sniffs for something, turns around] I smell mushrooms. [Run up a hill dotted with mushrooms] Yeah, good job, Jake. Check it out. [points to a relatively large mushroom] Big enough for KOO's tiny heiny! Yeah, the only thing, though, is it's not flying. Mmm, yeah... [Finn and I guess we could just sit here... and wait for it to fly? Come on, Marce. It'll only hurt for a second. That's nothing in the face of eternity. [shrieks] A second hurts really bad in the face of eternity. [Her fingers re-heal.] But only for a moment. Wait. I have an even better idea. [takes bottle out of pocket] Sunscreen. SPF 10... million. [empties contents and rubs it on hand] Hmm! I have exactly enough to reach my umbrella. [Laughs] Ha! [Laughing] [Humming] You really like chopping wood, huh? I'm not chopping wood. I made a toothpick from the ancient elm. See? Uh, knock, knock. What the dip, Marceline? Sorry. It was supposed to be a joke. Actually, I have something really serious to ask. I want you to do the procedure, the one we talked about. I'm sorry, but I don't think you'd make a good blonde. No, not that. I don't want to be a vampire anymore. [Gasps] Oh, my globness. You said you were working on a cure, right? [Sighs] Well, the machine is built and the serums are ready, but are you sure you want to do this? I'm sure. Some bad things happened to me when I was little. When I became a vampire, I was just a messed-up kid. Now it's 1,000 years later, and I'm still messed up. [Peppermint Butler nods] I don't want to spend eternity like this, with this emptiness. I want to grow up. Okay. Let's do this. This means someday you'll die. You know that, right? [Gulps] I guess that will be my last adventure. Marceline I'm so very, very, very excited to test my new lab out on you. Well, don't get all sentimental on me. Come on over here. You know I care about you. I think you're making the right choice. Your natural life spend is going to be richier and fuller than you can imagine. And someday, when you die, I'll be the one who puts you in the ground. But, you know, this operation might not even work. Whooooooooa! This tickles really bad! [Groans] Did it work? Well, I sucked all your vampire effluvium into this bucked. Possibly we won't know the results for a couple of days. In the meantime, you need to get plenty of rest. I'll check your vitals in the morning. Thanks, P. Brains. [Snoring] No! [Pop!] [Screaming] Huh? It's breakfast time for my sweet babies. [Gasps] Sweet babies! Operator! Put me through to Finn and Jake. It's an emergency. Victim's lost a lot of blood. Clean entry wounds. It's an expert job. Poor miss baby. She used to be my best cream cow. But now her milk is nonfat. And nanette, my beautiful calf is decaf! That's terrible! Every farm in our village was attacked. Not a goat or a cow or a duck left un-sucked. Well, I've heard enough. Come on, Finn. Let's go arrest Marceline. Wait a minute. We don't even know if Marceline did this. That's right. I forgot about Ooo's extensive vampire community. [Imitates buzzer] Come on! Yeah, but we need to conduct a proper investigation. I know that. Ain't no rookie. All right, come on. I'll let you be bad cop. I'm already bad cop. Okay, let's not pay seeds. Me and my partner will "interrogate" the suspect police-style. Meanwhile, you sharpen up your pitchforks mob-style. Yeah! Hey, man, that's not right. Marceline's our friend. Physical contact! Officer resisting arrest! Boom! Ow! Ohh, woof. Don't go ny-ny, Marci. I'm worried. For real? Why? Well, the process was experimental. Like, are there side effects? What happened in your sleep last night? Nobody on record has ever cured vampirism, unless you count killing vampires as curing. In that case, you've cured tons, right? "Tons" is an understatement. That Shnoz was nasty, nasty times. [Knock on door] Hey, cover up. The sun's hitting the door. I'm still undead? We don't know yet. So just chill. Oh, hey, guys. How you doing? Jake did excessive force on me. I'm sorry. [Smooches] Let me kiss it! [Smooching] [Laughs] Ew! Ew! Hurry up. Get in here. You done it this time, Marceline. You sucked the life out of defenseless animals! I ain't done nothing. You think I'm buying that boom-boom mountain? Oh, get some proof. You want proof? Look. [Crash!] Whoa! Proof of how off I'm gonna go if you don't confess. Yo, chill, Jake. I'm wilin' out! Listen, Marci, I can barely control this guy, and the villagers are getting crazy. They want to run you over with a wagon, and I'm offering you a way out. Hey, dillweeds, I just swept the place. Sorry. Finn, be real for a second. All right. Look into my eyes, man. I didn't do it. To be honest, it looks like you're not sure if you did it. Okay, I'm not sure! Something weird happened last night. I had a weird dream about stuff. Dream stuff always means something. We'll figure this out, Marci, together. We promise. Thanks, Finn. That's cool, you guys, but clean this mess, also, you bums. He's a gob-gleebin' vampire hugger! We got to tell the town! Book it, Terry! Run, Terry! Run! How long do we have to stay in the laundry house, cloud dance? Until Finn and Jake avert the threat. We can't afford to lose more livestock. We're struggling as is to keep our kids fed. Let's just stay in here until the dirty vampire gets what's coming to her. But I want to bop her in the nose! Hey, now, it's too dangerous, okay? A small town, we gotta stay close. Each of us play a vital role, and I can't afford losing any of you. Not you, Clubhouse Sandy, or you, Seed Man, or even you, Sandwich Paul. Sensei Paul. Let's leave the fighting to the fighters, okay, Paul? That hurts. You don't know I teach aikido. Finn's been turned! Wha?! He does the vampire's bidding. Well, there it is. Tonight we burn the beast Marceline. [Fat Villagers cheering] [Mooing] Woof. I can barely stand up. Look at this. It's my new dance. It's called "I got arthritis." Ohh. The end. You should have hung back with P.B. But I've got a bad feeling like you guys are gonna die without me. Dang, Marci. Have some faith. Geez. Guys, look. Moo! [Hissing] [Jake screams] Get it! [Both screaming] You see it? No. But what's that? Must be its filthy lair. [Jake Whimpers] What's wrong? Remember how I said my fear of vampires was based on ignorance? Yeah. Well, I think that revelation was actually based on true ignorance. So you're scared of vampires again? Yeah, man, don't be ignorant. Come on. Okay, but I'm gonna hold on to your shirt. Look at these poor babies. What's happening to them? Y-y-you tell me, m-man. Moo. I think they're in the process of being turned, eh? Ugh, glob. Something big just dropped in my gut. Hang in there, bro. I can't be here, man. It's too real. Wait, you hear that? Listen. [Sucking] There! [Groans] A little help. [Jake screaming and faints] Jake! [Grumbling] Hey, get back here! [Panting] Dang! Lost him! Marci? Hey, Marci, you still out here? She's still out here, all right. Oh, hey, man. Did you see a scary beast go by? I chased it out here, but it got away. Oh, we found that beast, and we took care of her real nice You vampire hugger! Wait, what? Lookum yonder. What the blood? [Groans] You dumb bumbags! [Finn gasps] Now look at the other yonder. Huh? Oh, fudge! You're sick, man! What's wrong with you? What? I'm the good guy here. You're gonna explode my friend. Blow her up! Blow her up! Oh, flip, you're right. This is way messed up. Run, Finn! You got to beat the sun! [Finn run scream] Go, Finn! Go! Aaaaaaah! Marceline, nooooo! Don't let anyone read my diaries. Burn them, Finn! They're embarrassi [screaming] Do you think it's right for Marceline to invite us to jam without Princess and BMO? It's just a jam sesh. Is that what you're gonna jam with? Yeah, man. Balloon music is the future. Listen. [He starts rubbing his balloon and demonstrates balloon music by rapping the Extremities Song.] Pretty good. [They continue walking and come up to Marceline's house.] I don't think you mastered it yet. Well, duh. I just started. Oh, dude. There's a note. What's it say? [Reading note on Marceline's door] "Hey, guys, I had to run out, but I'll be back," blee-bloo-blop, "Don't go in my house." That's it? Yeah. Just "Don't go in my house" in all caps... written in blood. Hmm. [ Eliminating desire from my heart. It helps pass the time. Come on! I can't do that! Let's play Cloud Hunt 'til she gets here. No, man, I got a mental block with Cloud Hunt! Yeah, that's what makes it awesome, 'cause I know I'll win. Oh, what?! Bring it on, brother! Now explain the rules 'cause I forget. Okay. I count to ten and you go hide somewhere. Then, I gotta try to find you. You can hide... anywhere in here. Anywhere in here, ...but Marcy's house is off limits because she said so. Okay? Got it. Okay. I'm gonna start counting. Ready? [Glances at Marceline's house] Yes. Go! One... [Jake runs towards Marceline's house.] Two... Three... Four... Five... Four... Cloud Hunt... GOTCHA! Huh. Hmm. [Checks under porch] AH-HA! [Finds nothing and goes on porch; spots Jake] JAKE! [Jake starts mirroring [sniffs] Smells like sourdough in here. She's gonna kill us. Once she finds out she's gonna tie us up and eat us like a spider. You don't think I know that?! Hmmmmmmm... We'll wait for the right moment and sneak out... right under her big, fat caboose. Okay, man. I can do this. [Begins pumping his fist] Egh! Egh! Egh!! Shh, here she comes! Here she comes... Shh, shh!! Huh. Let's get outta here. Hello? She didn't wash hands! Is someone here? [To Jake] Shh!! That's what stinks. [Finn and Jake look relieved.] Where are those dweebs? [Dials cell phone; it begins to ring.] This is Jake! And this is Finn! We're not home right now, so... [They laugh some more. Finn and Jake begin snickering in the closet.] ...leave a message! [Marceline notices sounds from her closet; Finn and Jake [in the closet] quiet down.] Leave a message! [Tone sounds.] Uh... Yeah, hey, you guys. Are you still coming over? It's jam time, so, like, call me, 'kay? Whatcha doin'? [Kneels down holding a piece of paper and a pencil] Get down. [Uses Jake's back as a writing platform. When Brilliant... but how's it gonna work? I'll fly the paper as an airplane down the bedroom ladder. It'll triple barrel roll past the kitchen, open the fridge, and cook some eggs, then eat the eggs, and unfold itself as it lays in the carpet in front of Marceline's door! Yeah, yeah, awesome, yeah!! No, nah, nuts! Welp... they're not gonna show up, then I'll just work on my own stuff, I guess. [Plays bass and activates recording equipment.] Take one for new concept album based on five hundred years of my journal entries. So here's some preliminary notes. [sighing] I... I wanna make this the most emotional album ever. So private and secret, that I'll never let anyone hear. [Whispering to Finn] This is so wrong. No one can ever hear it. Ever. Take one. [Making a hole in the wall with a spoon] We've crossed the line! I'm gettin' outta here, man! Yeah! Do it! What? What's it doing?! Shh, shh, shh!! Oh, what?! What happened?! Ugh! [She glares at the closet with a scowl, and the duo shrinks back. She hisses, and the duo scrambles around frantically. She opens the closet door.] Where are you?! Oh, there you are... My broom. [sighs] [muttering to herself] Stupid... thing— Get... [exasperated] NO! Stupid— [kicks the piece] UGH!! [exasperated noise] [She throws the broom in the closet and ends up dirtying herself.] Ugh! Is it safe? I dunno, man. Go scope the scene. What happened, man? [Talking quickly] I'm not goin' back out there. Well... whaddaya mean? What happened? [Finn stares blankly.] Bro? Is she awake? Why are you talking?! I'm wondering if she's awake. Well, if she's awake, she can definitely hear you talking! I'm whispering. Well, now we're both quietly screaming. [Awake] I can hear both of you. Disguise yourself, fool! What're you bozos doing in my lair? Dude, I think she sees us! What the—?! DUDE! You shape-changed to look like me?! [Throws the lampshade at Jake] Well, yeah! HEY! [Hissing] Exssssplain yourselves. [sighing] We were playing hide-and-seek in your closet and you came home, so we hid in there all day. We saw... everything. And, oh, Glob, I mean, whatever you do to us, I just wanna say, we're sorry. So sorry. [Not seeing anything wrong] Okay... apology accepted. What?! I hide in your house all the time. Anyways, no hard feelings, guys! See you soon! Marceline? [covers himself] Jake! Jake! Hmm? [He covers himself with a towel even though he was already wearing one. He goes to the bedroom.] Hey, man, did— AAAAAAH!! AAAAAAH!! Swordsmith Deity, from your unseen throne, bless this sword with your mighty hone! This new sword is guaranteed to defend you against Princess Bubblegum's heinous family. Uncle Gumbald! Aunt Lolly! Cousin Chicle! I like your swordsmith hat. Am I your special guest? No. Dang. This sword will serve you much better than your old, cursed Grass Sword. This sword is also cursed, but it has a compass in the hilt! Neat! Maloso vobiscum et cum spiritum! [gasps] Hunson Abadeer! Finn the Human! And Jake the Dog! Hey, did Marceline call me-? It is I who summoned you. I humbly ask you for an infusion of Nightosphere magic upon this sword. Okay. I proclaim this blade [Ow! Ow!] "The Night Sword"! Now to send you back. Not so fast. It's like I got a free flight here. I'm gonna go see my little girl. Back in the hole, Marceline's dad. I'll behave myself. No soul sucking, no evil stuff. I'm trying to be a better person. Maybe it's too late for me, but I'm trying. Oh, I'm so ashamed of the things I've done! [crying] Have some dignity, man! All right. You may leave the circle for one day. Wheeeeee! Ha-ha-ha-ha! Time to suck some souls! [sucking] Hey, what gives? Phantom manacles your wrists shall constrain until you're back in your hole again! Finn. Let's go see Marcy. Great sword making, Pep But. Yo, see you guys at the concert! [singing] Walkin' in ooo, not suckin' out souls Walk, walk, walk, not suck, suck, suck Walk, walk, walk, not suck, suck, suck. Hey, could you stop saying that, please? So what's my little monster up to these days? Is she still all goody-goody? Still half-vampire? Started dating anyone? Yes, yes, but no, then yes again, and maybe? Look, maybe cool it with the prying around Marceline. Nah, she loves it when I pry. [chuckles] Oh, [whistling "SHAVE AND A HAIRCUT"] You know, now that we're here, I'm having second thoughts. It just seems like no matter what I do, I always tick that girl off. [crashes through Marceline's newly-made bunker] Marceline! Long time no see. Some googoo with glasses summoned me. What's that thing? Just gonna put this here, okay? Now let's go suck some souls! [present day] I don't know what it is. [Finn and [clears throat] Psst-psst [points to Marceline, who is staring at Hunson through the window]. Dad, what are you doing here? I'm in town for the week, and I don't really have a place to stay, dot, dot, dot. Mnh. How many souls did he suck on his way here? Oh, I guess like zero. But- See! I made Finn a cool, new sword and everything! I guess you can crash here. That is not what's happening. We're gonna jet, Marcy. What?! You just got here. Invite them in, Marceline. Do you have a bathroom? Yeah, there's one upstairs. I just have to freshen up. Is my dad really behaving himself this time? He's just been singing songs and stuff. Yeah, he seems pretty fun for an old guy. Hey, wait a minute... I'm an old guy! Hey, excuse my unsociableness. There's just one thing; The Venetian blinds in your bathroom kind of jumped out at me and got broken. How could you wreck the blinds just by going to the bathroom? Let me make it up to you. I've got some soy sauce and some ketchup. I'm good. Here's an SD card, some twist ties. I don't want any of this junk! Hey! I'm gonna need a place to sleep tonight. Do you have an air mattress? Yeah. Great! You can sleep on the air mattress, and I'll sleep on your bed. It's in the closet. Finn, are you gonna let my little girl blow up that air mattress? Not on my watch! Hey, Dad, I think I'm gonna go out for a walk before bedtime. But, Marcy don't you have a solo gig tonight? Ss-ss-ss-ss! I get it. It's air mattress talk. Ss-ss-ss-ss. Aren't you giving a concert tonight? Ss-ss-ss. At the Ghost Amphitheater? Ss-ss-ss. Concert? It's a good thing your friends remembered that. Let's go! [sighs] [chuckling] Do you hear, like, a really stupid-sounding laugh? Yes. I have a nice laugh. Time to blend in completely unnoticed. [He phases into a ghost disguise] [gasps] Hey, what you got there? Peanuts? Hello, Hamburger Hills Cemetery! Marceline! You're doing great, baby! I haven't started yet.[sings Slow Dance With You] Hey, Pennebaker! No illegal recording unless you're family. Yoink. [whispering] Just ignore me. Dad! You're wrecking the show! This is my daughter! I am proud of my punk daughter! I made that! Sit down, man! Yeah, you're killing the vibe. I'm just explaining my part in all this. Ugh. This is terrible. Boo, I say. Yeah! Boooo! Don't worry, honey. I'll work the crowd. Hey, it's me Can you believe Marceline has a bougie trash daddy? I heard this guy even eats ghosts, you know, like us. What? Really?! Sure, sometimes. Off the stage, skin sack! Okay, okay, settle down, pal. Don't make me come out there. What you gonna do "eat my fries?" [gasps] My bass! Come on, ectoplasm comes right off. [goes to lick it off] Don't! You wreck everything. Mad daddy! Hammer fist strike! Let's get him, fellas. Ha-ha! Dad, quit clowning. Uh, just havin' a little fun.[tries to turn his hand into a claw, but is restrained by the hnadcuffs] Come on, Dad, fight back! He can't. Pep Buts bound his powers. What?! They sassed you. Better pop that cork, Peps. All right. All right. Chicle! Oh, whoops, was that bad? [laughs, and becomes invisible] Vampires can't hurt ghosts, stupid. [the ghosts fully trap the two of them in their tentacle-like arms] Shoot.  Wha?! [morphs into a bat monster and flies them away] Good night, Hamburger Hills! There will be no encore. My gracious. I'm so sorry you had to deal with Cousin Chicle's schemes. My family's out of control. It's fine. My cool daughter took care of it. And guess what I got from a vendor. [pulls out a big shirt with Marcline's face on it] It looks too big to me. But they said that's the style now with punk rockers. Thanks for standing up for me tonight. I'm bad, but I'm no so bad, right? So when are you gonna have some kids? Dad! Mm-hmm. Six and 19... One vampire—[stomps on orb and blows a raspberry], two vampire—[stomps on orb and blows a raspberry]. Jake, check me out—I'm a self-sufficient mountain man. [eats orb] No! [slaps orb out of Finn's mouth] Don't put that biz in your mouth, man! They could be booby-trapped or poisoned or— Whoa, chill, Jake. These pearls were dropped by The Moon. Her main power is accelerated healing. It'll be like fighting a cutting board. Hmm. Okay. Anyways, we should try to find her before—[Finn pushes a pearl against [laughs] See, Marcy? Isn't vampire hunting better with friends? Yeah, I guess. I'm just glad Simon is okay. Anyway... [dusts himself off] I don't care how easy this vamp's supposed to be. We should hole up somewhere before the sun goes down—It's down. Great. Yup. Let's get going. [uses Geiger counter] My vampire thingy is indicating high levels of vampire junk in... [points] this direction. Come on! Ha-ha! Stop, please! Don't be such a nerd, Crunchy. [draws back cotton-tipped arrow] Hunting is the most royal of sports. The people expect it of their princess-king. I don't think that's tr— [arrow hits him] Ow! [runs away] Aah! [clicks tongue] After him, Haydancy! Come on, Crunchy, it's dark. Let me tie you up. Aha! Good growling, Crunchy. All right, that's a bit much. Whoa, girl! Oof! Ugh! Oh, no stop! Shush up! Huh? Oh! It's it's okay. Animals can't climb trees. That's what separates us from them. Ha! Dumb, lowly animals. No! No, no, no, no, no! Marceline Where is she? Oh, boy! I-I wish I knew! No love lost there, am I right? Tell me everything. Okay, okay! I grew up poor dirt poor.

I'm out of the house! Come back! Come back! Back, back, back, back! He's not coming back. [PB a vamp is runin 2wards U] [Im sorry my bad] [-\_("3)_/-] [good X] Yo, guys? Pep says we got an incoming vamp. What?! Is it "The Moon"? Doubt it. She's more of a hide-and-seek type. So what's the plan for this chump? Given that he can see in the dark probably and could come from anywhere at any time and suck the flesh off our bones! They could ambush us like right n Ahh! I feel refreshed! Are y'all hunting wabbits? Man! I can't believe they just Left me here. All unarmed and tethered like this. Boy, my neck sure is hot. This baby needs to get some air. Let's do it. Back off!

How about this? Use one of these stakes! L.S.P., stop! Finn, I got one! Oof! What?! Finn! What is with all this tacky plastic rubbish?! We'll never let you get to her! Oh! You dunderheads! I can't even deal with all this modern nonsense! The rest of you, beat it! My blood, man! I love my blood. [PS vamp plays by old timey rulez, cant enter house etc. HTH] Get in me! Ohh! May I come in? Nop. Grr! "Grr"? Let me in! Not gonna happen, man! Eek! What sort of creature are you? Uh, I'm a magic dog with magic blood! I've got gallons and gallons of warm red teenage blood, and you can't have it! Pbht! Eh, yeah? Yeah! Open up a murder-hole, buddy! Oh! Marceline, listen to me. You will never defeat The Vampire King. You can't even defeat me in your current state. All right. What do you want? The truth is, I hate the king as much as you do. He's a total dink. I came looking for you because I want to team up. Then you started tempting me with boy blood Hey. and hurling spiky purple gobs at me. Here's the dope You need me. Yeah, okay, girl, you got this. I don't know how it finally happened, but he must have let you beat him. Am I right? Ugh! All right, say we do work together. You need to give up drinking blood. I'm a vampire! Drinking blood is kind of the main thing. And you can drink red just as easy. Hmm. No hurting poor, scared, blood-filled animals. Well, then, I suppose I have no choice. I'm just going to waste you And eat that kid, because that's what an old-school vampire does! I don't want to play anymore! No! I wasn't invited! No! Geez. What happened? Dude was too old fashioned for his own good. He just couldn't get with the times. Y'all see that? I killed a vampire. Aah, great! My plan worked! Ugh. I don't feel so hot. Bye-bye! Marceline! Oh, no. Uh, guys, I'm not feeling that great eith Ugh! You guys sure you want another round of squid ink? [Laughs] [The camera pans to show many marauders rough-housing in pairs. Then it shows Finn and the Not too bad!? I'm better than that! [Hears Mountain Man crying] [Pauses]Huh? [Throws the Head Marauder out of the way] Jake! Do you hear that? [He is riding a bucking half-stag half-marauder] What'd you say? Whoa! [Gets tossed and then kicked over to Finn] I think someone's crying. [The Head Marauder jumps Get back here you chickeeeen! Ohhhhhhhh! [Backing up the Head Marauder] [Turns around] What did you call me? You can't just walk away from a roughhouse! [Jumps on top of a table] Hey! Listen up you cold-hearted marauders! Someone's out there crying for help and I'm not gonna ignore that! Awwww here it comes! Lay it down Finn! A long time ago when I was a baby, I went boom boom on a leaf. Boom! Boom! [Flash back shows baby [The Head Marauder starts to clap and the others follow] He still cries when he poops. Thanks for being cool guys. Wait up, Finn! [Boulders are rolling down the mountains Mountain Man is crying] It's comin' from up there! Someone must be caught in that avalanche! Let's get it on! [ I am. Whoa! Aww, what's wrong fella? You cryin' boulders? Yes, I am sad. Having been forced to watch roughhousing men for centuries. Ohhhh! I see. You're feeling left out and you wanna roughhouse too! Well I can take you on tough guy! Come on Jake! Back me up! [Starts punch the mountain] Yeah, do it Finn! Hit 'im with a boulder! And then hit 'im with another rock! Please! No roughhousing! It…m-makes…me…soooo.. SAD! [Boulders are launched from his eyes] Huh? Why? Because they're so rough on each other! [With a slight stutter] But a smooth well controlled roughhouse bolsters your guts and rejuvenate the muscle. No! It's raunchy and maddening! All those men and their disgusting fantastic bodies! Whoa. This guy's got problems. [gasp] [Flashback starts.] Look mommy! [Points at Finn] Honey! Don't look! That kid's got problems! [Walks away as in the first flashback and Baby Finn cries badly. Flashback ends] I'll help you mountain! Whoa! What? I'll stop those roughhousers from being rough! Really? You'd do that for me? Yes sir! My name's But Finn, we're not gonna shut down the roughhouse for real are we? No way! But there's got to be some kind of solution. I’ll figure this out Mountain Man! [Jumps off Mountain Man] Yup! Aw! Finn! Ready to get destroyed? N-nooo! Wait, um, actually, could you guys stop being so rough? What!? [One marauder hits his head on a table] Whoa whoa whoa! [Waves off other marauders] What are you talking about Finn? Could you guy just tone down the roughhousing a little? What!? [Hits head on table again] Whoa! Hey, hey. Shh. It's all right fellas. Finn, I'm sure this tone down the roughing thing has something to do with your boom boom, and I can respect that, but how can we POSSIBLY, make roughhousing, less rough?! [Sees a duck and rat to the side] I think I have a perfect idea! [ [Head That’s like math. [While fist bumping Finn] Mathematical. [On top of Mountain Man] What do ya think? Fixed all youe problems right? No! That was terrible! Now they’re just punching animals! It’s worse than before and it’s in no way a good solution! I’m sorry! Well you should be! It’s not fair to those animals and it’s not fair to me! I might just start to cry again, you know? [Starts to cry again] Aw, man. Come on Jake. I gotta give this another shot! Finn this guy seems like a real nut job. You know what I mean? I don’t wanna get sucked into this guy’s hang-ups. Yes I do Jake. That’s what I vowed! To help anyone in need! No matter how small their problem! [Boom Boom] At least I have to try brother. [Jumps of Mountain Man with Finn] So be it brother. Hey guys. I’m back. [Marauders are roughhousing and ignore him] Hey guys. Guys? Men! Men. Please stop a second. Men! Boys? Please? I have more to ask of you! Bros? My bros? [Pets marauder] Brother? What? Did you just pet me? I’ll pet you! Pet pet! Heeeey! Pet pet. Hey this is great! [Pets other marauder] Hey! Did you just pet me?! Yeah! I did! Well I’ll pet you back! Wha-whoa. What the-? This is awesome! [Starts to pet each other] Alright! This could be it! [ Finn! [Laughs] You're really mixin' things up in the best of ways today! [Being petted by animals] Maybe you can solve everyone's problems. Like a cherub with its bottom out. [Laughs] Okay, cool. Hey, I'm gonna go tell the mountain. Alright I’m gonna- [sighs] stay here this time. [Mountain Man laughs] So, everything's fine this time, right? Yes! Thank you Finn! [back in the village] So the mountain is totally fine with everyone petting. I feel great. Right on man! The marauders are going crazy over the petting! They're petting each other raw! Check ‘em out! [The marauders look un happy whilst petting each other] They look kinda rashy. Hey Finn! Hey man. As you can see the petting got sorta out of hand. [Marauders pets him and he smacks his hand away] Stop that! We are done with that! We’re going back to roughhousing! No wait fellas! The mountain doesn't like roughhousing. Well we don’t like not roughhousing! Ya see the problem here? Well. Well what if we rotate the entire mountain 180 degrees around, so the mountain’s facing the other direction. That way, you guys can keep roughhousing and the mountain doesn't have to watch it! Sounds fine with me! What do ya say mountain! That’s okay. Only if you guys promise to stay healthy and not roughhouse after you rotate me. That mountain can talk? Just promise him anything, he’s out of his gourd. Yeah! We’ll stay healthy! Oh! Thank goodness! Alright kids, spin me the math around! Now I just need to set up some sort of pulley system. No! Over here! Don’t turn him around! If you do, I’ll miss looking at his beautiful back! It’s gorgeous! Huh? What? Really!? What!? A-but-ahh. Um, maybe what we can do is... Excuse me. We need your help. There’s no music playing and we desperately want to dance! Oh, ah just a second you guys. I’ll a- I’ll help you out in one minute. Hey! Pipe down over there! I want some peace and quiet! Let me just a- I need to be pollinated! Huh!? Pollinated all over to make my babies! Everybody please! One problem at a time! [Roars] My butt's itchy, but I can't scratch it! This water's too cold! [Sitting in a puddle, shivering] Mommy! Please keep the flies away from our mommy. [Their mom is out of the water surrounded by flies] [Point to a toad] That guy stole our triangle. [Points to Electroids] They swiped my plum. We wanna roughhouse! We wanna roughhouse! I’m naked! [laughs like the crazy old man he is] [Freaking out] What’s happening! [Freaking out as well] Ahhhhh! Everybody wants different things! And some of them want stuff that’s exactly the thing the others don’t want. Whoa, dude. Hold on. So this guy wants this and that guy wants that, but man. What do you want? [Flashback begins “What dooo yooou waaant?”] Want do you want baby? [Picks up Finn] Why are you crying? Margaret, this baby won’t tell me what’s wrong with it, and it’s stuck to a leaf, and it stinks. [Takes Finn] Give it here Joshua. This baby needs love and kisses to be happy. [Kisses Finn’s head several times and Finn starts laughing] There. See? Now it’s happy. You just kissed a boom boom baby. So don’t expect any more sugar from me, sweetheart until we wash your dirty dirty face. [Baby Finn laughs as he drools. Flashback ends.] [gasps] Hmm. Jake. What I want is to help anyone in need, so everyone is happy! [Laughs] Wow, that’s pretty corny man, but let’s do it dude! Wooohoo! [Holding megaphone] Ready over there mushroom gang? Ready Finn! Ready dragon? Yes sir! Ready Mountain Man? [Laughs]…I’m ready. Go! [The marauders begin roughhousing with strings attached to their limbs. The strings make several fans blow the flies off the fish's mother. As well as playing music] Yay! The flies are leaving! [The flies go and plug the coal man's ears] Heh. Can't hear a thing! [Throws to coal rocks onto two teeter-totters. This gives the toad back his plum and the Electroids back their triangle. They both cheer.] [The Mushroom Creatures hear the music and begin to dance in the flowers which the pollinate the cactus.] Pollen! Here they come! [She buds and the babies fall off] [The dragon scratched his butt on the cactus] Oh yeah! [The dragon melts the Ice Cube Creature with fire.] [Steam rises up and the [The steam blocks the No! Radical. [Shows Mountain Man's back to have a lake and river flowing down it] And I can still see this gorgeous back! Thank you Finn! You really helped everybody! [Marauders lift up Finn and cheer] Stop! I've got a problem. Well, what's the matter? This dolphin fell in love with me! That's the opposite of a problem! [ Faster! Faster! She's in danger! Who is he talking about? I have no idea. What?! Then why am I running so hard? Because... Because she's in trouble! Who is?! Marceline! Faster, Jake! She's in trouble! [runs faster] Hey, wizard, how do you know Marceline? I'm her spirit animal. Oh. [gasp] Marceline! What's wrong with her? She accidentally cast a sleep spell on herself, and now she's trapped in eternal slumber. Tell us how to break the spell. I'll transport you into Marceline's mind where you will walk through her memories and find the memory core. Then what? Find the memory of Marceline casting the sleep spell on herself. At your touch, you and the memory will be transported back to reality. But, like, if you know all this, why not just do it yourself? Entering a person's mind can be dangerous, and I don't have any arms. Just legs. [stretches leg towards Finn] Yeah, there we go... oh. [jabs Finn's forehead with toe] What? What'd you do to my forehead? When you get close to the memory, your forehead will glow. Here, take this. [gives Finn a sack] It's a sack of magic powder. Sit on the couch and sprinkle the powder on your head. Like this? [sprinkles powder on himself and Jake] Yep, like that. Feel sleepy? Mmhm. Good. Sleep now. But know this! If you fail, Marceline will be trapped in eternal sleep... forever! [gasp] And ever. And ever. [yawns] Did it work? Me neither. Huh? Whoa. Whoa! So... if we're in Marceline's memories, where's Marceline? Hmm... there she is! [walks up to young Marceline] Hey, little Marcy. Who are you guys? We're We're your friends! Hambo is my only friend. See? [holds up Hambo] You need another eyeball surgery, pal. Lucky for you, we found a donor. [rips button from shirt] Eyeball! Nurse, hand me the string. Yes, doctor. It's our last piece. Hold still. [stitches button into Hambo] I'm hurting you because I love you. Ahem! What are you guys still doing here? We're trying to wake you up. Do you know where your memory core is? Nope, but there might be anything behind that cellar door, and it rhymes with memory core! Ooo! Ooo! Could be jams and pickles down there!  [opens door] Weird. I think this door leads to a new memory; with food in it! Ooo, ice cream I want some! Huh? [ [opens new door] Come on, Finn! Yo, man. Wha? Marceline! [sniffling] Daddy, why? It's our treehouse. This must be when Marceline lived here. I'm so glad we're doing this, Ash. Yeah, me too. Oh, hey, wait. Watch this--I've been practicing. [summons rose] Marceline! I love, I love. [giggles] Who's this guy supposed to be? Ash, I guess. [sighs] [sniffs] This place reeks. Yo, man, your thing is glowing. My what? [touches forehead] Oh, my thing. We must be close to the core. I see another door over there. Come on. Wait a sec, Jake. It's that guy again. Hey, open your eyes, look at this, Mar-Mar. Check it out. It's my new wand. [holds a flower with four cherry blossoms] These cherry blossoms, look, look as close as you can, and they're real. [puts a finger near a cherry blossom and gets zapped] Wow. Awesome. Where'd you get the money for that thing? Oh, I sold that teddy bear that you love so much. To a Witch. You what? Are you crazy? That was my favorite thing in the whole world! That's why it's so valuable, genius--for potions. You're not, a genius. You're not, a genius. [crying] That's the last straw, Ash! That's it! You're a psycho jerk, and you ruined my life. But--but not all of it! This way, Finn! Check out this whacked out memory crack! It's ba-nay-nay down here! The core! All these orbs must be her memories. How are we supposed to know which one to grab? Play hot-cold with your forehead! Alright. [moves along the memory core] Hot or cold? Cold. Definitely cold. Warmer. Warmer, warmer! Whoa, hot. Hot, hot, hot! That must be the one! [wakes up] Huh? Hey, you have arms. That's right, genius. Huh? The important thing is... Marceline's awake. [magically beams Marceline awake] Marcie, Marcie! You're okay. Quit touching my hair! You had a magic accident, and we saved you with some help from your wizard friend. That's Ash. Ash? He's not my friend; he's my boyfriend. What?! That's right, babe. Ash, what's going on? Just picking up my girl for a night on the town; at my place. That's sweet. [kisses Ash on the cheek] What?! Oh, grow up you guys. I'm going to go freshen up. That's a relief. Oh, Ash. What? Don't you guys get it? I outbrained you. That wasn't the memory of a sleep spell you brought me. That memory was our break-up! [in memory orb] It's over, you psycho!! [orb is popped by Ash] That's enough of that? Oh, no! What? Yup. Come on, Mar-Mar, let's go. No, Marceline!  They're gone, man. He took her! Don't worry, Finn! I got the scent. [sniffs] Ah. Follow me. I could smell them in there. So what's the plan? Um. Okay, you take that shovel and keep banging it against that shed until Ash comes out to see what's happening. Then I'll sneak in, and I'll rescue Marceline. [fist bumps Finn] Nice. [bangs shovel against shed and Tiny Goblin comes out] My house! What's happening? No, don't hurt me! No, no, sorry. Shh, shh, wait! Help, somebody help me! [bursting out his front door] What's all this hullabaloo?! Hey, hold it, you, get back here! [chases after Jake] Finn? Finn, what are you doing? You can't be here! Ash doesn't like me hanging out with mere mortals. Yeah, okay. Sorry Marceline, I'll go. I just gotta show you something first.[shows Marceline sack of magic powder] Hello? Finn? Hey, there you are. [closes door] Finn, what's going on? What is this place? It's my old house. That magic powder--it put you in my memories. Me and Jake were in yours before, but Ash tricked us into stealing your memory of you breaking up with him. But it's okay because I saw the memory. Now I have a memory of your memory in my memory. See? [holds memory orb to Marceline] [memory orb] Oh, I sold that teddy bear that you love so much. To a witch. Finn, I think I'd like to wake up now. You gonna be okay, Marceline? Yeah. Thanks, Finn, I... Yo, Mar-Mar. What—What's with the chump? C'mon, I said no chumps. [pats his belly] [angrily grunts with a scowl] I want a turkey sandwich with to-ma-to. [grunts once more] Also pickles. [groaning] Ohh...I can't see...Somebody call my mom! Jake, why didn't you stick to the plan? Psshh. Hey, you wanna bump baby lumps? Sick. No. Just try to follow the plans, okay? Yeah. Come on out, cuties. It's safe now. Now get out of here. [The creatures scamper.] Hey, you hear something? Up there. [He and Jake scale the rocks to the top. From there, they can see an arena of unknown sorts.] It's a fat, fat warrior beat. It's all... [makes sound of swords clashing] [robotic voice] It calls me forth. [makes sound of swords clashing] Eh, it's probably just puberty calling. Fighters! Fighters! [He rings a stone bell with his large golden sword.] Seek you glory from the Mmmm... Maybe. Then step forth beyond the Moonlight seal to bathe in blood and glory forever. Nah. This is a trap. Ka-psshh.  [Finn and Then I'd bet the exits would all magically seal behind us. We'd probably have to fight Gladiator Ghosts. Yeah. That sounds... so dumb...[chuckles] and FLIPPING AWESOME! We're back! Fools! All exits are sealed! [The doorway seals up behind them. There is now only a solid wall.] Now you must fight my Gladiator Ghosts! Yeah. Okay. [chuckles] I'mma beat you with your own thing. Give it up! [ Hyperion, I'm sorry! Hyperion, my love! I'll kill you for breaking your promise! Yeah. Ah-ha-ha-ha. Good... Take these branches of palm. Yeah. That prize kinda stinks. Let's go, Finn. My thighs hurt.  [ Aw, man. Okay, it was fun. I'm keeping the branch. [ Where do you think you're going? [The Hmm. Okay, I have a plan. We'll do what the Fight King says, and defeat his ghosts to earn our freedom. [pauses] You're gonna follow my plan, right? Mmm-hmm. But, hey, if you replace me with a dummy, I could stay down here and dig for lava. Then I'd forge a molten hula-hoop. That's an entirely different plan... than my plan. What's the hula-hoop for? Morale, dude, This tomb will be as fun... [singing] ♪ As a tropical island, as a tropical island, as a tropical island, as a tropical island. ♪ Check it out, dude. [ [ Gladitoria continues for you, human, and, er... dog? Yup. This is dog. Arise, Priscus, Verus! [sobbing] Forgive me, Priscus! [He picks up the dummy and then vanishes.] Pity. The dog falls. Et tu, Verus? Heh. The combat endeth. Now come closer, champion. Dig-dig-dig-dig-dig-dig-dig. Two gongs? Something crazy's going on up there. [He stretches up to the surface and pulls the dirt dummy under.] It's me, Come closer, my champion. You have proven worthy of my favor. Hah. Word. Oh, this is bad. Accept your prize. [He hands Finn another palm branch. Finn eats it. Afterwards, Finn starts behaving strangely, striking the ground with both fists. Jake walks up to him.] Finn? Ah... The dog lives. Yeah. I lives. Finn, come with me, man. [Finn suddenly turns around and throws a punch at Sorry, man. But you crossed my kill zone. Fighters, rest now. [The So, how's your side of the plan going? Plan? What plan? To escape. I dig and stuff, and you fight to win, 'member? Yeah. I fight. To hear bones breaking and meat tearing. Ghosts don't got meat. I fight... to FIGHT! [Starts making a dummy from dirt] [inner thoughts] Hmm... Finn's acting weird. Probably due to a decrease in morale. Gotta get him that lava hula-hoop. We're ready for our next fight, Fight King. Gotta liven up this unhallowed ground.... for Finn. [ Habet! Habet! Habet! Heh-heh-heh. [He knocks over Achillea, slays Tetraides and then Amazonia, and blocks Triumphus' attack. Achillea, the gladiator whom Amazonia, I'm sorry! [She knocks down the dummy with her fist.] This next take-down is for you, my king! Rahhh... [gets punched by Triumphus] Heh-heh-heh.

Finn turns at the sound.] Why do you stop? Fight King, this Jake was a farce. Let me face the real Jake! Then this is round two, my vassal! Take his head for me! Yes, my king. [ What about the plan? This is the plan, Jake! Raah! [swings the blade] You're gonna kill me? [Jake starts stretching to avoid No! Yes... Yes... [swings his sword ineffectively at Jake's head.] Fight King!!! I can't do it. [drops blade] I can't kill him, Fight King. I can't kill my best friend. Finn? Not without a BIGGER SWORD! Yes... FINISH HIM!!! No! Aaarghh... [The Fight king suddenly shrivels up into a fragile shell of dust as the curse dies. The sky clears up, and the entrance to the arena reappears as well.] Wink. [fist pounds Jake] What? [lets go of Finn and returns to his original shape.] Dude, did you...? Was that all fake? Did you act all that out? Was that part of your plan? Mmm-hmm. [burps] So you planned to get all cozy with the Fight King and almost kill me from the get-go? Pretty much. Why didn't you say so? Because you always bungle my plans. But, if you had bungled this one... [deep voice] I might have, for real, chopped your head off. That's some funky junk, brother. Hey, Jake, you notice how all these ghosts are walking in pairs? Oh, yeah. I bet they're like us. Best bros who got trapped in that arena. But now they're free!  Ommmmm... [Whispering] [Whispering] Jake! What am I supposed to be meditatin' about?

[Finn and Jake bump fists.] Guys, you'll need to put these on. [To Finn] Pull back your hat. Neat! Stay close to me. [She claps nine times (the specific rhythm is "1 &-a 2 & 3 & 4 &"). Peppermint Butler appears and blows a huge bubble which engulfs the trio.] Whoa! At the heart of this tree is an ancient evil, held in a prison of amber—the Lich. What's that sound? He's casting spells—trying to get in your head and control your bod... but these gems are protecting our minds from his influence. If we lost the gems, we'd be defenseless. [The snail comes out of Finn's pack.] He would have full control over us. That's freakin' nuts! Beyond Iceberg Lake lies the ruins of the Lich's tower, where he was converting the planet's life force into unholy power to destroy all of Ooo... but before he could, the Legendary Billy attacked him and pummeled him into the resin of this tree. [The snail, who has reached the Lich, bangs his head against the amber, cracking it. The Lich converts his body to dark energy and escapes through the crack.] I—WHAT THE NUTS?! Dude, be a big sword! Oh, okay! I'll try! [Gasps] Quickly! To the other secret room! [The three arrive there.] There's only one known weapon that can harm the Lich. [She opens a cabinet with a key revealing said weapon.] The Gauntlet of the Hero. BIIILLYYYYYYY!!! Billy's big ol' beef fingers! Finn, you have but one chance. While the Lich isn't at full power, you must smite him with this gauntlet! [Finn equips the gauntlet. It becomes smaller to fit Finn's hand.] His only desire... is to destroy life. [Whispering] [Picks up crystal ball which shows an image of the Lich standing in a large fire.] If you fail... he'll kill everyone. No. That will not happen. Oh, and there's something else that I want you to have. The Lich's lair is supposed to be cold. ...I just don't want you to get sick. [She holds up a pink sweater.] Take this sweater. I made it myself. [Jake sniffs at the sweater.] I'm not great at knitting, but please wear it. I care about you, Finn. I love it. Me, too! [Appearing in window]  Hey hey hey! [The three scowl.] So... I've been thinking about this a lot lately and, well, uh... phew, gosh, I'm so nervous... Finn, and Jake, will you give me your blessings so I can marry Princess Bubblegum? What is wrong with you?! [In disbelief] What's wrong with me?! [Jake closes the window.] No! [Jake latches it.] Not the latch! Quickly now, Finn! Track the Lich by his trail of death. Here I go! Here I go! Be safe! This is our first fate-of-the-world deal! Yeah, man! We gotta shut this fool down hardcore! Running this fast makes my stomach hurt! Run through it, man! [The Ice King appears in front of Oh, my! How clumsy of me! What the heck, Ice King?! Hey, wait, you guys! I'm serious about Bubblegum! Look, I wrote her name all over my arms and legs! [He shows them evidence to this.] Yugh! Guys! It's not fair! She always hangs out with you, and it's not like you wanna marry her! [Blushing] Why are you following us?! [Throws a rock at him] Whoa! [Dodges it] I told you already. I want your blessings so I can marry Princess Bubblegum! [They keep running. No! [In desperation] Oh, come on! If you bless our wedding, then maybe she'll really love me. [Fed up, pointing the gauntlet at him] Ice King, go away, man. I will! When you bless our wedding! No thanks, guy. Hmm? How does this gauntlet [Banging on gauntlet] work?! Whoa! I can't turn it off! Punch it in the eye! Phew! Let's blow this stand! [To himself] I tried to do this right, but you've driven me to this—driven me to bad doing. Oh, Finn and Jake, please be okay. [Stress-eating a Candy Person] Please be okay... please be okay... Eh... stupid thing... come on... eh... Ice King?! Get outta here!! I didn't want to do this, but by not blessing our wedding, Finn and Jake have forced me to kidnap you. That's insane! I know! But I'll show them... I'll show them how they've hurt us! [Leaving with him] NO!! There! Out over the lake! After his butt! [Turning into a boat] I'm your dingy dog! Here! I'll help paddle! [To gauntlet] Hey. It's me. [The gauntlet looks at Waaaah! Ah, yeah, haha! Closing in... Gonna get you, man! [Readying gauntlet] Closer, Jake! [They get nearer and nearer to the Lich.] Closer... closer... Ah! PRINCESS?! NO! Oh, no. [Water falls on him and Princess Bubblegum.] Oh, gross. This water stinks. [He's had it.] ICE KING!! Look! Look what you've made me do to her! Guys! Don't let the Lich reach his well of power! [A green explosion of energy occurs far off.] [In terror] Oh, no!! He's made it!! Don't worry, Princess! Hey, where're you guys goin'? What's goin' on? I don't have time for this! Then let's go! My pack!! [Latching onto Finn like a backpack] It's okay! [To Princess Bubblegum] Man... I-I wanna go after them, but... that hole looks scary, doesn't it? [Beat] Well! Holes are holes! [Enters with her] The Lich! [Whispering] He's gettin' his powers back! Weird! [Raising a bony finger to what was his lips.] Shhhh... [Entering with Princess Bubblegum] Yep! Holes are holes! NYEH!! [He notices the Lich, who fires a green fire ball at the heroes.] Look out!! [Finn ducks out of the way.] That's it! I'm gonna bark 'im! Finn... Oh, no. Finn... [Finn turns] Come... [ Aren't you cold... Finn...? [Finn goes forward.] Walk into the well... Finn... Aren't you cold...? NO, I'M NOT!! I'VE GOT A SWEATER ON!! You are a joke to me!! [Fires green fire at Finn] [In realization] This sweater... It's keeping me safe! I care about you, Finn... Finn!! Buddy!! [Groans] Jake? [Looks around] Jake! Oh, Finn... you did it! We did? Hey, yeah, we did it!! Oh, you guys! This experience has brought us all so much closer together! Princess, I'm sorry for all of this. I love you, and I've decided to set you free. [Makes the cuffs disappear] Go free!! Uh... Whoops, I've got the dropsies! What's her condition, Dr. Ice Cream? She's totally gross over 90% of her body. The other 10% is crazy nasty. Will she make it, Doctor? [Gravely] I don't know, Nurse Pound Cake. [They quickly pull her to the emergency room, a heart monitor bleeps.] Put sugar on 'er! Two scoops! [She and Nurse Pound Cake each put two handfuls of sugar on her, but she starts flat-lining.] We're losing 'er!! No! Not my number one! Princess, if you die on me, I will never forgive you! I'll be lost—lost in my own emotional labyri— [Furiously punches him] YAAAAAH!! Wait, Finn! [Scared] What!? Her sugar levels are stabilizing. [Drained] Yes, I'm fine. I just need to rest. [Crying] Oh, my wife! Is there anything weird about her? I can't see through these pain tears! She's fine. Why? It's just that... after Princess fell into the well, I saw something strange happen. Something I still don't understand. [Finn's Root Sword is hurled at NO! Just shut your mouth, old man! "Old man?" Heh! What? I'm not old. Uh, yeah, you are, dude. Old? I'm... I see. It's all making sense now. Brrrrapapo! [Blasts window with ice magic, shattering it] I'm going, Princess. I'm sorry if my skin grossed you out. Nobody wants to see this old skin, I guess. [Tearing up] Nobody in the world. [With rage] JUST GET OUT OF HERE!! Peace. Sorry about that, Peebles. The ice wizard is a weak fool.... Huh? [Running in] Finn! Finn! The other princesses and I made you a new backpack! Whoa, Raggedy Princess! It's so awesome! Thank you. [Blushes] You're welcome, Finn! [Giggles and runs off] [To Princess Bubblegum.] You look like sick, grey meat, but we're gonna jack you up so awesome. We should wheel 'er to her bedroom, right? Yeah, man, and then we'll do magic tricks. Like fake magic? Yeah, like [ Princess... Princess... [Princess Bubblegum opens her eyes.] Surprise! We picked every flower in the Candy Kingdom just for you! [The flowers lie in the room, piling half-way up the wall in some places.] Whoo-oo! Princess Bubblegum? Oh, jeez!! [He hides behind Finn.] What's wrong with Princess Bubblegum?! [whispering] Quiet, dude. We're supposed to take care of her, not make her feel bad! I know, man, but she just seems... weird. She's just messed up from the accident, man. We just have to take care of her 'til she feels better. Uh... Okay, dude. Princess! Princess, no! You shouldn't be out of bed! [ Oh. Gotcha. I'll go get some tea! [He cuts his way through the pile of flowers and exits.] Princess... this sweater you made me kept me safe. I almost got super messed up, but... it saved me. And I wanted to say... thank you for imbuing this sweater with the power of liking someone a lot. Because... I like you a lot. [Princess Bubblegum is looking at him.] [ [Weakly] Finn... I need you to get me some things... Yes, Princess. [Entering with Jake] Princess! I brought you some tea—[He gasps, dropping the tea and sees Princess Bubblegum talking to Finn. He hisses like a cat.] Whoa... [Peppermint Butler runs away on all fours.] Uh... somethin' weird's goin' on... [approaches Jake from behind.] Jake! [Startled] AH! I'm gonna get some stuff for PB. Be right back. [Somewhat scared] Hey... Princess... Sorry you're not feelin' good. [She says nothing and looks at him annoyed (still breathing deeply).] Oh! I'll sing you a song! You love it when I sing songs! Uh... [Princess Bubblegum convulses and yells gibberish.] Uh, this song's not that good. It's a bad one. I... I'm stoppin'. [She yells again.] ...And starting a new song! [Plays bongos] [Princess Bubblegum yells in utter agitation. Her bed begins jumping up and down. Suddenly, demonic flames engulf the room.] AAH... [Princess Bubblegum touches him] [apparently melting.] Jake... Uh, bleach, lighter fluid, ammonia, gasoline, I dunno. Lady stuff. Plutonium... No, man... no... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! [Grabbing ingredients] Thanks. [Goes back in] No probs! Wait! Hold on! What's up? Listen... PB's bed was on fire. What?! Is she okay?! [Whispering] She made it on fire. With a match? No, man. With her brain... I think... [Finn stares confused.] Look, man, I'll show you! Jake, wh— Shh!! [ [Pointing to bathroom] Over there! [They go in front of the door. [Threateningly] I'm busy! See? It's fine. She's just havin' private time. I'm lookin' in! [Looks through keyhole] JAKE, WHAT THE HEY?! Oh, my gloob! [blushing.] Come on, man, that's pervy! You don't even know, man. DUDE?! Look! [ Hold on, Peebles! [He smashes down the door.] PRINCESS! [She grows bigger as she drinks the chemicals. She then picks up the whole bath tub and drinks deeply.] AAH! PUT DOWN THE TUB! Evil presence detected!! [Grapples with monster Princess Bubblegum] Must defend!! [poking Finn's face.] Hey, Finn, are you dead or what? [Waking up] Whaaah?... Ice King? What are you doing here? Hey. I had to keep an eye on the princess because she's being possessed by the Lich. [Grunts] You don't know that. But I do. I saw it with my wizard eyes! [Scene changes to the well.] In the well, I saw something come out of the Lich and go into the princess. But I wasn't sure it was real [scene returns to normal.] because when you have stanky old wizard eyes, sometimes you see things that are real, and other times it's like crazy crazy crazy in your face all the time! [Strange creatures dance around Finn and Jake in the Listen, you old poot. I'm not going to let you kill 'er twice. GET STUFFED. Come on, Jake. We're coming, Princess! Dude! I think we should let the Ice King help! He can freeze her, which could buy us some t— Dump that mess! I'mma set 'er free with my like-like sweater! Woooh, do it! [Propels Finn towards her with his hind end.] [while hurtling through the air.]I like you, Princess!! Finn!! Urrgh... [To himself] Liking her... didn't work. She's unstoppable... unless... [He sees her stomping on Jake's head and sighs.] [Reluctantly] Ice King, I... I need you to freeze Princess Bubblegum. Will you help me? [Gasps] Are you suuuuure? [Annoyed] Yes. Great! Weeee! [Laughs and grabs Finn before exiting] I'll distract 'er up top, you freeze 'er legs! [Throwing Finn] Wah! I'M A CAT! I'M AN AGILE CAT! JAKE! DUCK! [Jake retracts his body and falls to the ground. Yeah! Whoopie! You did good, Ice King. Oh, yeah? Yeah, man. Okay. I didn't kill 'er this time. Everybody saw that, right? [shattered.] Duuuude... We gotta get 'er to the hospital! Start assembling! Here, try to connect these two pieces! [The pieces don't connect.] Turn it... [The wads of gum stick.] Perfect. [The wad of gum is put on Princess Bubblegum's head to make a piece of her hair.] Give me more pieces, Doctor Princess! That's all we have, Dr. Ice Cream! What?! That can't be! [Gasps] What do we do, Doctor? [sighing] ...I don't know, Nurse Pound Cake. I hope she's okay... Attention, everyone... Yes... but there were some complications. NOOOOOOO!!!! Yes... I'm afraid... there wasn't enough gum to work with, so it appears Princess Bubblegum is now...... younger. [A young Princess Bubblegum steps out of the emergency room. Everyone gasps, astonished.] She's 13 years old now. Aw, dang it! Well, I'm outta here. Goodbye, everyone. [Exits] 13 years old? That's how old I am. [Princess Bubblegum smiles at [Amused] Whoa... [Embracing him] Give me a hug, hero. Pussy cat! Come here! Hey! Help! Don't worry! His spells never last long. Who are these guys? This is a great fight! Yeah! You never fought them? They come out every day at four o’clock on the dot. I guess that's because I meet Lady Rainicorn every day at four o'clock on the dot. Oh shoot! I'm late! You should stay, man. At five o'clock every day, I chop both their heads off, and they grow them back for the next day. Aw, man, that sounds awesome! I do want to stay and fight those guys, but I also want to hang out with my girlfriend. Boo! [sighs] I should probably go. I'll see ya later, buddy. [ Bye! Hyaaaaaaaaah! [ [sighs] Oh! Sorry! Sorry I'm late. Finn and I were fighting this shark and science cat, and I lost track of time. Anyway, I’m here now, M'lady, and I have brought to you half an orange. Ooh! 고마워! ("Thanks!") [A beam from her horn hits a tree and turns it blue.] Nice! Now make that green! [Lady turns the river green.] [giggles] Ha ha ha! Yeah, that's good. [yawns] 자러 가야겠다. (" I may have to go to sleep.") Sleep! But we were supposed to play viola together! 미안해. ("I'm sorry.")] [Kisses Jake on the head.] 니가 늦게 왔잖아. ("It's because you came late.") [sighs] Yeah. Sorry again for coming so late. 잘 자. ("Good night.")  Jake [Pops out of the viola.] Hi Jake. Oh, hey, Shelby. Why you looking so down in the dumps? No response, huh? Guess you're good. I'm fed up, Shelby! Hmm? Whenever I hang out with Lady Rainicorn, I miss out on fun times with Finn. And then when I hang out with Finn, I'm missin' out on Lady Rainicorn! [He lifted his hands in the air and he crashes into a tree.] Oh! [Popping out of the viola again.] Hey, Jake, why don't you just hang out with both of them at the same time? [ Ah, isn't this great? This is totally great. [To Finn] Isn't it? Yeah. [To Lady Rainicorn] Isn't it? 맞아. ("You’re right.") [Jake laughs deeply.] [Excitedly] What? What did she say? She said she also thinks it's great. Oh. Yeah. Hmm... [ We do? Yeah! Anybody have a joke? Oh, I have a joke! [Laughs.] Okay, [laughs] okay. Knock knock. 누구세요 ("Who's there?") She said, "who's there?" Diarrhea! 쟤가 설사래. ("He said "diarrhea.") 어, 나도 들었어. 뭐야, 하나도 재미없잖아. ("Oh, I got it too. What was that? It hardly qualifies as a joke.") [Sips drink] Did she say diarrhea who? Uh, no. No, she didn't say, "diarrhea who?" She didn't... say it. Lady, how 'bout you tell a joke? 글쎄.. 뭐가 있었을까? 아! 우리 완전히 다 벗고 상추밭 미친듯이 뛰어다닌 거 기억 나? [Jake and What's the joke? Uhh... well, the joke doesn’t translate very well. Man, I- I might leave. Is it okay if I leave? I kind of want to go fight something. Noooo! Don’t leave. [Gets up to pace.] If there was only some way you two could talk to each other directly. [Pause] Oh, dude! I just remembered! There's a universal translator device at the bottom of Lake Szelezon! The lake guarded by evil Lake Knights? Yeah, I can't remember why I threw it in there. Let's all go and get it! Whoa [Runs towards Jake] [whispers] Jake! You’re inviting Rainicorn? No offense, but isn't she a little too sweet for deadly adventure? Trust me, Finn, she’s the Rowdy Queen. She can do anything! Hmmm. Alright! Trust pound! Underwater camouflage! Lady! You are incredible! You should adventure with us all the time! [chuckles] All according to plan. 고마워, 나도 재밌었어. ("Thanks, I enjoyed it too.") Uhhh, what? [Runs up to them] Here's the translator. [He puts the translator around Lady's neck] Let’s see here. [Turns on the device and switches through the options] The voice options are... Old man, nerdy alien, ooor nightmare? [He has it switched to nightmare] Try sayin' something, toots! [Makes scratchy, grungy noises] [Jake looks disturbed and goes to change it to old man]... and then I ate all the peaches in the orchard, and that farmer was sooo angry! [Laughs] I like this voice! [Jake switches it to nerdy aliens] [Lady makes some gurgley, indistinguishable noises]  [Finn laughs again] [Jake switches it back to old man]...and that's the end of my story. [sighs] Well, at least with old man option we can understand him, I MEAN HER! I mean you, sugar! Hop on my back and I'll give you a ride home! [laughs] Whatever you say grandpa! [Flips onto her back] Hai-yah! Come on my darling. Wrap your legs around me. [sighs] I remember why I drowned that translator now. Hey grandpa, how are you able to fly if you don't have wings? Well, light travels from the sun. Then bounces off of our planet and then back into our eyes so we can perceive color. Whoa! [Being bounced by Lady’s wavy flying style] My body can intercept that light and dance around on it. [Jake is sliding off of her] Lady! It's a little rocky in the back seat here! [laughs] Shmow! [Screen cuts to the Forest Wizard giving away rings] That forest wizard is giving away free power rings! Do you wanna try gettin' some Finn? Yeahs! [Lady dives down towards the clearing] [Flies off Lady’s tail end] Laaaadyyy! [Falls towards the forest] Fiiiiinn! [Turns into a flat hang glider-like object] Lady! [Floats down into the trees and onto the ground] [He gets up] Lady! Finn! [He grows huge and shouts above the trees] Y'all around here? [Looks around] Dang it! [Turns to see fireworks coming from the trees accompanied by the sounds of Lady and Finn having fun with the rings] [While the forest wizard does tricks and the small animals cheer] Whoa! Did you see that!? This is like the funnest thing ever! [Burst through the trees and scares everyone away] There you are! [Shrinks down] Where were you guys? Wait a minute, you didn't fly down with us? We thought you were behind us the whole time! Noooo! [Looking sad] I fell off your tail end! [Turns and looks mad] I was shouting your name! [Comes up and nudges him] Ooh! Honey pot, we probably couldn't here you because of the cloud density. Jake! Check out these power rings! [The rings each expel some sort of magical display] Whoa. That's cool! You got ten of them? Yeah! Lady got some too. [Lady shows Uh, You want one of mine? I’ve got so many. Yeah! Thanks man! Oh. Wait, I can't take them off. I guess they're cursed. [Shoots blue flames from his fingertips] Still pretty cool though. Yeah, they're awesome. [Depressed] [Jake takes a sip of his drink] [ Oh, okay. [Jake starts walking up from behind them] That sounds nice. Oh I got the sword! Hey, Lady, you wanna go play music together or somethin'? Oh, oh. Uh, I would, but I-I'm in the middle of this game. Oh. [Goes over to Finn] Hey Finn. After this next game do you wanna go adventurin' with me? Lady and I are going to a party in the Cloud Kingdom tonight. [Jake looks startled] You should go to that with us. Humph! Humph Humph Humph! [sighs and looks sad] [sighs and grumbles] Jake stop sighing you're messing up my game! [Jake sighs again] Jake! [ Mmmm, Nothin'! Awww dang it! Man, Lady, you’re too good at this! Hey, It's time to party with clouds! Jake, you comin'? No! [Walking up to Jake] Dude, I thought you wanted to spend more time with me and Lady together? I do. [Looking hurt and sad] Then come on. No YOU go ahead! [In a harsh tone] And YOU have fun with MY girlfriend! Uhhh... [Jake sighs] We're gonna head to the party, but you should meet us there and stop acting weird. [ [Finn and Lady are seen flying away outside the window] [sighs] [sighs] [Looks over at a Finn-and- Hello Cloud Kingdom. Uh, yes, hello. Um, I’m lookin' for Finn the Human and Lady Rainicorn. [Cloud man throws a soda to someone] Hello, can you hear me? Hello. Yeah, they left a while ago. A while ago?! [ [Lady changes a tree pink.] [ I like you too Finn. Nooo [Falls onto his knees with his arms in the air] oooooo! My girlfriend... in the arms of my best pal! [Picks up phone] Well, TWO can play at that game, sweet cheeks! [He scrolls through his contacts] Let's see... "Doug, Todd, Jerry, Dennis, Reggie, Peter, George, Larry, Luke, David, Benton, Mike R., Mike H., Mike A., Gareth, Jennings, Mr. International, Mr. Outrageous, Captain Majesty, The Flying Lettuce Brothers, Pete the Punk"... [gasp] Tiiffaanyy! [In an evil tone] PERFECT! Muhuhaha! [Calls Tiffany.] [Lady and [Him and Tiffany are sitting on stumps playing viola] Yeah, yeah, louder. [Sees Jake and Tiffany] [gasps] Jake what are you doing? Oh, hey guys. I'm just sharing a tender moment with my beautiful friend Tiffany. Stop! You're making Lady jealous! Well I’m trying to make you both jealous! [Lady looks mad] Why would I be jealous of Tiffany? Becaaause, Tiffany's a boy! [Tiffany spins around to face the camera] [Laughs evilly] Jake's MY best friend now! FOREVER! [Looks extremely startled] [gasps] [ Jake, what's going on with you? [sighs] I guess I'm just jealous of how much you and Finn like each other. I'm hanging out with Finn because you wanted us to get to know each other better. I know. Gaah. [ [Kicks Finn off of him] No! Jake will be mine! I'm sorry I'm an idiot baby. Forgive me? Oh sweet potato, I love you BECAUSE you're an idiot. You make me feel like a genius! [Lady and [giggles] 이게 더 좋아? ("Do you prefer this one?") Yeah! Waaay better! [they hug] Beat it Tiffany! Go on! Get! You'll never defeat me! I will! Be Jake's best friend! Because I'm! [Lady is wrapped partially around Shut up man, I don't wanna hear that stuff. [He steps into the circle made by Lady] Lemme get in there. Let's never be stupid again. Wait! Let's always be stupid! Forever! Shelby. Shelby, wake up. [Wakes up confused and dazed.] Where am I? Tree Trunks, what's going on?! Uh, you've been snoozing on my dome. I just woke up in this room with these fellas Nectar, Ice Cream, and one of the Lemoncarbs. Awake. [starts turning his head around.] Avast, hold tight your buns, if buns you do hold dear; for time has come to wake and run and not give way to fear! What are those awful words? [turns his head to the wall and to the normal direction.] I'm reading the wall. [Points to the wall.] They are wall words. Beyond this room are a thousand rooms, outside of them still more. Behind each door, on every floor, danger, danger, ever more. Stranger, hark! The traps galore may kill you whilst you do explore. To free yourself - [waits for Ice King to start reading.] [Writing something in a book.] Huh? Oh. Now where were we? To free yourself from this tomb, and nevermore re-enter, find the room amidst the rooms that lies exactly center? It's a map! I no longer need this map. I have infallible recall. Oh! The room is trying to hug us! [She jumps through a door which leads to a bottomless chasm.] Oh no! Oh, dag. Check out my mods, bro. [ Enough of this! [Opens a latch on the floor which was the latch for a trapdoor which they all fall through.] Huh? This room doesn't have any doors. W- We're trapped! [groans] This is wrong. The map lied to me-e. It doesn't want me to find the EXIT! Ice King, h-how do you taste? Uh, nice, I guess? Mild or SPICY?! Oh, uh - [has a flashback of himself kissing his hand in front of Gunter.] Kinda lonely. Make yourself into food! Now! You're going to eat me? Yeah, right. Slop your mouths up. I have found an oven and baking supplies. I can make an apple pie for all of us. Make them fast, servile. If you want a taste of my juicy apple pie you better be nice. You got that? I am sorry. Make pies, slave. Okay, that's better, now let's see about this pie business. All right, gentlemen. Have a look at my luscious, gooey apple pie. No! [he punches the rat, possibly killing it and starts eating the pie out of the rat's mouth.] Acceptable. Uh, Lemongrab? WHAT?! Never mind. Come on, you guys. That mouse showed us the room door. [to Neptr] Say, you know what's weird? What, Papi? Well, isn't it weird how Tree Trunks' ability to make pies is specifically what helped us escape from that room? I make pies, too, Papi. Right, yeah, like, battery pies or summin'? [laughs] No. Real pies. Don't you remember? I am your s- [gets cut off by Ice King.] Hey! Look, another room! Good grief, it's humid in here. That door will lead us closer to the exit! Hold up, hold up! [He grabs Lemongrab's arm and pulls him away from the pool.] Look! [He points at the fish monster, that has a plug chained to his tail. It's plugged up to a hole so the water wouldn't escape.] There has to be a way to get across without that thing chompin' our WOO-HOOS! Can't you fly us across, Papi? Oh yeah, I can sure try. Nggh! Aw dang, this heat is negating my powers! Can't do nothin' with this steam coming off the water. [ NGH, glob! Fah! [He attempts using his ice powers on it but he fails.] Nagh! Look at this! [He does a raspberry with a disapproving face.] Well, that's it. Show's over. I'll just die here and y'all can eat my body if you want to survive. Golly, how we ever gonna worm our way out of this... fishy situation? I think I have an idea. That's a girl, Tree Trunks! You can do it! [sighs] This is gonna work out just fine. Oh, that's warm on my undercarriage. H-help me guys! Yes, Papi! [He approaches him and pinches his knee.] NNGH! Lemongrab, c'mon! Bleh! Wow, that was heavy, man. Aw yeah, I've been reborn! Look! [He points at the path leading to the door. The rest of the water has escaped.] Let's go then! Papi, no! [He releases a pie from his microwave, and he gets hit by a tentacle too.] Ouchies! Look out,  Shelby! WOOAH! WUOAGH! The hidden door! Hohuugh.. [He falls to the ground, looking floppy and thin.] My vital essence depleted... Must.. replenish... Oh, step back, you all. [ Ugh! Ew. Nugh.. That'll do, Slave Trunks. To the spiraling ledge! [He points at the exit of the room.] We almost there, Lemongrab? Yes. Faster, TT! Don't criticize my running, Shelby. This door leads to the center exit! The door is secured with an esoteric encryption system. Well that's okay, 'cause you can hack the mainframe or whatever, right BMO? I'm not BMO, I'm your son Ohhhs! I grabbed the wrong robot! [starts muttering angerly.] Dang! Nuts face! Uhhh ... what is going on here Ice King? Yes, I'm getting a weird feeling in my stomach, and I think it's 'cause of you, Mr. Wizard you'd better fess up to whatever you're doing. [Cuts to Ice King looking around] I got no time for nobody dancing around and acting fool at my expense. [Cuts to scenes of the others looking around as she speaks] I'm Huh? Wha-wha-what's she sayin'? So stop sellin' fib-bibs and give it straight! [Pointing at Ice King with her trunk] [Closes book] Grrrr! All right! I knocked you all out and brought you here! [Puts the book inside his beard] I'm sorry, but I had to do it. Each of you possess the exact qualities to pass the various tests of this dungeon Tree Trunks with your baking skills; [cuts to Tree Trunks] Lemongrab with your lemony-juicy... [cuts to Lemongrab] Essence. Yeah... [cuts to Shelby] Shelby, who should've been the bait for the fish. Yeah..but no, thanks. [cuts to Neptr] And..BMO, who should've been here instead of this weird piece of junk that I don't remember nothin' about. [Neptr looks ashamed, slowly gets off the screen] Ahhh, I failed! Father! Look at me. [ Are you happy with me now, Papi? [Laughs somewhat maniacally] Yes! Yes! Oh, my son! [Grabs and hugs Neptr, he seems happy] The grand prize of my loins! Now you see why I needed to bring you all here. Behold! The Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving! What's it do? Whatever goes in the Magi's flames..comes to life, anything at all! Uh, like an ashtray? [Looking extremely rejoiced] Yes! Isn't it amazing?! [Annoyed] Uh..You should've told us! I would've freaking brought something! Do not be sad. Because I brought the ultimate thing! [shows them his book] This. Your journal? Except..it's not my journal! [flips it] It's my Fionna & Cake fan-fiction! [Shelby stares at him with contempt] All my brilliant fantasies will now be real. [ [robotic tone] You serve no function, you must be destroyed! [Ice King throws the book in the flames and the Magi grabs it as Yes! Yes! [A very dumb crossed-eyed book with arms and legs comes out of the flames] Woo, hahaha, yeah! [Farts] [ Oh, good..you're awake, you bum. Look what you did..[ [Serious] This is the spot? Right here? [The Magi comes out of the ground, C'mon Ice Cream. We-we're leavin' [The book farts on Ice King, he is lying on the ground] [Sniffs] I'm tellin' you dude, my pie-dar's goin' 'nay-nays. [Sniffs] Oww! Write in me! What the—This is very strange. TT! Where is the pie at?! [Shelby gets off Tree Trunks] Oh, Mister Lemoncarb ate it. [Quickly] Bye, don't follow me. [ Hey, Jake can I catch you a ride back home? Yeah, but what the heck is goin' on here? [Points at Ice Kng that is behind him, sitting on the grass and holding the book] Ice King was doin' some... desperate business, but it didn't work out. [Neptr approaches Ice King] He seems pretty bummed out 'bout it. Don't be sad, Papi. Your characters can always be real in the garden of your mind. [Holds Neptr's hand] They can? [Wears that expression of silly hope again] Remember when you showed me your imagination zone? Yes! Yes, if I can concentrate... [closes eyes] [Laughs] It worked! [Speaking with Neptr's voice] I missed you, Ice King! Oh, Fionna, can dreams be real as waking life? Of course they can! Dreams are real! Then I will wait for you, from across the threshold of consciousness. Our worlds will surely meet, Ice King. [Blushing with his eyes closed] I, too, feel this; and it feels so strong it must be true. [Ice King keeps talking to himself waving his hands while holding the book, book says something] Who in this world is sadder than the Ice King? [Ice King keeps rambling on] Me, watching this. [flailing hands around] Yeah! Write it down! Write it down! Happy birthday! Jake! Is that you? I can't see! [Moves arms around blindly] Right! That's because- I'm blind?! Jake! I'm blind on my birthday! No dude, you're blindfolded. [Feels blindfold] Oh... [Puts hands on the blindfold] Keep the blindfold on. I've got a surprise for you. [Takes blindfold off of Finn] Surprise! [Takes the blindfold out of Jake's hand] Orange blindfold? That is a surprise! That's not the surprise. This is! You got me a train? [Hugs Jake tightly] Thank you, Jake! [Struggling to talk] This isn't the gift! Huh? We have to take the train to get to the gift. Oh. Almost as cool as a free train! [Hugs Jake again] I'll go get the tickets. Okay! Hey! Mr. Conductor! It's ma birthday! Oh? Climb aboard my train, little boy, you're my new friend. He hehe hehehe. [Continues to laugh while Finn has a worried look on his face] All aboard! [Rings bell] This is gonna be the best birthday ever! Heheh. I'm gonna go grab a schedule! [Climbs off the seat and out of the train car] Whoa! [Hits Colonel Candy Corn, who is his passenger, in the head with himself by mistake.] Terribly sorry, Colonel! [Chuckles] That's quite alright. Just don't let it happen again. [Chuckles again] Sorry about that, folks. We're approaching Gumball Gulch now. The rides gonna get a little bumpy until we reach the straight-away and you might wanna buckle up! [Laughs] [Comes back with a schedule in his hand.] Found a schedule! Great! Now find your seatbelt. Jeez Louise! So sorry about that Colonel! [Hits him again] Beg your pardon! [Hits him again] Sorry! Whoa!! [Hits Colonel in the head repeatedly] Colonel, I am so sorry. Hey! We're in the straight-away! Oh, I want to see! [Peers out window. The train hits a bump and he hits Colonel in the head once again.] I'm gonna kill you! A skeleton... [Mr. Candy Cane's hat falls off. Dr. Donut begins to walk over to him.] Is he going to be okay, Doctor Donut? He doesn't look good. Hey man, this is kinda a bad scene. Maybe we should get off the train and huff it to your surprise. Are you kidding? It's a murder mystery! On a train! [Squeezes his hat's ears] And we're gonna solve it. [Crosses arms] Alright. What'dya think, Doctor Donut? Any clues? [Touches Mr. Candy Cane's skull] Hmm. I think it was the guy would screamed 'I'm gonna kill you.' No, no! It wasn't me, I swear! Passengers, passengers! I don't think it was Colonel Candy Corn. Thank you! No, in murder mysteries it's never the first person you think of. Never ever. So who do you think it is? [Turns to Colonel] Colonel, do you have any enemies on this train? Just one! And his or her name is... See? I knew it wasn't him! [Starts to walk down the train car] But now we need to figure out who his enemy is. It could be anybody. It could even be you. Yes it could. [Walks over face to face with him] Except I didn't do it. But... we don't know that. [Points at him] You singled me out to take suspicion of yourself! Are you Colonel Candy Corn's enemy? What? No! I was just trying to join in on the conversation! [Walks away from him and points at him] Suspect numero uno! Rat traps! Really thought I was onto something! Now I know this is going to sound crazy, but what about the conductor? No it's definitely not him. [Disappointed] Oh. Why not? 'Cause he's weird and creepy. And you never suspect the creepy guy because he's too obvious. Whatever, man. I'm gonna go sit and look at the schedule. [Turns and does so] We're running out of suspects. And we're running out of time. Attention! [Clears throat and laughs. He rides into view on a skateboard] Attention passengers! [Does a nollie skateboard trick.] Nollie, heheheh. Yeah hi, it's me, the conductor. Heheh. Anyway, I couldn't help overhearing that someone thinks I'm weird and creepy. And you know; I'm not weird and creepy. [Laughs] I'm cool and awesome. [Laughs for a longer period of time] Happy birthday, Finn. [Rides off] Hey Jake. Yeeeeeeeaaah? The conductor was just here and he was weirder and creepier then before. What?! No way, he was cool and awesome! Anyway, it's still not him. [Turns and walks down the cabin hallway.]] No. The murderer is right here among us. [Walks to Doctor Donut]] Isn't that right, Doctor? [Looks around] You think it was me? When Candy Cane guy was murdered, you diverted suspicion to Colonel Candy Corn. [Crosses arms] Then killed him to protect your alibi. Are you kidding? Dude, I think you're waaay off. Am I? Or am I way on. Son of a- My hunches aren't getting me anywhere! The killer is laughing at us, Jake. What'dya think we should do? Hmmm... We need hard [Punches fist] evidence! Ha! [Picks up two eggs, a fish and the cabbage.] A basket of eggs, fish and cabbage! It's a receipt! From an earlier train ride. From another train! Jake! I found a book! It's a dictionary! It's sheet music! [Shows the music to Jake] It doesn't make any sense to me. [Raise arms quizzically] Me neither! [Raises arms quizzically and then crosses them.] Maybe the murderer is just too smart for us. Yes! Jake, that's it! It's all so clear now! Gather everyone in the caboose and I will reveal a murderer! You're the only remaining passengers. So the murderer, is in this caboose. [Everyone starts to murmur.] Let me explain how I know who the murderer is. [Points] I saw Pineapple Guy skim through the sheet music. Sheet music to a song that's very special to Lollipop Girl. A song that reminds her of Ice Cream Guy. [Lollipop Girl and Ice Cream Guy look at each other]  Before Colonel Candy Corn's aide, Doctor Ice Cream was in possession of a basket of cabbage, fish and eggs. [Doctor Ice Cream blushes and turns to Pineapple Guy.] And you, Pineapple Guy, have cabbage bits on your socks! [Pineapple guys moves his feet, showing cabbage bits on them] And you! [Points to the back of the group] Chocolate Bar Guy! [Everyone turns to him. But the real murderer is someone no one suspects! The real murderer is- No one was the murderer?! The conductor's still on the train! Oh yeah! He did it. Yay, you did it, you solved it, Finn! I knew it; because he's creepy. What?! Humpf. I know. You knew he was the murderer all along. I couldn't have done it without [Raises finger to poke him] you, you, you [Pokes Jake and then hugs him tightly] Thank you. We make a great team, pal. You feel kinda bony. [Opens eyes, screams and drops Jake. Bends down and touches his skeleton.] Jake? [He hugs his skeleton.] NOOOOOOOOOOO! [Chuckles] Hey. How could you murder all those Candy People?! And, you murdered Jake on my birthday! [Turns Jake's skeleton around.] Yes, and you're next. [Puts down Jake's skeleton and picks up the Root Sword.] Wrong! I'm coming for you! [Jumps into the air onto the train car with the Conductor] This is for Jake! [Swipes down his sword and the Conductor dodges it. They collide swords and Wait! [Stretches himself around to reveal that it is actually Jake covered in paint. [Throws sword aside.] You're alive!! [Hugs Jake tightly and laughs] You were the conductor the whole time?! [Licks the rest of the paint off of himself.] Yup. You were so focused on the murders because you never even noticed! [Flashback shows that when So nobody was murdered? Nope! Not unless you count the train's control panel! Dude, open your eyes! Hey, we're alive! -to you! Wow, this is the best birthday ever. Thanks, Jake. You deserve it, buddy. [Points fork at Finn] Because you're a great friend. I think my favorite part was landing on the Gelatin. That musta taken forever to plan. [Raises a piece of cake to his mouth and eats it.] Nope! That part was a total accident. Oh. So we could have... Died horribly? Yes. Happy birthday, pal! [Goes back to cutting his cake] Uhh, hello? Hi. Uh, is this the secret mee—[shows a guy sitting on a toilet & reading a magazine] What errand? What haste? Uh. Oh, shoot. Oh! "To beelzebub with the brewer's knave!" [the candy person hits a green button, which opens a door behind a urinal, Ahh, Kenneth. Hey, Starchie. Glad you could make it. I officially call this meeting of the veritas brigade to order. [closes his eyes] Lux in tenebris. Lux in tenebris. [opens his eyes] So, anybody have weird stuff to report? Well, sometimes at night, I see a shadowy figure around Princess Bubblegum's tower. I have a feeling it might be otherworldly! Whoa, this is some good stuff. We are this close to finally exposing the princess' shady dealings. [shows Princess Bubblegum watching the meeting on a camera while eating] Meanwhile, PB remains blissfully unaware up in her ivory tower. [Princess Bubblegum snorts and laughs] Excuse me. I believe I've made a startling discovery of my own. [takes a machine out of his jacket pocket with a pickle taped to it] I've developed this high-tech device. It broadcasts waves that—theoretically—disrupt parallel dimensions! Whoa, Kenny boy, you're blowing my mind. [Kenneth chuckles, then an evil chuckle is heard] So...a tinkerer, eh? Fiddling at the fringes of unknown realms. Tell me, Kenneth, will you be ready when the flames of those evil places consume everything you hold dear?! [goes to Kenneth and hits the device out of his hand] I thought not! Hey, Peace Master. [gets hit in the face with Kenneth's device and falls backwards] Ohh! [Nurse Pound Cake gasps] Oh! My noodle. There is something very wrong dwelling in the Candy Kingdom...a dark entity I plan to purge from the face of Ooo. [shows her watching the meeting] Oh! Uh oh! Its presence has infected every home, every place of business, even here in this very room. [shows the Banana Guard sweating, his fake nose and mustache starts to fall off and he fixes it] Yes, this foul creature watches us even..[breaks the light and takes out a security camera] Now! [everyone gasps, Whoa! Holy flippin' flap! Red alert! [flips a switch, making the alarms go off] Pep But, start brewing up some chamomile tea so I don't stress out! [Peppermint Butler goes to make the tea] [growls] Sorry, I hate evil so much. It's all cool, Peace Master. Truth sleuths keep it real. Yes. As lone scouts, we may fall, but together we will stand as a mighty force! [a device beeps, he takes it out of his pocket] Oh, dang. I gotta go. [starts to run to a window] But I shall return in one hour! [runs out the window] Alright, Peace Master. We'll be ready. [takes a bite of the pickle on Kenneth's device] Mm. Dill-icious! [shows Finally. Uh, sorry about the wait, guys. Daddy was pontificating. [they start to drive off] Hey, Dad, can we go to the Sorcery and Dark Arts fair tomorrow? No, honey, that stuff is highly inappropriate for kids. Daddy works very hard to protect you guys from that kind of stuff. If you only knew of the monstrosities that lurk around every corner. [throws a shoe at Peace Master] Dark Arts! [his children laugh, he groans] Stop laughing! You're stressing daddy out! [his baby vomits on him, causing him to crash into a building] See?! See what happens when you mess with the dark arts? [kicks the bumper of his car] I'll get you, dark one! You wrecked [running to a room, panting, Colonel Candy Corn and the Banana Guard are sleeping and snoring] Yo! Red alert! [the Banana Guard says "Oh, shoot"] Right, guys? What'cha doin' about it?! Whoa, be careful about old man naptime, please. That could have been it for me just now. What is going on here? [shows three other banana guards playing with a miniature set of land] Don't. [covers part of the set] No! [looks at another banana guard] Hey, watch your pieces, man. [sighs] I thought you were gonna whip these guys into shape, Colonel. PB, you can't teach a butterfly to bark. You know what I'm saying? [shows two banana guards playing with pieces of the set] Well, they like my stories. They're good listeners. It ain't like them old days with those hard-nosed Rattleball boys. [shows [chuckles] Okay, you guys. Keep up the good work. [walks out of the room backwards, shows Peppermint Butler going through a door then another one, [they come out of the tub and gasp for air] What was your count? Uh, 3 minutes. What about you? Uh, 3 minutes, 30 seconds. What's that? Your invisible watch? No, I was just pointing at my wrist. [comes out of the water and gasps for air] 57 seconds. Oh, dang, we were both counting fast. Hey, Rattleballs, are you sure you're waterproof? No. Do you even need to breathe, Rattleballs? Continue training. 3, 2, 1...[they all go under water again] [goes back to [shows him meditating in the room with candles lit] Uh, just a second. Just leave it out for me. I'm gonna go find Finn or Rattleballs or somebody to run down this Peace Master bozo. [Peppermint Butler says "Okay, take your time."] "Take my time"? Alright. Ooh-wah, oooh-wah. My light will move in darkness. I go unseen by low level biddies. [chants an incantation, shows him changing and getting armor put on] Whah-ha! [his fire sword opens] Yes! Light of the hermit, reveal my nemesis, and in the folds of Horus, carry me in haste! Fold, I say! [it folds and shows Peace Master, [carrying his baby in a wrap] You going stinkhouse, baby? Ooh. [turns to Peppermint Butler] Whomp! Almost got me, but my lucky talisman sensed your presence. [blows the paper off his face] Haha! [they fight, Peace Master takes his fire sword and burns his armor off] [the background changes back to the Candy Kingdom] Look here, friends. The beast lies exposed! [Peppermint Butler stands up] Oh, this is a mistake. That's my boy, Peppermint Butler. His powers of darkness made me go crazy and crash my minivan earlier! You need to chill, Peace Master. I'm just a harmless, old butler. [lifts his pant leg up a bit, revealing something shining] Mm? [Peppermint Butler takes a little sword out of his sock and charges at You can't do that to our friend! Oh. I see how it is. Maybe y'all should get in here, too. [they all scream and run off, shows Peppermint Butler floating in a green slime and gurgling, saying "My candy flesh!" [takes out his device, hits the button, turns the knob, and rubs the pickle] Dimension disruptor, come on! Please, please, please, please! [the device beeps, Peace Master's hat starts glowing] Yes! [drops his hat, Peppermint Butler crawls out from under it] Impossible! [coughs and gasps for air] Time-out. You can't time-ou— [throws something on the ground] Whazaa! Whoop! [black smoke appears and No! Your dirty hobo birthday tricks won't save you long time! You hear?! You still here? [voice-over] Uh, no? I-I don't know. No. Then hear my challenge! On the field of wizard battles, armed in my talismans of light, I will destroy you and free my children from the spell you cast over their minds! [backs away] I accept! See you tomorrow, butler. [picks his hat up and puts it back on] See you tomorrow, momo. [growls] Tomorrow! [scene changes to the next day, on the field of Wizard Battle] Peppermint Burfer, show yourself! [the ground rumbles, a creature comes out of it and shows black smoke, You're the momo. Your spells are no match for my righteous charm sack. [Peppermint Butler opens his cape] Dark arts! My kids! You like hunting monsters, do you? [lifts up Peace Master's son] Lords of the Nightosphere, he must pay a penalty. [Peace Master's son gets covered in gold crystals] Transfigure this babe into a super-weirdie! [the gold crystals crack, showing Peace Master's son in a different body shape] Ha! Noooo! Bam! [throws Peace Master's son into the air] Now you got a monster kid. Son! [flying through the air] Look, Pappy! Dark magic! Remember, you still got two non-monster kids. And if you want to keep them that way, you better toss all your charms down the hole! [turns around] I will smite thee. A'ight. [turns Peace Master's daughter into a fairy-like creature with wings, a tail, and a horn] Whoa, sweet! Nooo! [cries] Alright, alright. Okay, you win. [throws his charms down the hole] One more thing. Show us your underwear. You fiend. [his underwear showing, his son laughs] Now, um, uh, walk around like a big chicken. [walks like a chicken, clucks] [Peace Master's kids laugh] Now eat some dirt off the ground. [lying on the ground] Please don't make me. 'Ey! You want three demon babies?! [picks some dirt up and eats it] Okay, stop. I took it too far. [Peace Master spits the dirt out] We're done here. R-Run along, children. [throws Peace Master's baby to him, his 2 other kids go to him and hug him] Dada, can I go to the park and eat flies? [sniffles] Yes? [scene changes to him closing the door of his minivan, he gets in his van and drives away, shows Peppermint Butler walking away, the camera zooms out] [voice-over] Princess, I think I got something on camera 206! [the camera shows a snail licking a plant] Just look at that sicko. [looking at a different monitor] Where's Peace Master?! Gah, I am freaking out here! [ Whff! Thanks. [drinks the tea] [talking quietly] Well, how do I check my e-mails on this? Ahh! Get it off! We're coming! Be careful! Grab him, Jake! Jake! W-whoa! Whatever. [Gets thrown by the deer. Oh, what happened? Where's the deer? Paging Dr. Ice cream! Dr. Ice cream cream for my mouth! [sees his legs in a cast] Ahh, dude, I broke my stems! Hello? Jake? Princess? What the blizz. Come on, people. Huh? Oh, Finn, you're awake! Yeah, I'm awake, but my jams are all busted. Right. Yeah, I saw that. So, what happened? Did you save everybody? Oh, yeah, I think so. Maybe. So, Jake, there's nobody here. Did you notice that? Yeah, pretty freaky. [pulls back his hood, revealing his head is bandaged] Don't worry—ouch— [touches his head] they're all hiding. From what? From me! What?! It's my birthday, man! Lady Rainicorn put together a elaborate surprise party. She told you? No, but I know Lady Rainicorn. Ouch! [feels his head] This is totally something she would do. Think about it. Oh, yeah, okay. So, wait, the whole kingdom is in on it? Yes, and they'll only come out if they think we'll be surprised. So we got to act like we're totally unaware, okay? Okay, man, and how do we do that? Just do what I'm doing. [ The what? Come on, come on! [motions Finn to come with him] Whoa. When did you find time to build this? I don't know. It didn't take long. [decorates hut with Christmas lights] Hm. So, what should I do now? Collect branches for the hobo fire, dude. Okay. [wheels himself away] [feels head] Ouchies. A hobo fi-ya, fi-ya, fi-ya. [loudly] Boy, it sure is quiet around here! Uh-huh! I'd probably pee all over myself if somebody jumped out and surprised me! [sniffs his armpit] Oh, ugh! I stink! How long was I out for? A day or two? [sees a fountain] Huh. What a convenient place to bathe. [loudly] Sure seems like a good time to come out if y'all are just hiding and you don't, you know, wanna see me [takes off shirt and hat] pop my top! [leaves wheel chair and gets in the fountain] Ahh, yeah, that's fresh. I nobody's gonna jump out of the bushes and peeps my bod! [laughs] [shakes his head] Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl! Hmmm. Just gotta char off the rotten parts—good as new, man! Stay vigilant. Eat your protein. Jake? Hmm? I'm starting to question your theory about the surprise party. [drops hot dog] Shhh! [hushed] Don't talk so loud! They might hear you! [hushed] But what if they're in trouble? [bites a hot dog] What if something happened to them? We should try looking around. Noooo! [grows huge] You'll ruin my surprise party! Oww! [holds head] [groans] [goes back inside hut] Dude, are you okay? Just promise me, Finn. Promise not to look around. [sighs] Okay, I promise. [mumbling] ...my birthday's gonna be rad. Hey, it's you! [points] Thanks for breaking my legs, ya dumb-butt! That sounds like Candy People! Jake. Jake! [moans] What? I heard a sound coming from the sewer! We should check it out. No, man, they'll surprise party me when they're ready. Be patient. [groans] I'm being patient! I waited all day, Jake! Well, I've been waiting six months! Wait, what are you saying? [yawning] [a bug crawls out of his ear] Everything's gonna be fine, even if we have to wait forever. Have I been asleep for six months?! Yeah, but don't worry about it, man. [thinking] Face it, Hmm? Finn? [hurriedly wheeling himself toward the manhole] [panting] Noooo! Don't ruin the surprise! [stomping on the remains of the chair] Rah! Ah! Ah! [pants heavily] [sees Finn crawling toward the manhole] Noooo! [stretches his arm to grab him and picks him up] Oh, my Glob! [groans] Surprise! [reveals marionettes made from trash] "Happy birthday, [hears whispering again] Hey, Jake! What are you doin'? This is how my party's gonna go down. Shake it, my friends. [bounces marionettes] Hey! Hey! Sure is great seeing y'all here. Really makes me think. Ow. [touches head] [holds up a sock puppet] Lady, did you get extra TP for all the potty people? [as Lady] No. [normal voice] Well, we might have some party poopers here, and I want to be sure they don't wipe their buns on my cake. Can I join your puppet party? We'll have twice the puppet voices! You won't run away? Naw, man, I'm with you. Happy birthday, Jake. Really. Finn! Glad I can untie you, buddy. [unties rope] Check it out! Finn finally made it to my party! And I have a surprise for you! Close your eyes and don't open 'em until I tell you. [pulls the hut's roof down on top of Jake and waddles toward the manhole] [pants heavily] Finn? You lied to me? Yeee-ow! [the cast crumbles mostly away and he runs faster] [chasing him] What about my party? Don't go! Finn! Whup! [dives into manhole and lands in water] Hello? [gasps] [weakly] Finn... Surprise! Surprise! Suprise! You... you did this? I did this? Ow. [touches head] They've been waiting for me, Finn, for my b-day! Stop being crazy! [babbles] Oof. Yoo-a-hee! I'm a woman! I'm a woman! Mah! [punches him twice] Ring, ring! [as a woman] Eh, hang on, deary. [stretches a phone out of his arm] Hello? [as a man] Baby, I told you never to call me here! Wha... what happened? A deer skronked your head and you lost your mind, man! You imprisoned the Candy People for your own sick birthday fantasy. Look. [gestures to Candy People] What? No. It's not even close to my b-day! [takes Peppermint Butler down from the wall] I'm so sorry. [weakly] You... you did not do this, Jake. Wha—?! Then who did? It... was... him. [points to the stag] [gasp] Freak deer! [drops Peppermint Butler] [screams] Grrrr! Jake, you free the Candy People. I'll take on the deer. Naw-hyah! [punches stag] [weakly] Thank you. [gasps] [prepares to untie a cinder block] Finn! Huh? [looks up to see the cinder block falling] Donk! [jumps off the stag] [cheer] [high-five] Nice! We did it, dude! How's your noggin? Not crazy anymore! How's your legs? Hmm, still broken. [laughs] [laughs] Thank you for saving my kingdom, boys. The deer wanted our sugar, but I didn't give him any, if you know what I mean. [clicks tongue] [pause] Um... pyew! It's stanky in here! Yeah, like bad breath and eggs. Let's go home so we can get baths. I wanna get clean! Hey, how's it going up there? Have you made visual confirmation with Glob? [over radio] Shut... you... This is freaking har—! Come again? You're breaking up. Make sure you tell Glob it's me who sent you. Tell him we're coming for Grod, Grob, and Gob, also! I believe in you, little guy! You can keep your little guys in your—aarrgh! What the freak am I doing?! Come again? Nothing. Never mind. [gasps] Oh, crud. There... he... is! Who's that? Dark off. Whoa! I... got... you! [grabs Glob] Uh-oh, don't pass out, man. Hey, wake up. Hey. What? [watching through telescope] Pull up! Pull up! Oh, right. [laughs] I did it! I have your brother, Magic Man! It's " Yes... powerless... Normal Man. Bring him here, Tiny! No. Wh—Wh—Huh? What is this? It's a classic double-cross, bozo! Brother, tell this animal to put me back in space. You messed with me for years! Now it's my turn to mess with you! [laughs] Hey, Jake. You need help with demma Eggs Benedict inna demma hollandaise sauce? [looking out the window] Get over here, dude. Yo, no dogs on the table. Shoo! Get down, boy! [looking out the window]Whatcha see, boy? Show daddy. I do see something, but you're making it weird. Sorry bro. What's going on. [pointing] Look. Whoa. Hey, you! scram![Normal Man is shown sitting on [yelling] Yeah, beat it Magic Man! Oh, hey. Got him! [Looks unsure.] Uhh.. is he dead? Nah, he's magic. Dude, he lost his powers, remember? Oh, right. [a fly lands on Normal Man's face.] Uh-oh. Phew! Come on. Let's bring him inside, you murderler. Finn and Jake! I need your help! Why would we help you, Magic Man? It's [confused] Whaaaaaa? That's where Tiny Manticore took Glob -- to the very top of Wild Trap Mountain. Come on, fool! Come on. Get spanked! Tiny always liked you guys. That's because we freed him from your sick nightmare house. Maybe he'll listen to you and not hurt Glob. This could be my chance to make things right between us, go back to Mars and run things how we used to, before I threw everyone under the bus. Like when you made them all go bald or something? Magic Man, stop this nonsense immediately. Aah! Magic Man! As soon as I break these magic bonds, you're going straight to Ooo on that bus, you hear me?!  What's that? Oh, no! Aah! Just a few more laps and I'll break the jerk world record. You know what, guys? I'll just go up there and let Tiny margle me off a cliff. It'll be good for Glob to see his trash brother eat it finally. What do you think about that? No. Glob's your brother, and brothers always care about each other, even if one of them is a terrible deuce breakfast like you. So let's stretch up this thing and talk it out with Tiny. WAIT! It's called Wild Trap Mountain for a reason. Look. Normal-size manticores. Carnivore plants. Camouflage rock beasts. Mind-control parasites. Archer bandits that'll shoot you straight out of the sky. This one quiet dude nobody messes with. A dragon ghost. Red ants. Weekend survivalists. Waking dream demons. That squirrel that hates you, Jake. Who? We get it. We got to stealth it up there. Oh, ouch, my knees. Shh! [ Hey, Luke. What's going on today? Freaking nothing yet. I know. I just want to kill and eat someone already. Phew! Well, we got past those guys. Easy greasy. You doing okay, Normal Man? Easy grea‐‐ What? [Jake is seen being half-eaten by a carnivore plant]Aah! I know that voice! Charge! Surprise, you're dead![Normal Man throw a carnivore plant at the camouflage rock beast as it struggles and fell down the mountain] Go, go,go, go, go, go! Finn? Parasite! What the heck? To the top! Wait! [ Jake steps in front of Normal Man and Finn, stretching himself to shield them as the archer bandits fire at them. He yelps in pain, as he blow out, firing the arrows on his body at the bandits ] Almost there! [As the trio runs by the one quiet dude nobody messes with]Don't bother that guy. Wow. [ Get off my mountain! [On the ground, being attacked by a waking dream demon] Aah, my dreams! I'm having daymares! There's the top! [As the Squirrel jumps out from a tree] Jake! It's me! Who? My eyes! Sorry. [As he climbs up to the top of the mountain]Ahh! Tiny Manticore! Please! Don't hurt my brother! This guy is really freaking me out. Yes! Hello, Normal Man. Come and greet the dawning of your grimmest day! How ironic that you, who once trapped me, are now about to royally bite it. You stand at the mercy of my boomerang and flamethrower! I know I really messed you up, but Glob has nothing to do with this. Kill me instead. I'll let you do it. Why do you sound so insincere? That's just my voice. Normal Man's telling the truth. Yeah! Finn and Jake? I respect you guys a ton, but I have trained for this vengeance for months! I must seize this sparkling moment full in grasping hand! [ What's even a boomerang? [The boomerang flies back and hit Jake]Oh, my gosh. I've been calling them something different my whole life. I'm sorry, Jake! I'm just doing me right now. We're still cool, though? Not no more! Kick his tiny butt. Aah! Gah! I hate this mountain. Boomerang! [Finn was looking behind him at the boomerang that missed them] Watch out for when it [A second one hits him in the back of the head]‐‐Oof. Two boomerangs! Could it be? My moment approacheth? Steady hand, steady heart. Look out, dude. Whoa! Can I just have this? [ Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let go! We're going to fall. I'm not very big. I ‐‐ Uh...Okay. Upon reassessment, this is actually a great situation for me! [As he undoes the cloth holding Glob] Farewell, Magic Man! By my hand, I soar free! [Observing from the top of the mountain] Boy‐yay‐moy! Jake! [As he recovers from being knocked out] What? I'm coming! I got to save the dude. No planes! Never planes! Glob, are you okay? Why did you rescue me? I wanted to bring you back to Mars. They need a ruler up there, and I wanted to apologize for being such a beanshow for hundreds of years. Whoa. What? Maybe you really have changed. Yeah, right! I'm following to watch you die. You know what, though, Magic Man? I've been doing a lot of thinking up in orbit. I shouldn't have shut you out when you got exiled to Ooo. In some ways, I, too, was a total beanshow. I guess neither of us were perfect brothers. Although you were much, much worse. So, what now? Are we straight up just going to die? I guess so. Sorry. So, your profile said you were into music. That's crazy, so am I! It's stressing me out that there's food on a blanket! [Gets up and leaves]I have to go home. This was nice. You're running away from intimacy! You don't know you'd get hurt! Tiny? What are you doing? I could not go through with my vengeance. It wouldn't have accomplished anything. Also, you and your brother are really sweet together. You're hard to track. But okay! We'll get down ourselves, guys. Don't even sweat it! [Now at Normal Man’s house, with the Normal Man and Glob] But, yeah, let's hang out sometime. I'm getting a phone soon. Bye! Ready to go home? Whoa, dang. Oh, the people of Mars are gonna be so glad to see you. It really feels good to be good, you know? Maybe that's my new catchphrase. I don't know. Is that dumb? It's a good catchphrase. You'll do okay up there. [ Ahh! Glob, what are you doing?! My days of ruling Mars are over, but you got this, man. All right. Well... Oh, my Gob. Where were you? I was with Normal Man. He's cool now. Whaaaaa?I don't believe it. Hey, guys. I'm back. Magic Man! Oh! He came back! Oh, I can't believe it! It's okay. Calm down. Calm down?! You turned me into a giant starfish! You turned me into a barrel of flaming garbage! What horrible trick do you have planned now? I don't really do tricks anymore. Hmm. Okay. Here's a trick. [ I want to eat those brownies. It's a start. Ugh. I'm covered in noobs. T.V., 잘 지내니? (How are you?) [groans] I've got hunger cranks. Hmm? Oh, yes. That's very [bats Charlie's hair] interesting. Kim Kil Whan. [steps over him] Hm. Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrraahh! [closes laptop] Mom, when are we gonna eat?! I'm going nuts! T.V., 말조심해! (Watch your mouth!) Seriously, Mom, Dad's already three hours late with the food! You hush, Junior. You know Dad's a wonderful cook. Viola, when's the last time you even heard from Dad? Oh, you know. Dad is... distractible. [laughs] "Distractible"! Yeah, I love Dad and everything, but he's only ever met me twice. Charlie, Viola, T.V., Jake Jr., Kim Kil Whan, 제발! 너네 아빠가 너를 얼마나 보고 싶어하는데. (Please! Your dad really wants to see you.) [gasps] [laugh] Whoo! Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Yeah, yeah, yeah! We're real late! Happy birthday, puppies! Okay, so, putting it out there—I didn't remember to bring you guys any birthday presents, but I did bring lunch! [takes out a wad of macaroni and sets it on the ground] It's macaroni salad. Dad, you're beautiful! Dad! We have new business to discuss. Happy birthday, Kim Kil Whan. Birthdays are old business. [teleports Jake next to him] Whoa, neat. Um, well, how are things going, Son? "Things"? "Things" have switched hands. Heh. [gives thumbs up] I get it. Dad, when I say that things have switched hands, I mean to say that things you have previously claimed ownership of have transferred from your hands to my hands, in that... [conjures a briefcase containing a deed] I bought your tree house. What?! What the deed to your tree house. How acquired through legal trade. From whom the deed's previous owner, Marceline The Vampire Queen... [conjures Marceline] in exchange for one lunatic bass. When effective immediately. But, Son, why? We will convene at the property. [Teleports next to Finn and Jake, brushing dirt off his sleeve.] Sorry I'm late. Okay, so, as the deed-holder of this tree house I am now your landlord. [Pulls out cellphone from suit pocket and flips it open.] The first thing I'm going to have to do is assess your treasure room. [Closes cellphone and puts it back in pocket.] [Gets down on one knee in front of Kim Kil Whan.] But son! [Crawls to Kim Kil Whan.] What would your mother say? Doing this to your poor Pip-Pop! I'm sorry Dad. Deeds don't bleed. [Pushes away Jake, who rolls over.] [Opens front door of Tree Fort.] Okay son. Get ready to be glitter-stunned by all this treasu--Oh, yeah. We spent all of it. [Finn and Kim Kil Whan follow Woof. [He takes the photos and puts them in his suit pocket.] All right. [He gestures to the ladder leading to the second floor of the Tree Fort.] So I guess this is the apartment the two of you can afford. It's a ladder. [Cellphone rings, he answers it.] Yeah? Yeah. Send them on over. [Hangs up and puts cellphone away.] Sorry about that. [Clears throat.] Anyway, as you can see, this beauty offers direct first and second floor access. Superb craftsmanship and etcetera. I suppose you're familiar. [Finn raises his hand.] Yes, Finn? Yeah, uh, when are we going to get our house back? [Frowning] What? [Someone knocks on the front door.] Excuse me. [Walks to the door and opens it.] Good afternoon! Yes, right this way. [An assortment of characters walk into the Tree Fort] I've got 37 available units to show in this building so we're going to want to get right to it. Please step inside. [ [Night falls. Hey Finn. I'm real sorry about this. Somehow I feel like it's kinda my fault. Nah man. It's really not so bad. Let's just sleep on it tonight. [ You're gonna sleep... like that? Yeah, man. It's tough. I'm a tough kid. [Sighs and shrinks down so he fits onto the ladder rung easily.] I promise, I'll work this thi--Aaah! [A strange creature steps on Gee but it's great to be back home, eh Mr. B? [He steps on Finn's face, leaving a shoe print mark.] Haha, yeah. I can't wait to wash my gross, fat butt. [He drags his butt across Finn's face as he walks up the ladder.] [Stands up, making disgusted noises. He walks upstairs to the bathroom, passing sleeping tenants whose "apartments" are marked out by lines of chalk. He washes the shoe print off his face.] [Crouched by the toilet in fear, a cellphone held to his ear] Oh, oh holy cow. Oh, oh boy, please hurry. Yes, he's inside my apartment right now! Oh, I'm so scared! [Offscren] Hey buddy, you okay? Glob, now there's two of 'em! [Standing in the bathroom] I just feel if we're patient this whole thing will work itself out before you know it. [Sirens wail in the distance, their lights flashing through the bathroom window.] Haha! See, man? Help is on the way! Man, can I tell you something? I don't even know what's going on here. I mean like, what the heck is a deed? How come he can buy our house when it's OUR house and Marceline gave it to us and we live there?! A-and now we're arrested?! This is crazy! It's crazy!! [A Banana Guard walking by looks over at Man, don't you know? The laws ain't made to help earthy cats like us. They're not?! Nah, man. Listen. Here on our planet, back in the old days, back in the REAL old days, it was just every man for hisself. Scrooblin' and scrat-scroblin' for the good stuff, the greenest valleys, and scrat-scroblin'. And the strongest, meanest men got the best stuff. They got the green valleys and were like, "The rest of you, y'all scrats get sand!" And THAT'S when they made the laws, you see. Once the strong guys got it how they liked it, they said, "This is fair now, this is the law." Once they were winning, they changed the rules up. Woah, just like Kim Kil Whan! Hey, good news, fellas. [Unlocks Finn and Jake's handcuffs.] Your bail's paid. You're free to go. Haha, that's awesome! Yeah, awesome! Yeah. Real "awesome." Hey, Kim Kil Whan! Aw buddy, I knew you'd come around! [Jumps up and hugs Kim Kil Whan, hanging onto his body.] Haha, fathers and sons, man. That's that REAL thick chowder. [ This is a bill for the bail I just paid. [In shock at the amount.] Ooh. [ You're really in it deep here, Dad. It's time for you to get real, get a job. No more games. Come on, son! Just let me do the-- [Kim Kil Whan teleports away before [Sighs.] Man, where did I go wrong? I don't know. But I'm not tryin' to be sleepin' on a ladder anymore, so let's just get a bunch of scroot together and buy our house back. Then you two can hash it out later. [Finn and Well, actually...I was thinking maybe Kim Kil Whan was right. [ Oh yeah.... Yeah. Oh no, wait! I just remembered I buried a ton of gold in the front yard! Yuss!! [Scene changes to the tree house, where [The sound of [Turns back to the creature.] Excuse me. [He teleports away.] In the dark recesses of the mind, a disease known as FEAR feasts upon the souls of those who cannot overcome its power... Come back, thief! Whoa! Stop farting on me! It's gross! You can't just go around stealing boots. Yeah, and you know the penalty for stealing boots. It's poots... on newts. [Laugh] He's getting away in that lake! Dude, that isn't a lake. That's an ocean. [Laughs and runs after Jake] Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark! ...Huh? Uhh... [Laughing and farting on the Newt] Poots on newts! Poots on newts! No! [Slow-motion] Poots on newts! [laughs and starts removing his shoes] I'm coming, Jake. I'll poot on that newt as soon as I'm barefoot. Uh... [Breaths heavily, his stomach rumbles] Ow! Why is my stomach going nuts? Ow! Wh-wh-wh-Who are you? I am the manifestation of your fear... fear of the ocean! What? I'm not afraid of lakes, wells, or rivers, streams, or deep wells or puddles. Why would I be afraid of- [Screams and backs away from the water] [Laughs] 'Cause you're a wuss. I'm no wuss! I'm the hero around these parts! Ha! You're too scared of the ocean to ever be a true hero. Not true! I'm not scared of nothin'! [Shakes his head and takes a deep breath] I shall conquer my fear. Yeah, right. No! I will. I'll conquer my fear. Of course you will, [Receding back into Finn's navel] and I live in a two bedroom apartment that doesn't smell like vomit [Laughs] ...Sarcasm. Dude. Dude, did you see me? I was all like womp, and then I was all like take this! Womp! Womp! And then... Hey, what’s wrong with you, dude? Jake. I think I'm afraid... of the ocean. Say what, now? I need your help to overcome my fear. Will you do it? Um... No... I don't really wanna do it. Jake! Come on! I'm just messing with you. I'll do it. Hmm... Where to start? Oh, ok. I think we should just take a few steps in the water. You can hold Um... Oh it's ok, dude. I see the problem. It's just your feet. [Manually moving Finn's feet forward one at a time] Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop. Don't be scared. I shall not be scared. [Still moving Finn's feet] Boop. Boop. I'm afraid! Ah! [Jumps on top of Jake and starts punching him] Jake, get me out of the water! Now, Jake! Now! Now! Hot jam! You're really scared of the ocean. In fact, you're so scared... it gives me an idea. Let's start a business of being scared of the ocean! Jake! Ok. Ok. I have a plan to get rid of your fear. We'll start tomorrow morning. But I must conquer this now! [Runs towards the ocean screaming] I'm not afraid of you! [reels back in slow-motion and screams] [Running backwards] I'm afraid of you! I'm afraid of you! [Screams] [Exhaustedly crawls to Jake's feet] Ok, yeah. Let's try tomorrow. Fiiiinn. Finn. Hey, Finn. Wake up. [Opens his eyes] Morning, Jake. Ready for me to help you get over your ocean fear? Yeah, man. Cool... but I can only do this if you ask me. I'm askin'! Then get ready for my three-step plan. Watch your troubles melt away with step one! [Screams] Jake, are you crazy? This is not an OK thing to do! Hey. Hey. Come on. The ocean is your friend, and you got friends all around you right now. Miles and miles of friends. You're nuts. [Wriggles from side to side] Don't try to struggle, man. [Pulls the blankets back, revealing that Finn is tied to the bed] I'll let you out in a second. You just need to calm down. Really? Ok. I'm calming down. That's great. You're doing great. Ready for step two? [Breathing heavily] Yeah, man. I can do it. Alright, dude. Step... two! [Unties the rope] [Screams] Jake, this isn't a joke! It's touching me! Let it hold you, man! Let it hold you like a child! [Heart pounding] I'm trying to let it hold me. Control your breathing! [Breathes in and out] This isn't working! That means we gotta move to step three. Just don't scream. W-what? I'm gonna push you underwater with my jowls. Just don't scream. Don't scream. What?! Don't scream. Hold your breath, Finn. You got it, dude! Get me away, Jake! Now, Jake! Now! Right now! Get-Get me away! [Screams] Finn! Stop it, Finn! Ow! [Laughs] I'm safe! I'm safe! How'd I do? I think we should give up. What? I made it all the way to level three. Look, Finn. It's not that I don't want to help you... I just don't wanna get beat up anymore. I mean this [Pointing to his face] is my bread and butter. I can't have you messing up my bread and butter, dude. You have to help me. I can't do this without you. Ok. Fine... but only if you swear not to hit me anymore. I swear I won't hit you anymore. And also swear to only speak in rhymes. Speak in rhymes all the times. I swear... and pigs have hair. Yes. Perfect. And since you want more... it's time for step four. What? I thought you said it was a three step plan... man. I'm not that good at counting. [Laughs and grabs a small, rusty submarine] Come on. Let's go kick your fear of the ocean where the sun don't shine... in the sea cucumber. Check it, dude. One hundred percent awesome-itude. [Eyes closed, breathes heavily and shivers] Yeah. It's pretty math... you psychopath. You know, it looks way more math if you open up your eyes. [Opens his eyes] Whoa... See, man? The ocean is beautiful. There's no reason to be afraid of things that are beautiful. Hey. This isn't that bad. I'm actually glad. [Points] Hey, look! A black abyss! Let's go check it out... sauerkraut. No, Jake! Turn around! Turn around! Noooo! Saying, "Turn around" twice doesn't count as a rhyme, dude. Hey, you swore! Ow! My bread and butter! No, dude! Don't! Don't worry, dude. Everything's cool. This is the perfect segue into level five. [Handing Finn a dive suit] Here, put this on. Just make sure you don't pull the emergency tab. No, dude! I said don't... Jake? Jaaaaaake! Jake! [Laughs] Pathetic! You can't even overcome your fear now that your friend is about to die! Your un-heroic body will never let you save Jake. [Laughs] [Sadly] You're right. What? Really? You think I'm right? Well, that's... that's great! [Holding a wrench] If my body won't let me rescue my best friend, then there's only one thing left to do. No. Wait. No! Noooo! Jake! Jake! Wake up! You ok, dude? Yeah, man. Wait... Finn, you did it! You conquered your fear! What? You're at the bottom of the ocean! Maybe we should celebrate on land. I'm proud of you man. You did it! Thanks, dude. You've nothing to be proud of, boy! You will never get of your fear of the ocean! Whoa, dude! What's with your bellybutton? [To Fear Feaster] What the flip, man? I just swam to the bottom! No you didn't, cheater! You just sank to the bottom. You will never be a great hero. He's right. I'll never be a hero. Finn, you are wrong. The mark of a great hero is his flaw. You know nothing, Wise Men! Silence, Fear Feaster! We know a lot! Wait... Why did you wait so long to tell me? Because the limo driver's flaw is being late! Sorry. [rolls up window] Farewell, Finn. You truly are the greatest hero of Ooo. It's time for you to go away, Fear Feaster! What? Am I supposed to live in your tummy for the rest of my life? Everybody has a flaw... and it looks like yours is smelling like my nasty guts. [Sarcastically] Wonderful... And so fear is forced deep within the soul of a hero. Conquered... at least, for now... [Maniacal laugh] Yam! Yam! Nyam. Yam. [chuckles] That's right, you silly guards. Stay distracted, talking to each other. And when you least expect it, old [to Guard 2] It's not as bad as you— Hey, you two mugs, be on the lookout for rebels. Whoa! Nice. Time to enact my genius plan. [licks the large prisoner next to him] Huh?! [turns to Martin] [blows raspberry] [growls] Huh?! Here comes the rascal! [slips on the last prisoner's sweaty head] Whoa! [grunts] Whoa! [reaches for it] Nyam. Nyam. Hey. This is your rebel village? I am honored. [stomach growls] Uh, say, you dudes hungry? I'm a little peckish. Nyam, nyam? What's a fella got to do, right? Hey, wait a sec. Whoa! [slides down into crevice] Nice. Little bird family on vacay. Dad's got the mad beautiful tail feathers; Mommy's taking up the rear all plain-jane styles. [Mother bird farts] Hehe. Glad I get to date a beautiful rainicorn, not some nasty bird. [A messenger bird holding a package flies up to Hey! Don't be talking trash! Our ladies are beautiful on the inside, you creep. All lady birds around the whole world are beautiful on the inside? Yes. Fair enough. Special delivery for Jake the Dog. Hold still, BMO. Ouch. I hurt my butt sledding. Aw dang. Sorry, BMO. [Finally puts the tape in BMO and then quickly runs in front of him] Cool, man, I'm excited! [mumbling] [Stops eating peanuts] What the heck am I looking at? [shouting] Jake the Dog, we have your daughter. She is safe—for now. [Shakes BMO] [shouting] What do you want from me?! We need you to reassemble your old team—Gareth, a.k.a. The Lady Master, the Flying Lettuce Brothers, notorious con-men impressionists and your old friend, Tiffany. [quietly] Glob it. You'll need them to break in the Royal Candy Vault and steal this. The Baker's Shard—the purest source of sugar in the known regions. You're the only master thief with the skills to swipe it. You have until midnight to make the drop. Tell anyone and Jake Jr. gets it. [Tape stops playing] [Changes his appearance into a more sinister one] BMO, destroy the tape. Are we on the level, BMO? I ain't no clown-town snitch, baby. I don't want Finn hearing about this. Alright. [laughing] Oh Branard, you sure? Yup babe, I'm totally famous [with a darker tone] and you love me. Wha—what is going on? What am I feeling now? You are now under the spell of my face. I got you, girl, in my face trap and you love it. I do. Branard, don't ever leave me! I'll give you everything—my fabric, my dress patterns, my marbles, my social standing— [Gets interrupted by Gareth's watch] [Sees Jake's picture on his watch] Woops! I gotta go! Laters! Dine and dash? I saw that! Hey boss, I wanted to— Shut up Tonya, I gotta see my ex-wife! [Breaks the entrance door of the Squeeze-E-Mart and leaves] Uh. [Answers the phone] Hello, Squeez-E-Mart. [imitating the Squeez-E-Mart boss' voice] Tonya, this is your boss! Wait, you were just here. Yeah, and now I'm on the phone, stupid! Hey, do you think I can leave early? I'm like, depressed. What you could do is take all the money from the register and give it to the two guys out back by the dumpster. [signs] OK. Can then I go? Yes. [Cover their faces with a newspaper] [Leaves the Squeez-E-Mart and hands the money to the brothers] Here you go dudes. Thanks, man. [with a darker tone] Peace. Goodbye, fair lad. [Notice their watch beeping] The master returns. Well, well. From the shadows of dream, the dog wakes to find its—ugh—[Checks what's written on his arm]—the dog wakes to find its mangy tail flopping in the dust like a fish in a tree. That fish is me! [Turns on the lights and sees the gang] Oh, hi guys. Were you waiting for me in the dark? Tiffany wouldn't let us turn them on. Never mind that, the real question is what's that slo-mo Finn know about this? Hey BMO, where's Jake? Jake got back with his old gang and is going to rob the Candy Kingdom! [laughing] OK, BMO. [giggling] You wanna join my primitive noise band? [Plays trumpet] No, I like organized sound. Pssssh! [ Nah, BMO's covering for me. So what's the deal, Jake? Yeah, why did you call us back? I got a job for you guys. [They gather around him] One last score. The Big one. The Baker's Shard? [Laughing] Are you for real, man? This is crazy Jake, we always said "Play it safe." Can't ya see guys, he's desperate! Somebody got to him 'cause he's soft now. What? Psssh! Tiffany! I'm the same I don't want to do poetry—I mean, pottery. Dude, you guys on board or what?! You really got something better to do?! I know you don't, Tiffany! [rough voice] Glom you, Jake. How are gonna split the Baker's Shard? We ain't keeping it. [the three grow shocked looks] I'm passing the shard off to a mystery dude. [angrily] What the—?! The dude has my kid. [Tiffany goes from angry to a mix of surprise of empathy] My Little I'm in. We're in. I know that vault inside and out! Every guard rotation, every camera, every deadly trap. And that safe is locked up so tight it makes me wanna spit out my guts and cry about it. Do you even have a plan, Jake?! I have the first part. [Raises hand] OK, let's freakin' do this! [Sees a milk van arriving] Captain, the milk delivery has arrived. Well, check 'em in, Private. Yes, sir! [Goes towards the door] And Private, I'm very thirsty! Bring me back the most delicious flavor they have! Yes sir! [Leaves the room] Huh? Now what in the heck—?! I got your milk, sir! What flavor did you bring me, Private? [imitating the Private's voice] Banana, sir! What? Banana milk! [Throws it in his face] [screaming] The forbidden flavor! It's—delicious. [Trying to imitate the Captain's voice] It's—it's—it's—it's—delicious! [talking on the speaker] Attention all guards! You are directed to report immediately to the courtyard for special training! [Opens his chest, revealing Tiffany is hidden in there] OK, do your thing, man. [Holding a dynamite] Just like old times, right, Jake? When we were blood, we'd follow each other in the jaws of death on a pale horse. Not now, Tiffany! Come on! [Gets Tiffany out of his chest] [imitating the Captain's voice] Tonight we'll be working on our battle "kee-yahs." Alright men, sound off! [They look on their watches] Alright soldiers, time to shred those pipes! I wanna hear you scream! Louder! Push it hard! [coughing] [They get close to the door and open it] The Baker's Shard is on the other side of—that. The Corridor of a Thousand Deaths. I did it! For Stop right there. You! Where's my daughter?! Throw me the Baker's Shard—and I'll let her go. Yeah right, that's super-dumb. Daddy! Please do what he says! Hang on, sweetie! [Throws the Baker's Shard, which is caught by Gareth] [imitating Jake Jr. voice] Thank you for saving me— —daddy! [laughing] [gasp] You dirty— Now—ugh—[Checks what's written on his arm]—I'm the dog, and you're the tail! Now you chase me! You chase my dreams! [pulls a lever through which an alert is set off] Oh crud! Jake, I love you! I love youuu! Shut it, Tiffany! [Sees the driver] Gimme my daughter. TADA! I totally double-crossed you!  Let's get out of here! What the funky fresh, honey? I just wanted to be like you. Mom told me stories about when you did crimes. [Scolding tone] That was a long time ago. Before I knew it was wrong! I thought you'll be proud of me. [Sighs loudly and turns his forehead back to normal] I am. I couldn't have done that when I was your age. I age fast remember? I'm twenty-two! R-r-r-right. I keep forgetting maths. What are you going to do about the old crew? Finn and I bust their apples tomorrow. Or maybe the Banana Guards will get 'em. [Grows large again] Come on. I'll take you home now. [Jumps on Jake's giant arm] I love you, pops. I love you, too. Don't stinkin' do this to me again. I'm old and fat. I'll probably have a heart attack. OK. [Stops] Wait a minute! You're doing a long con right now, aren't you? No. Yes. Now I'm really proud of you! [grunting] It's slippin', dude. Phew. [reading title] Raini-corni-copia? An Unabridged History of the Rainicorns. [yawns] Whatever, man. I barely even made it through the title. Listen, man. One day, I'm probably gonna have half-rainbow pupsters. I gotta be able to share my babies' culture. [mumbling indistinctly as he reads] Huh. [goes under the table] Oh. [comes out from underneath it] Hey, this table is wobbly. We gotta take it to the Lost Tinker Goblin of Fog Mountain to fix it. Dude, I would love to go on some crazy, made-up adventure with you, but I really gotta read this. So from here on out, I'm just gonna ignore you. [continues reading and mumbling] I don't make up adventures! Jake, you know that! Jake! I don't make up adventures! [lifts and drops the end of the table a few times] Hm. [leaves Jake and walks past some shelves] Books, books. [reading titles] Kitties, Zitties, Witties, Mitties, Knitties, Fitties, Hitties, Jitties, Pities, Cities... [comes to some books with damaged spines] Oh, no! Damaged books? Who did this?! Shhhhhhhushh! Sorry. [to books] I will avenge thee, slightly-soiled books. Gotta tell Jake. Hello? [looks behind books] Is someone back here? Are you stuck? Shhhushmm! [quietly] Hello? [pages start coming out of the books] Whoa! Ohhh! Hey, there's pages comin' outta these books! SHHHHHH! Who are you dudes? We are the I am I'll call you Pete. Okay! Why are you dudes in the library? We are the secret guardians of the books in the library. You know those blank pieces of paper in the beginning of old books? Yeah? That's us! We revealed ourselves to you, noble giant, because you felt our plight when you saw the damaged books. And now is our darkest hour, for the Moldos have been growing more bold with every attack. Look at the damage done yesterday [pulls out a damaged book] at the Battle of Teddy Bear Joke Book. Wow, yeah. They're massing for a full-scale assault on every book in the library! Gosh! Even the Rainicornicopia? Yes. I better tell Jake. Don't you dudes go anywhere. Okay. Hey, bro, I've got an adventure—and it's not made up! There are these- these Pagelings they came out from- from books! And they- they folded into little animals. Do you hear what I'm saying?! [shakes head] Shhhh! You think I'm making this up? [nods] [motions for Finn to go away] I'll prove it to you! [drags the Rainicornicopia off the table onto the floor and starts dragging it away] Finn! [following Finn] Finn, you butt chicken! Jake, wait till you see 'em. Ow. [grunts and strains as he lifts the Rainicornicopia and drags it back] They were just here! Pagelings? Why didn't you dudes introduce yourselves to Jake? We don't want to reveal ourselves to anyone else. We are the secret guardians. Secret. Ummmm... yeah, but Jake is a powerful giant like me! He can help you battle or- or whatevs! But first, you must win his favor. Do you not want victory for your people? Yes! We do want victory! C'mon, follow me. [he leads them to Jake] Jake, look. [to Pagelings] He's up here reading a book. Do something to get his attention. Very well. We shall dance as flowers. Hoo-ah! Okay. [grunt and sing indistinctly as they dance] Jake, the Pagelings are dancing for you. Just look up for a second! Finn, all the little voices you're doing are cute, but come on, man! Just let me read. [buries his face again] By wearing the beast, [they rip off some fur] we shall become like the beast. [they place the fur on their heads] You can feel them, can't you? I can feel you pinching me. Just look up for a second! [trying to lift up Jake] Looooook. [gives up] Uhhh. Pagelings, I'm sorry, but my friend is acting like a clump. Okay. We can't wait any longer. We must go back to the bookshelf to prepare for the Moldos' attack Yeah, go play make-believe somewhere else! I'm not making believe! [gasps] We were gone too long! Wield, my brethren. Wield! [battle cries] [yawns and exhales, blowing the Moldos and Pagelings off their feet] You win this battle, but next time, we will win. Yes, leave! Victory! Veni, vidi, vici! So, those little squishy guys are the Moldos? Aye. This was but a reconnaissance squad... sent to test our mettle! Mettle! Uh-huh. They seem tough. Their bites sting like the Dickens. Hmmm... their bites sting, eh? I've got a plan, Pete. Tell me your plan, giant. Just trust me. [picks up Paper Pete] Trust me. You've discovered the Moldos' Secret Lair! Eh, it wasn't very hard. Wibba-wibba-wah! The Pagelings have a battle beast! Attack! [battle cries] Whoa. Whoa, moldy blobs. I've come here to help the Moldos defeat the Pagelings. Traitor! [brandishing paper sword] Hiyah! Yah! [quietly] Calm down, this is part of my plan. Ohhh, ha-ha! Then I shall play along, wise giant. [winks] How are we to trust you? Well... here, look. [takes Paper Pete off his shoulder] I brought you all a prisoner. It's their leader. May you rot in Tartarus! May your skin boil and eyes burst into flames... forever in a pit! [winks] [winks] Traitor! So, do you guys have, like, a—like, a leader or somethin'? [murmuring and whispering] Mildwin. Mildwin. I'm Oh, uhh... hmm. [gets down on the floor] Nice to meet you, your highness. I'm not a king; I was democratically elected. [laughs] That's adorable. [beat] Now, Protect the elected official! Well played, ol' giant. [winks] You have the cunning of Odysseus. [winks several times] Pete, j-just stop winking. [jumps on top of a table and onto bookshelf] Hyah! Shhhh! Ignore this! [throws the Moldos at Jake] Hmm? Mmm! This tastes delicious! [chomps on a bit of Jake's flesh] AAAAH! AAH! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! What did you do to me?! AAAAAAH! Ummm... AH! AAAH! Uhhh... come on, you guys, knock it off. [hisses at Finn] The Moldos got a taste for ya now. [screams in pain] Gotta do something. Where can I find ways to solve problems in a library? [sees a poster] "Books"? [gets a book and starts hitting Jake with it] Books! Books! Books! Aaah! [sees a Moldo eating his shirt] Huh? Whatcha nibblin' me for? This sweaty stuff tastes amazing. A-mazing! Hmmm. Tastier than battle beast fur. Yis! [takes off his shirt] Hey, Mildwin. Mildwin! What? I bring a peace offering from the Pagelings. Hmm? Finn... what's happening? Hang on, buddy. Paper Pete? Giant! Have you wiped out the Moldo horde? Naw, man. The war's over. [pokes Mildwin] Mildwin, you can keep my shirt if [points to Paper Pete] you don't attack their library books. Agreed, beast. This filthy garb will feed my people for generations. And in forty years, you can have my shorts. Sound good, Pete? It will suffice. Sound good, Jake? [pulls the remaining two Moldos off his eyes] AAAH! What—What the hecks, man?! What'd you do to me?! [holds up his shirt] Look, man! Moldos and Pagelings are real! Wha—? Who cares, man?! I'm outta here! Did you finish your Rainicorn book? Ugh... I was readin' the same paragraph over and over for, like, eleven minutes. I guess I'm gonna give up on learnin' everything about Rainicorn history. Don't tell Lady. Oh. What about relating to your mixed-species kids? Eh, I'll just fake it. Oh. Well... hey, man, I think I see some, um... [points to the sun] Sun People in trouble on the sun over there. You makin' that up? Mmhmm. Yeah! Let's do it! [starts running toward the setting sun] [follows Jake] WHOO! WHOOOO! [laughs] Loot, bro! Gear dumped, bro! [They run upstairs.] How about this room, bro? [looks around] Looks like a brolicious room to relax in and play video games... bro. Home, sweet home, bro. [from behind curtain] Yeah, you said it. I've been home this whole time. [groans] [whispering] I keep forgetting that he lives here now. [whispering] Just until Gunter finishes rebuilding the Ice Kingdom. What y'all whisperin' about? [jumps onto the couch between Finn and Jake] Hehe! Ex-"squeeze" me. [puts his arms around them] [normal voice] Ice King, we've told you a thousand times this couch ain't for cuddlin'. Sure it is. It isn't! Mm, it's cozy. [normal voice] It's not that bad, Jake. See? [groans] Finn, can I speak to you in the kitchen? Oh, hey, Jake, can you bring me a sandwich? [whistles] Sandwich? It's time to kick Ice King out!! [signs language meaning that Ice King needs to go away] [pointing to Finn] Don't forget the bread! Haha! [to Jake] Look, I hear you. But we can't kick him out because I still feel guilty about junking up his crib. Hey, what if we check him into a hotel room? Hmmm? [signs language to Finn] What's that? Checking him to a hotel room. Oooh! Sandwich time! [Eating the sandwich] Hey, Simon, how would you like to stay in the Coolest Hotel? Lumpy Space Princess stays there. That's how cool it is. We'll even put you up for few weeks until your place is ready. Ahh, but that sounds lonely. I just like to stay here with you guys! Having roommates is nice! It keeps me out of my head. Gunther says only "Wenk!" What's up with that? Hehe, yeah? Finn, I'm ready to murder the Ice King. No. I-I have another idea. Oop. [eats the cocoa from his belly] Oh, my gosh! Someone's at the door. We have a doorbell now. We'll get it. Abracadaniel?! What are you doing here? [keeps his voice loud so Ice King can notice] What? You kept calling and call... [mouth has been covered by Jake's shape-shifting ears.] Hahaha! Shut up-up-up-up-up, Abracadeez! Yeah, man! You don't even need a reason to stop by! [keeping his voice loud] A sexy wizard like you goes where he wants! [sneaks in] Whoa-oh! I see what's going on! What... You do? [faces Ice King] Yeah! This wizard donk [points to Abracadaniel] is trying to jack my Tree House styles, just 'cause he beat me that one time at Wizard Battle! And if he takes one step closer, I'll bust him up one real good! I never asked to be... [sobs and slides under the curtain to his room] [to Abracadaniel] Come on, dude, we got cookies and the cocoa! [takes him to the living room] [laughing] Dang! But you're funny, Abracadaniel! I didn't say anything. [continues laughing] Fantastic. Hey, Abadabs! [holding a plate full of cookies] Why don't you show us that trick you're working on! [Ice King peeks] Oh? Uhh. Yeah! I suppose I could! [takes out his wand] "Shirmo lock kanta Floriana" [grows a flower from the floor with his stick] So good! Whoo! [with a cookie in his teeth] You're a good wizard! I don't know, it's dumb! I'm still working on it! It's-It's nothing! Oh, you're right that ain't nothing! Check out this wizar! [turns the flower into a giant ice sculpture of a  flower] Whoa! [the sculpture disintegrates and it snows] What? [amused] Ohh! You're the greatest wizard ever! Well, maybe not ever ever! Am I the greatest wizard in our generation? Yes. [pats Abracadaniel's head] [sips his coffee] This was a great idea, man! It's like he's forgotten all about us! Uhh-huh. Pretty soon, he'll be outta here for good. For good! [breathes a sigh of relief] Yeah! [screaming out of nowhere] Finn!! Jake!! Come quick!! It's an emergency!! Hurry!! [he and Abracadaniel are giggling. The light is off. Finn and Jake climb down.] Ice King? What's up? [Ice King turns on the light] Huh? What the flip? Tada! How'd they get the other couch down here? There you are, sir. There you are. [gives tickets to Finn and Jake that say "Abraca-Ice King Wizard Revue -Tonite- A3/A4" with a lightning bolt on the left side and a flower with a rainbow at the end of it on the right side] Right this way. You made it! Caw! Tada! [claps] [laughs] A bird! He's a bird! I've always been into interpretive dance. But I've never been able to find a musician who could match my energy until now! [Ice King gives some exquisite drum sounds. Huh! He's actually not bad! [humming] [stands up. He starts to dance] Dance party! [goes to the stage. He continues humming] No! [pushes BMO off the stage] Awww! [begins to hum and dance again on the stage] No! [pushes BMO again, only harder] Ow! [angrily kicks Abracadaniel] No! Ow! Why are you doing this?! You pushed my whole body! Um, [claps] whoo! That was great, guys! Yeah? You guys liked it? Well, then the second and third acts are gonna knock your socks off! Uh, [stands up, including Jake] actually, Jake and I have got, uh, got some stuff to take care of. Yeah... [looks at his shape-shifted clock] It's getting pretty late. Uh... oh, Glob. 'Sup, ABD? I just remember that I'm, uh, a-allergic, uh, to, to the night sky. You're afraid of the dark? Yes, if I ever had to walk, uh, outside at night, I might die of-of... [whispering so quietly that Finn and Jake can't hear him] Of fright. Of fright! Gee. Well, I guess you can crash here for the night. All right! [high five] Sleepover!! Wait! Are you really afraid of the dark? Maybe. Okay. Well, you can sleep on the couch. We're gonna go. Uh, good night. [climbs up, including Jake] [shocked] Whoa! See, I told you! Isn't it awesome? Eh, since I'm pretty much in charge here, we can totally take all this treasure if we wanted to. Ha! Totally! Wow! Cool! [looks at a toy] Oh, that's just a byncomire. Ohh! Wanna see something really cool? Yeah! Okay, but you gotta promise not to freak out! This is Joshua the Dog's Demon Blood Sword. [gasps] Yeah! It's a real demon blood sword. What?! And you see these words? [points to the words on the handle] If you say them out loud, you can actually see a vision of the demon whose blood was used to make the sword! No way! That sounds awesome! Too bad neither of us can read Demon Runes. Ooh! I know how! Butyrum lac surepo kee oth pradium, like that! Oops. Wow! It looks so real! I am real! Bring me the true bearer of my blood sword or I will destroy you both! Come on, best friend, [puts his crown on] let us not betray Finn! Let's fight Kee-Oth ourselves! Nobody can defeat us if we work together! Super Wizard Team Up! You're wasting your powers on me. Haha! Oh! No! Oh, no! He's too powerful! Kee-Oth! Joshua! Kee Oth Rama Pancake... Don't say another word, Joshua! Or the throats are going to get it! If you speak the words to banish me, I'll reduce your friends to ash! Kee Oth Rama P... [Finn covers his mouth] Dude!! I thought he was bluffing. I'm not bluffing, Joshua! If you do not willingly return my stolen blood, I will destroy him [faces Abracadaniel] and him. [faces Ice King] Ahh! The sword! Scary! I just can't do it, Jake. This is Dad's sword! You don't have any other choice! Do it! Do it!! Whoa. You got your blood, now get outta here! [chuckles] All right, I'll go. Psych! Got you now, Joshua! [takes Jake. He starts laughing and vanishes] [scratching his back] Uh, hey, so, uh, I should be getting home. [scratching his back] Uh, yeah, me, too. Hey, Abracadaniel, wanna hang out at my place? I thought your house broke.  Jake? You got that cooler, buddy? Yup! Good, 'cause we're gonna need it for this... ROOF PARTY! [Camera zooms out to show party; everyone cheers.] Watch this, everybody! Triple flip with chips for the dip! [Does a triple somersault and throws the bag of chips into a bowl] Watch this, everybody! A cooler! With stuff... for the thing! [Accidentally drops cooler and laughs, embarrassed. Everyone cheers; someone says "Party!"] Finn, you always focus an endless amount of energy on everything you do. What about me? What do I focus my energy on, Cinnamon Bun? Uh, Jake... you don't really focus at all. Huh? [Pushes down toaster lever] I said you don't FOCUS AT ALL! Hey, Finn, do another flip. [Does so] YUP! YAH! Hahaha!! You're a dynamo, Finn!! YEAH!! I NEVER SLOW DOWN!! "Never slow down?" Whoa. Dude, can you, like, get offa' me? [Does so] Do you think your energy could be used to power a huge machine? I guess so, man. [The stranger chuckles deviously and backs away slowly. I thought he was your friend. It's starting, everyone! The celestial alignment! [Full of energy] Jake! That party was super fun! [Bounces on bed] Man, I'm sleepy. [Yawns] Then go to sleep, man! Huh? Oh, yeah, right. [Walks to his bed yawning] Goodnight, homie. [Stops bouncing] Hyump! Ahh! [Blows out candle] Goodnight, hamlet. [Exhales sleepily] Hrrnf!! Ahh... What? [Stomach rumbles.] Alright, alright, you old gut. [Stretches] Oh, I'm sluggin' it today... [Rolls out of bed] Wake up, Finn. Got a busy day ahead of us. Finn? Hmm. Hmmmmm. Welcome, Finn. Huh? [Turns in the direction of the voice; his face is uncovered and he spits out a potato.] UNTIE ME SO I CAN BEAT YOU WITH THAT SACK!! [Stranger reveals himself and chuckles; Yes, the charismatic stranger from last night! Also... [Reveals himself to be three Gnomes] the Grand Master of the Gnomes! Hup! Hup! Hup! And... [Room lights up a bit] ruler of the Beneathaverse! [Casually] 'S pretty nice. Hey, why don't you guys just untie me, and we can pretend this whole thing didn't happen? Oh, no! I've been searching all over Ooo for the perfect power source! A living dynamo! Something that... never slows down. Uh-oh. And last night, I finally found— [Deadpan] It's me. Yes!! It's you!! You will have the great honor of powering the Upturnoverdrive! That does what now? It will flip over the entire world! Then we'll be the ones on top, buddy! THAT'S BIZONKERS! Yes, but the engineering is very sound. [Picked up by four Gnomes] Huh? Your energies will be harnessed by our most advanced technology. The Cyclonic Rodentarod! Ha! You may have captured me... Hugh! [Forces his hands in front of him] ...but you can't make me run! [A Gnome shocks But shakin' it's all I know! Shhh... Let me show you how it's done! [Starts dancing; the beetle joins him] Aw, yeah! Huh-hah! Yeah! Whoo! Congratulations. You fully charged the Alternator! Now it's time to power up the Plasma Ball... with sexy, fun dancing! NO! STOP! NOOOOO!!!! WHA! AAH!! [They throw Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Aaaaah... [Gulps the shake down] Whooooo! [Bugs cheer.] Whoooo! Any more grass shakes, Simon? All finished. Okay. I've got a joke. What did the mermaid... sea? A movie? Wh-...What? Oh! I messed it up! But it's still funny, right? WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, NO, IT'S NOT!! Y'all are horrible at tellin' jokes. Lemme hitcha with this. Didya hear about the goblin who got his left arm and left leg cut off? Um... no... Now... for the final stage! [Laughing] The brain machine!! YES! THIS MACHINE WILL SUCK THE ENERGY FROM YOUR THOUGHTS! [Switch to Finn's POV] ...To start our Upturnoverdrive. [Panting] Don't think, NOOOOO!!! Jake?!?! Ahahahaha! It's working! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Yeah! [Laughs] Yeah! [Laughs] Man this party is nuts! How'd I even get up here?! You blacked out after laughing so hard at your own jokes. You were off the hook! So we took you to the Cloud Kingdom to party with the Party God. Whoa! Who's the Party God?! I am the ...Oh. Jake... you have won my favor for being a completely off-the-hook party dog! [Howls] Hahaha! And because your gut waves please me so, I will grant you one wish! What do you want most in the world? "What do I want most?" [Chuckles] ...What do I want most in the world? Well... I wish Finn would stop leavin' his dirty— [Gasps, in realization] FIIINN!!!! I was on his trail...! And then I... got distracted...!! GAAAH!! What's wrong with my brain?! Cinnamon Bun was right... I can't focus on NOTHIN'!! Party God, I wish that I could focus on finding my friend Finn! Then your wish is my... WAIT, wait... Is there some kinda catch? Uh... [Hesitantly] Y-y-y-yes, y-y-you got me. ...To grant your wish, I will have to fill you with the energy of a thousand partying demons! You will become so overloaded with party energy that you will demolish everything in your path!! [Blasts Jake with a beam from his mouth] Must... find... Finn! Must... must...! PARTY FOREVEEER!!! [Flies away] It's working! It's working!! AHAHAHAHAH!! PAAAAAAARTAHAAAAAAY!!! [Crushes all of the Gnomes when he reaches the Beneathaverse.] PAAARTAAAY!! STEP BACK, EVERYBODY! I'M GONNA SHAKE IT! UNH! UNH! YOU FEELIN' THIS?!? Fire the shootey gun-ray!! HIGH-FIVE!! [Smashes gun] Freeze!! LET'S KICK IT!! [Kicks Gnomes away; he also kicks the Cyclonic Rodentarod, which bounces into the Plasma Ball, destroying it. The resulting explosion forces Finn's chair off its platform.] Wha?! HAH-HAH! [Pointing at the Upturnoverdrive] I BET I CAN LIFT THIS THING!! [Tries to lift it, and the machine overheats.] WAAAAHH!!! Jake?! [Turns around] JAKE!!! [Runs towards him] You defeated the Gnomes!! I did?! Yeah, man!! And you're okay?! Yeah, man, I'm fine!!! Haha! Then I did it! I saved you by being an unfocused, rowdy party dog! Hahaha, yeah, dog!! [Prostrates and Finn gets on his back] Hahaha! Yeah! [Stretching towards the exit] Let's go eat Cinnamon Bun! Calling all curlys! [muttering] Donkin' Princess... [through a megaphone] Okay, okay. How about I give you a big cowboy hat? Then will you let the hostages go? [exits store] No... no! [brandishing cudgel] Don't play games with me, Princess. I want that crown. No crown, no hostages. Well, obviously that's going to be a problem, because I'm the princess and I need my crown. So... No, Princess! You are problem—the problem princess! [beat] Just gimme that crown! [goes back inside] Why does he want your crown anyway, Princess? Yeah, what's his beef? I don't know, guys—he's crazy. He's left me no choice. I'm sending in the banana guards. It's about to turn crazy nasty. [raises a walkie-talkie to her ear] Hello. Captain Banana Guard? [taking the phone] Wait a second, Princess. Why don't me and Finn just sneak in there incognito and neutralize the threat, old-fashioned spy guy-style? Hmm. Okay, but if you guys aren't out of there by [points to her watch] 400, I'm sending in the guards. [to Finn] Okay, I was thinkin' I could [shape-shifts to look like a mailman] dress up like a mailman. Yeah. Yeah, and I could wear all black and I could be like, you know, like, your shadow. Hmm. I can't really see that working. Yeah, the shadow thing might be pushin' it. Oh, no-no-no, that part's fine. I was talking about you dressing up like a mailman. What? But I always wanted to be a mailman. Nah, you don't look like a mailman. You look like a milkman. Let's get you a proper milkman outfit. You ready? Yeah. Let's bust it. Hello. "Hello"?! Who the heck are you? [waving cudgel] I'm gonna smash your face. Uhh, milkman, sir. I brought the milk—for the hostages, sir. Huh? Oh. I thought maybe you were a spy guy or somethin'. Go ahead, give everyone some milk, then get the math outta here. Yes, sir. [starts passing out bottles of milk to the hostages] Milk, sir? Thanks. Milk? Thanks. Milk? Thank you. [to Upside-Down Ice Cream Cone] Some milk? Psst! Get ready, Jake. When we get to the cookie, you throw some milk in his face and yell, "Alvin's hot juice box. Alvin's hot juice box." He'll be really confused, and that's when we grab him and tie him up-style. [over radio] Come in, Cookie. This is Go ahead, Chipper. Over. I'm too short to lock the back door. Over. Hold tight, Chipper. Chipler's on his way. [turns around and strains, popping a chocolate chip out of his back] You got that, Chipler? Affirmative. [jumps away] Did you hear that? Yeah. Change of plans—I'll go take care of those chips. You keep the cookie distracted. Yeah. I can do that. Okay, awesome. Milk? Milk? [approaches Cookie] Milk? [sits next to him] Some milk? What? Oh. Look, you should probably split, buddy. Things are about to get pretty flipped out in here. Oh, sure. Sorry, man. I was just trying to get away from that rotten Princess Bubblegum for a while, y'know? Isn't she just the worst? Wait, you hate Princess Bubblegum, too? Get outta here! Oh, yeah, man, she's the worst. Sittin' out there all safe and cozy while I'm riskin' my life tootin' around in here in this stupid milkman costume. [beat] Wait—costume?! Oh, um... I just mean it feels like a costume... 'cause I wanted to be a mailman so bad, ya see? But the princess—she made me be a milkman anyway. Boy, I hear ya, brother. [over radio] Cookie, you there? Over. Yeah. Go ahead, Chipolina. Over. I just saw a light go on in the stock room—probably nothing. I'll check it out. Over. Okay. Over. Hmm. [walks up to it] [to radio] Looks like a false alarm, Cookie. It's just some kid's Baby Snuggleghost nightlight. Hee-yah! [kicks it away] [as he falls] Alvin's hot juice box! Alvin's hot juice— [lands on Chipolina] So what's your story, man? How'd she doodie on you? [sighs] I was just a kid, man, just a little kid, when I got doodied on. I was the new guy at the Candy Orphanage. They called me Baby Snaps. I tried to make friends with the other kids... [dancing] C'mon, guys, let's dance it up! They were always too depressed to play. No, no. We're too depressed. Things went on like that for a while, then... one day... [Peppermint Butler opens the door to the orphanage for Princess Bubblegum] she showed up. [The candy orphans laugh and dance around the chair in which Princess Bubblegum is sitting and reading "Baby Whoozlefut & the Wuttlebugs" aloud.] Everything was different. ...a thunderous cheer [turns page] as Baby Whoozlefut... Everything was-was better with her around. And something inside me changed that day, too. And then later she told me I could be anything I wanted. Anything your sweet heart desires! And I told her I wanted to be a princess like her, so I could make all the children happy. [on Princess Bubblegum's lap] I wanna be a princess like you! [stifles a giggle] And she laughed in my face, man! It really messed me up. Holy shmow, man. That's terrible. That's really terrible. Listen, I— [cries] She LIED to me! Yeah, but, maybe she didn't realize how much it meant to you. [stands up] No, she just wants to hog all the princessin' for herself! [to radio] All chips, report in. It's time to get real! Over. [no response] Chips. Chips. Over. [no response] Chips! Where are my chips?! Chipolina! Chipler! Chipton! Chipper! Is anyone there?! Chipface? Something happened to my chips! [smashes radio on the ground] AAAAH! [pants heavily] I'm about to flip out, man... and take that crown! Whoa, whoa, wait! It doesn't have to be like this! You don't need that crown. You could start over, man. You can start a new kingdom—your own kingdom... where everyone can be whatever they wanna be. I can be the mailman... and you? You can be the princess. And— My own kingdom? Yeah, man. I... I'd like that. Okay, then. Just sit tight, Princess. I'll get us outta here. [walks to the front of the store and waves through the glass doors.] Hey! Hey! I'm comin' out! What? Jake? Jake, what's going on? Where's Finn? Where are the hostages? Don't worry, Princess. It's okay now. Princess Cookie's gonna go away. You just gotta give him a horse to escape with and he'll go. Right... and then you and Finn hunt him down and put him in the dungeon. No, wait. He said he'd go away forever. Can't we just let him go? No. That cookie is a menace. Once the hostages are safe, Cookie goes in my dungeon—in my dungeon for his life. [sighs] Oh, boy! Would ya look at that? Dang! Okay, well... she's all yours! Hot diggity! [starts walking toward it] [holds him back] Ah-ah-ah! Man, that horse ain't no good; that's a trap horse. What are we gonna do? It's okay, man, I'm Whoa! Ha HA! You're magic! After them! [laughs] We're really doing it! Jake! What are you doing?! What happened to the plan? New plan—I'm gonna help Princess Cookie escape. What? But-but he's a criminal! No, man, Princess Cookie's a good guy. He just got dealt a bad hand. He's only trying to be what following how his dreams make you want to be, man! Whaaaat? You're either with us or against us. Um... 'gainst? [Jake pushes him off.] WAAAH! Oof. [laughs] [still laughing] Hold on tight, Cookie! I'm gonna jump the gorge! No, Jake. Stop the horse. [still running at full tilt] I can make it! Princess Cookie! Are you all right? I'm done for, Jake. No, everything's gonna be fine. I won't let them put you in the dungeon. Just let me talk to them. [runs off] No, Jake. Thank you for your help, but it's too late for me. [stands up] I'll never be a princess. At least for a moment, you helped me feel like a princess. It was wonderful. [sheds a tear] Thank you, Jake. Careful, Princess! You know what? It's funny, but you sort of remind me of a mailman I used to know. [softly] I do? Yep. [lets himself fall backwards into the ravine] [looks over the ledge] Princess! I glubbed up! Knight to E-5. [to Doctor Princess] Where's Baby Snaps? [walking over to Cookie] Excuse, me! Your highness! [gasps] Jake! Oh, hey. Check it out! [gropes around in his mail bag] Special delivery from the Grass Kingdom! He's a princess? I had no idea. Royalty! [sighs contentedly and smiles] We are delighted to host this year's Princess Day in Breakfast Kingdom! Please enjoy the continental breakfast expertly prepared by our Breakfast Chefs. Now, on to more pressing matters. Brigands have been attacking our western seaports, dozens of unregistered princesses roam the land, and trade deficits are at an all-time high. Historically, Breakfast Kingdom has traded one sack of sugar a month to Slime Kingdom in exchange for four eggs, but egg production has plummeted! I can't just pop out eggs on command! I'm an artisan! You have an egg in you right now. [gasps, covers the egg] How dare you? Yeah, and what about that peanut juice, Peanut Princess? My body needs juice! I'm not giving out a single drop of nut butter. Not until Raggedy Princess pays me! Fine! Take it! [starts pulling socks out of her eye] Take all my socks! You still owe me a pair of jorts! [bored, arguing is heard through the room] Aaah! [hits her arms on the table] You guys, I'm bored out of my face! I make a motion to stop talking about dumb stuff that's lame! Oh, Lumpy Space Princess, I'm afraid you'll have to be patient with us and our petty disputes. Not all of us have achieved the self-sufficiency that I assume you have in your kingdom. [gasps] Oh wait, that's right. You don't have a kingdom! You live in a box in the woods. It's not a box. It's a rotting log. [scoffs] Sorry, LSP, but the chair only recognizes real princesses, not bums. What?! I'm like a cool hippie! Whatever, freeloader. If you were invited to Princess Day, it must have been a mistake or as a joke. Am I right, girls? [sitting behind Breakfast Princess] Ohh! The joke's on you because I wasn't invited. I'm crashing! And I already ate a bunch of your food! What you gonna do about it, Princess Egg Breath? Ooh! [leans by Flame Princess] That's true. She does have egg breath. Okay, you've wasted enough of our time. Guards, take this pamplemousse out of my sight. [gasps] You didn't! [guards come out of a door and go towards her] Don't touch me! [walks to the food table and eats a bowl of croissants and leaves] Hmm. Okay. Now that the wannabe's gone, let's get back to princess business. O-Oh, n-not you, Princess Business. Uh, princess business. No, sounds the same. I'm sorry. [floats by Princess Bubblegum] Hey, you want to ditch this jazz? I'd love to, but I'm really invested in this crossword puzzle. Figs. Hmm. [goes out the door where LSP is] LSP, wait up! [looks at the pancake walls] Whoa. [cutting the pancake walls with a knife, muttering] Lousy Breakfast Princess. Pamplemousse. What is that even? Yo, LSP. [LSP turns to Oh. Thanks? You know, I like your vibe, dude. You don't take anyone's sass. Yeah, especially not from that gross pile of greasy hash! She lumpin' humiliated me! Listen, let's get even. Teach Old Greasy Locks a lesson. [holds up a bunch of forks and knives] You're bad. [shows LSP's whole face] And I like it! [scene changes to another room] This place is huge! [starts cutting the pancake walls] [starts singing the Breakfast Song] This place smells like butter, bacon, sausage, and juice. Gonna mess with Breakfast Princess, 'cause she called me pamplemousse. [texting Princess Bubblegum] "Yobo, Peebocheeks. Just kicking down the town with LSP-boos. She is acting sooo bad." [shows "Too late. LSP is really doing it up right now. And I'm just feeding the flames." "Nooooo" exclamation point, exclamation point, exclamation point! [changes back to LSP and Marceline] Look. There. Breakfast Princess' room. How do you want to get past the Maple Man? I'll show you, hon. [goes down the stairs] Ooh! Aah! Hey there! [shakes the plant] Yeah, look over here! What? [his syrup comes out the side of his face, groans and falls, Marceline appears] Nice distraction. Right on. [give each other a high five] [spits the syrup in the plant] Ugh. I can't digest syrup. [hits the Syrup Guard] That's for poisoning my girl. Stop! Okay, just one more time. [hits the guard again] I thought you were bad. Bad people don't stop. Let's don't stop inside. [They go inside Breakfast Princess' room] P-p-p-payback! [goes into her closet, comes back carrying pancakes and bacon] Ugh. All her clothes are sticky. [eats a piece of a pancake] [holding a CD] And her taste in music is terrible. [knocks the CDs off the desk and takes the one she's holding] Check it out. I hate this album, but I'm taking it anyway. [laughs] That's messed up! [eats the pile of pancakes and bacon she's holding in one bite] This'll teach Breakfast Princess. [gives Marceline a high five] [shows him coming from a room, sees the guard] Huh? Jerry! [lifts his head up] Who did this to you, Jerry? I don't know, but they got past me. [Syrup Guard #2 starts opening the door, I can't. Well, [turns invisible] hide then. Uh..Hide where? [goes by the back of the door] I know somebody's in here. I-I heard someone say "where." [LSP goes and picks a grapefruit off a tree, cuts it in half, goes by the door] Getting close now! [opens the door all the way] No sign of the intrud..er. [LSP squeezes the grapefruit so juice gets in the guard's eyes] Aah! My eyes! [LSP laughs, Marceline reappears] Oh, smells like grapefruit. Yeah! [give each other a high five, LSP hits Jerry the Syrup Guard, both laugh and go upstairs] When I recover my sight, I'm going to imprison you, you giggling girls! [tries keeping his eyes open] Aah! [running down a hall, breathing heavily] I got this. [cuts a circle in the pancake wall, they go through it, cuts another circle in another pancake wall, they look outside the hole, the Syrup Guard comes back] [breathing heavily] I don't see them. Hey. [the guard turns around, Marceline makes a scary face at him so he falls out of the hole] Oh, glob. [the guard moans] He's okay! [the guard and another guard come to the guard that fell] Other Jerry, what happened? Yeah! [give each other a high five] [scene changes to her] Okay, let's take a lunch break, everybody. [a guard comes in] Oh, when I mean lunch, I, of course, mean breakfast. Your highness. There are vandals ruining the castle. They are bad. Okay, I'll handle it. [turns to everyone in the hall] Fellow princesses, I got to deal with matters of state. My little sister, Strudel Princess, will take over for me. Eat the berries, dip them in the syrup, whoop whoop, want me to show you how? [scene changes back to her and Marceline, who are in the breakfast car, Whoo! A squirrel taught me how to do that. That's awesome. Stop right there! [gets hit by the car] Hey! Calm your lumps. [kneels by Breakfast Princess, listens to her heart, Breakfast Princess moans] It's okay! She's just dazed. I'll handle it. [puts Breakfast Princess in the trunk] Come on. [puts the CD in the music player, the engine turns over, they drive away from the castle, LSP sighs] It'll be okay, dude. Girls like us just got to stick together. LSP, is that you? Oh, glob, no. Not even. [Marceline takes her out of the trunk, LSP throws a shovel in front of her] What's this for? For digging. Now start building a sand castle. [Breakfast Princess starts digging in the sand, Marceline and LSP get back in the car] Don't stop digging or we'll know! [they drive away, Breakfast Princess stops digging and walks away] [take off their masks] Whoo! [give each other a high five] Yeah. [chuckles] That was totally fun being bad with you, Marcy. [chuckles] Yeah, that was pretty rad. Do you think, like, doing all that bad stuff makes us...like, bad people? Uh...probably not. I don't think there are bad people. I think good people do bad stuff sometimes, and, oh, that's bad. But only if you do it once, it's just a mistake, and...that's not bad. I think. [laughs] Word. But...I mean, [sighs] I do think it was wrong to steal this CD. Yeah, I feel kind of bad about that. We should probably mail it back to her. Yeah. Good call. I—Oh my glob! [they drive into a big ditch, they float out of the car, [give each other a high five] Pow! [scene changes back to her] -Couldn't get up from the bed. I was lazy, and that's why I can't have frosting anymore. Okay, so does everybody have what they want? [all cheer] Wait, I think I'm ready to pop it. [pops the egg out of her, the egg hits Strudel Princess in the face] Happy Princess Day! [giggles] My arm! My face! This happens sometimes... Wait... what?! Oh, my gosh! How many times do I have to tell you? Somebody broke into my house and stole my lumps! Peebo? [With tongue hanging out of mouth while trying to talk] Hey, someone stole half of my face. Eeeeeugh... Eh...okay, calm down... How am I supposed to calm down?! A lumping thief is out there getting fresh with my lumps! Haha, gross. Whoa! Gals... we'll find this crazy freak and return all of your body parts! Thank you so much, Finn! [She tries to walk over to Finn on her two front legs] I should give you a kiss! It's... it's okay, Hot Dog Princess! We'll be right back. I said, "I don't know!" I have nothing to do with this! Stop lying! We found your fingerprints at the crime scene! [Believing him] What? Really? Uuh... no. Oh, well...then...why would you say that? Ice King, we know you did it! Finn, I'm as concerned as you are. There's some sicko out there... What if he comes after my princess? Your princess? Yeah... let me introduce you to my new wife. [ What happened to them, husband? Hmmm... mmm aah! They're sleepy. They are our limp sleepy children! Come on wife, let's have a nice family meal. Okay. Wife, you sit here. Isn't this nice? Uh oh... I mean, that's good! [He copies her.] Oops! How fun! You're so fun! Hahahahaha! Aww... marriage is fun! See, when you wash and I dry, we get done faster! Then tomorrow night we switch! Here, let me show you a trick, my darling. See, you let it soak and we'll wash it in the morning. Enough chores... come along, dear. I want to show you something special... Here it is. I hope you like it... Is there something wrong with me? The way I am...it's not normal... is it? Oh... pretty baby wife. You're the most normal thing in my whole life. We're like two normal jelly beans sitting at the bottom of the jar, floating in a sea of olives, waiting for somebody to guess how many jelly beans are in the jar... which I mentioned. I don't think I understand... Just look into my eyes and know that everything is okay. Are you feeling normal yet? [Princess Monster Wife shrugs, and then giggles.] Okay. [ Oh... Lady don't take my pizza.... What's h— Oww... [Looks at Princess Monster Wife] A mo-mo-mons-mo..... Finn? What's— Are you saying Mama? Where'd you— [Looks at Princess Monster Wife] Hi there! [Stutters] Monster! Oh... don't mind the kids! It's just a phase! I need a glass of water. Ooh, I'll go get— No, it's okay. I'll get it. You are not normal! You are a [Strikes water] monster! [Entering kitchen] Hey, hey, hey.... Monster! A monster! What's going on in here? Nobody's a monster! All I see in this room is a young, kind-hearted, intelligent, hot-looking ice king, and his beautiful princess bride! That's you, sweetie... I don't feel beautiful. I feel like a freak! I will prove to you that you are beautiful! To me, my penguins! Gunter, Gunther, Gunder, Goonder, come on! Gunter, Goonthy, Gonter, Ginthy, follow! Don't rearrange the chairs please. You're all gonna clap and cheer or I'm gonna smack your buns. [Princess Monster Wide walks out onto the runway wearing the outfit If we look at her with these mirrors, her ugliness will have no effect on us. Where is she? Oh! I think she's right over... Hey! Baby, do you want to talk about it? You should just find another princess to marry. I'm unlovable! Girl, I love you as much as all of the other princesses in the world combined! You don't really mean that... I'll prove it! See, you have Elbow Princess's hips, and Dr. Princess's heart and intestines, Slime Princess's bottom... You have all my favorite parts of my favorite princesses! [Crying] I'm just a bunch of stolen parts?! Oh, the parts don't matter. It's you that matters. But... who am I? You're my wife! And I will always love my wife no matter what! You'd love me, even without these other princess's parts? Sure, baby, even without all your fine lady parts. Now give us a hug. Hey, Ice King! Your wife's face can't make us faint anymore! Don't listen to them babe; they're being negative! Run, my happiness! I'll distract them with ice magic! Ouch. Do you give up?! Yes! I give up... Finally... let's get those princess parts back to the ladies. Yeah, mans. Wait... where'd your wife go? Huh? Let me go! Let me go! Though my parts be scattered, I will always be your wife. She... she... gave away all my stuff! Ow ow, ow! [Seethes then blushed.] Your shoe rash is gross, man. [Zooms on Finn's shoe rash.] Oh, I'm gonna throw up! [Gags] Ah, I'm just kidding! Man, I wish I had my other sock, this callous is gonna junk up my good time at PB's potluck. Don't worry man, we're going to have a ton of fun. We'll eat some melon, I'll get some compliments on my pretty makeup. You look like a target. I look pretty! [Coming from far away] Does everyone have a tray? [He sees a bounce house] [Shrieks] Bounce House! Come on, Jake! [Goes infront of Bounce House Princess.] Bounce bounce! [Prepares to climb in.] Oh ho. Oh, hi Finn. Oh my goodness, sorry Bounce House Princess, I didn't know it was you. Ah ha, that's okay, you wanna go inside, bounce around a little? [Opens her cover.] [Embarrassed and blushing] Mmm that's okay. Come on, Jake. Let's, eh, go party. Hey guys. [Heading towards a table.] Hello. Hello, Princess Princess Princess, hey, Embryo Princess, heeey youuu. Welcome to the potluck guys. Jake, you look pretty. Thank you. What's up with the limp? I've been going foot nude in the shoe and now I got this turbo huge callous. [Stretches up leg to show Princess Bubblegum.] [Gags] Well, sit down and relax. Oh, by the way, I've entered everyone's name into a raffle and the winner gets whatever is in that. [Points to a large blue cooler on the side of the table.] Mysterious. Oh, brought something for the party! Oh, how wonderful! Bam! Soda! Oh... It's warm and I shook it up... a lot. Well, great, I'll just put this on ice. [Walks up to a pile of snow and places Soda Can into it.] [Sings "Hair Teepees"] [His senses go off in the form of blue waves.] [Gasps] Someone outside is messing with my ice! [Picks up Gunter and flies to window to look at his telescope.] Let's see what's going on down there Gunts. [Gasps] My on-again-off-again GF Princess Bubblegum — [Gasps] — my BFs Finn and Jake, all the fine princesses that want to date me! What the heck?! My bro-dogs for life are throwing a party without me?! [Puts down Gunter.] Just when you think you got some great bros they kick you to the curb! [Walks back to window.] Oh, I see how it is, they're gonna do me like that? So I'mma do them like this! [Shakes fist.] Caw! Caw! [Laughs and nets the rabbit.] That's how the owls do it. [Picks rabbit out of net.] Well, hello, little one. You're going to help me ruin a party! [Puts rabbit in a sack and laughs.] Meow. [It paws at a bug.] Eeh? [He nets the cat.] [Places a lemon on the cat, the lemon promptly falls off.] Meow? Oh, quiet you. [Places another lemon on the cat and this time it appears to stay balance, he then grabs a piece of yarn and secures the lemon.] That's it for the kitties! [Shoves cat into sack.] [Walks over to kitchen table.] How are my bunnies doing? Hee hee, that's it, ah yes. Gunter! More lazagnah! Whenk. [Pulls out fresh baked lasagna.] Okay! [Opens sack that contains the cats.] Go, my little sour pussies, ruin their party! Hee hee hee. [Stops dancing to see a cat with a lemon on its back.] Meow... Awww, hey Jake, check out this cat. I don't like cats, man! [Continues dancing.] Do you like fresh lemon in your ice tea? Yes. [Squeezes lemon drops into Jake's drink.] Ha ha! Alright! [Squeezing lemon in her drink.] It looks like we don't have to make that lemon run after all. Yes! [He "tsks" and grumbles. He reaches for the second sack containing the rabbits.] At least I still have my "party-poopers," heh heh, raagh! Oh glob [Pants] Urrreeh! [Closes sack and wipes hand on his robe.] So much lazagnah. [Walks away leaving the sack in the snow.] Gunter, daddy needs you to dress up like a princess so you can sneak into that party and throw fruit punch on everybody. Wenk. Huh, you wanna do that for daddy, huh? Wenk! [Flaps flippers.] Thanks, sweetie! I can always count on my Gunts! [Begins to rip off tape and stick socks on Gunter's body.] [Picks up bottle cap.] Finishing touch. [Puts cap on Gunter's head.] Yeah, Gunter, hot! You better be careful Gunter or I'll keep you like this all the time! Heh, I just might have to chase you around... Marry you— [Pulls out a taser] Oh, whoa! Just kidding! [Turns off taser and places in sock skirt.] [Carries Gunter to window.] Arms out Gunter. [Tossing Gunter out of the window he uses his ice breath to send her gliding downward.] Wenk. [Walks to table.] [Viewing through a telescope.] Yes, atta Gunter, get a cup of punch! Wenk! [Grabs a cup of punch.] [Walks over to Jake who is dancing.] [Jake spots Huh?! Oh, hey, Gunter. Hey, everybody, Gunter is here! [Everyone says "hey, Gunter" and waves.] [An arrow comes off screen and nearly hits Gunter, come party with us. No, Gunter! Do not party with them! Get those buns on the dance floor, girl! [Everyone begins to chant "Gunter."] Wenk. [Drinks a little soda and goes in the middle of a ring.] [He starts dancing.] No, Gunter! [Starts crying.] Hmm, hey, Gunter, let me get one of them socks. [Pulls out taser and electrocutes Finn's arm which causes him to back away while screaming.] Oh... ow. They think their party is the bee's knees huh. That party is the knees of nothing! Bargh! There oughta be a law! Wait a minute... there is a law, hee hee, do I have what it takes?  I'm calling to tattle. Oh, okay, who are you tattling on? The loud party going on next door, it's bothering everyone in the Ice Kingdom? Is this the Ice King? Yes. Well uh, we hate you, so — [Hangs up phone, laughed and the other  [High pitched voice.] Yes, this is a little old lady calling about the loud party. Is this the Ice King? [Has on pink shawl and holding a cane.] Noooo, this is Mrs. Garam-bling-ton... Mrs. Garamblington? Yeah, hold on let me get my husband. [Tosses away shawl and cane and puts on hard hat.] [In a deep voice] Yeah, this is Ted Garamblington, I need you to shut down this party. Your wife sounds pretty old. Uh, hold on there's someone at the door. [Knocks on wall.] Yes, hello? [Takes off hard hat and puts on a cap.] [High boyish voice] Hey, Mr. Garamblington, it's me, the pizza delivery boy. [Puts on hard hat.] Oh, hi, Johnny. [Puts on cap.] Boy, that sure is a loud party out there, hope it's not bothering the Mrs. [Puts on hard hat with cap still on.] It's okay Johnny, I'm on the phone with the Banana Guard and they're going to take care of it. [Boyish voice] Oh, that's good. [Deep voice] Well, what do I owe ya, Johnny? [Boyish voice] It's twelve fifty-seven, Mr. G. [Deep voice] Okay, there you go, the prices are going up. [Boyish voice] Oh, geez, do you have anything smaller? [Deep voice] Ah, let me check with my brother, George. Hey, George! [Another voice] What?! [Deep voice] The pizza is here, you got any cash on ya? [Another voice] I only got a fifty dollar bill! Uh, Mr. Garamblington? [Deep voice, wearing another hat.] Yes? We'll take care of it. Ha haa! [Goes to window, pulls out opera glasses.] Now to watch Banana law in action. This is a great party. Two can play the party game! [Puts radio on a stool and turns it on.] Ooh, nice. Alright come on Gunthalina, I need you to pass out some whirling dervishes, the guests are getting restless. [Holding plate with grapes.] Loose grape medley, stack of enriched flour tortillas — and start with Roger, he looks famished. Wenk! [Takes food over to Roger and shoves them into its bottom.] Everyone, smile and eat... and make our neighbors jealous. [Pulls out telescope to see Gunter still dancing around and the partygoers still cheering.] Bah! Gunter's too captivating! [Up beat music plays.] Um? Oh yeah! [Runs over to radio.] Oh this is my jam! Time to get my freak nasty on! [Turns up volume.] Roger, dance with me! [He jumps on Roger and begins to dance around him.] [He looks through his telescope again to see everyone still cheering for Gunter.] Come on! If only there was some way I could magically ruin their party. [Looks at hands.] Wait a minute [Laughs] forgetful me! I thought you were my bros, my roll dogs for life! [Sends down hail which hits everyone and causes them discomfort. "Ow, Ow! Hey, everyone, take refuge in my body! [Everyone climbs inside her, except Finn who is sitting on the food table.] Ice King, don't make me stand up and whomp you! Well, if that's what it takes for a fella to get noticed around here, then whomp me! [Sends down another ice lightning shard, this time directed at Finn who dodges it.] That's.... IT! [Takes off sock less shoe. He back flips on top of Bounce House Princess and grabs onto the Ice King. He then puts his shoe on his nose.] Oh mama, that's some stink! [Loses altitude.] Aaaah! Why are you doing this, IK?! Because she didn't invite me to her potluck! Yes, I did! I sent your invite in the mail! The mail?! Who reads the mail! I just stack all my mail in a tall pile until it falls over, heh heh, then I shred it to use as cascarones! [Takes one out and smashes it on Finn's face.] So uh, can I party with you? Only if you promise to stop acting nanners. Nanners, well I don't even know the meaning of the word. Whoo ooh! Party time, right guys?! Whooo hooo! [Finn is making a shoe for his feet and Jake is just eating some sort of tortilla.] It's time for the raffle. And the winner is.... Finn. Whoa, cool. [Takes out prize] Congrats, Finn, you won a... Sea Lard. [Hands it to Finn.] Here you go. Awesome. [Laughs] You won a sea lard, that donks — [An arrow lands on YOU SON OF A BLEE-BLOB!!!! [Foaming at the mouth] Jaaaaake!!! Heeey, yooou... Oh, no, our sled's broken! Hey, let's build one out of snow! [Starts to gather snow] What are you doing, Jake? Sleds are for suckers. Just ride on my gut. Okay! [Jumps onto his gut and they slide down a hill] Switch! [Frozen] Switch back! Switch back! [Jake grows and they switch again as they slide through a horde of penguins] Penguins! Ha Ha! I'm a flying dog! [They fist tap in midair] What?! [Approaches the crater] Who dares enter the Aww, Ice King's here. You know why I'm here? Do you know what " Yeah, I know what "Ice King" means A big nerd! Oh ho oh! Holy cow! It means I'm King of Ice! This is my domain! And you are violating Ice World law--trespassing! Come on, brother! We're just trying to beat the heat. Yeah! There's a big sleeping lava man in our front yard, and he is SOOOOOOOOOOOO hot! Mmm-hmm! Wait, wait, no, I take it back. I mean, not like "sexy" hot. No, no, you do mean "sexy" hot. No, I mean-- [Annoyed] I don't care! This is my kingdom. You guys can't just scoot about on my land willy-nilly. I've got rules here. [Sighs] Why don't you just try being cool. [Flips out] What?! I am the king! I am the king of c-cool c-co ca... That's it! Rise, monsters of snow, and go beat up Finn and Jake! [Uses magic to bring out snow monsters] Uh oh. [Laughs] [Angry] Ooh, you guys are gonna get it. Heh heh, yeah. Yeah, right, sure. [Groans] I need a magic back. [Cracks his back and pulls out a plastic sandwich bag] Trail mix. [Begins to pick around in it] Ick...ooh, yogurt chip. [Eats yogurt chip and puts the bag away] Tuck, tuck. [Begins to push the wheelbarrow again] Aww man. I'm back home! Hello, ladies! Now, now. I've brought you a baby and a puppy. [Tosses Finn and Jake into the room, where they smash against the wall and are freed from the ice] Finn! Are you okay? Huh, Wildberry Princess? Hot Dog Princess? W-what's goin' on? We're all prisoners, Finn. Ice King! What? Why are you keeping these girls prisoners, jerk? You don't understand! I collect princesses because I want to marry one. Well, why'd you capture six of them if you just want to marry one? I'm collecting them all first to be sure I make the right choice. You're both too young to understand, but marriage is a serious thing and lasts forever. You can't just rush into it, you know? Ice King, don't do this. Just let the girls go. They don't want to be here. Of course they do! I would have killed them already if they didn't want to be here. Right ladies? [Shoots ice lighting from his fingers] Zzhp Zzhp. Mm-hm. [Sighs] Don't worry, princesses. I pledge that Jake and I will protect each and everyone of you and furthermore I see all of you happily married to whatever sweet thing y'all want to be married to! Yay! [Grumbles] Rad! All I need is something to spear the Ice King with. [Begins to search through his backpack] Binoculars... toothbrush...water bottle...rope... [Worried tone] sweater... trail mix... my flute! [Pulls out a broken, bandaged flute and plays it] My flute! Aw, nuts, dude! You broke it when we tried picking the lock to that sad ogre's heart! Darn it! Nice try, boy! Princesses, did you see? Did you see Finn fail? Don't worry, Finn. I'll get us out of here with Key Hand! Hah-hah! [Uses Key Hand] Oh, no you won't! [Freezes Jake from the neck down] Jake! Eat it. [Frozen] I... I'm okay. Ice King! You better either set us free or come in here and fight me 'cause otherwise I'm gonna flip out!!! Oh, are you trying to hit me? Well, excuse me because I have to go potty in the bathroom. [Goes to the bathroom] ICE KING!!!... Finn! Huh? Jake, you alright? I'm fine, buddy. Calm down and tend to the princesses. Oh my gosh. I'm sorry, princesses. Slime Princess, are you alright? He's held us here for weeks, questioning us about our favorite sports and quirky behavior. I've tried to tell him as little as possible. I understand. And, Lumpy Space Princess, how do you fair? I'm bored, and I'm not having any fun. [Returning] What? Not having any fun? But last night I read you the story of "Baby Whatsit and the Bottle Prince." That wasn't fun. That was lame. Other princesses, do you feel the same way? Well, here, watch. I'll show you. We'll have some fun. Fun's my middle name. Here, now, Wildberry Princess. I need you to play this. [Puts the piano by the cell] I don't know how. Well, come here, I'll teach you. Put your hand through the bars, atta princess, and uh... [Guides Wildberry Princess' hand to play the tune] I don't think I can. Just play it like I showed you. Leave her alone, Ice King! PLAY IT OR I'LL SQUISH YOU INTO JUICE!!! Oh dear! [Plays the tune] Yeah, keep playing it. Now everyone pick up an instrument and play it. Oh, this is going to be so much fun! What are you thinking, Finn? I've almost devised a plan. I'm gonna let him drum till' I've finalized the details in my mind. Sweet Oh, that was fun! Ah! It was fun! Hey, you should get some more fun stuff. You're right! Good idea, Finn. "Good idea," indeed. I hope they think I'm fun. [He leaves] Alright. I've got a plan on how to get out of here. First everyone needs to be dancing and laughing and saying fun stuff like "Whoopee"! Okay, when the Ice King comes back, everyone play it up, like we want him to come inside the jail and party with us and when he steps inside, I'm gonna beat the tar out of him with these... [Shows his fists] ...while you all take care of Jake. Everyone on board with this? Sweet plan, dude! I think by everyone saying "whoopee" the plan won't work cause he'll know we're faking it. Good point, Lumpy Space Princess. I'm gonna say something fun like "Oh yeah, I'm having a fun time! Oh my gosh, havin' the best time I've ever had in my entire life!" Make way for the fun tray! Whoa, what's happening? What is this? We're having fun! Whoopee! Because I left the room? Because they like it here. Because they like you. Because you're a really fun guy! I don't get this. [whispering] He's not buying it. Dance harder. Come on in here and party. Wanna dance with us, Ice King? Come on! Me? You want to dance with me? Oh yeah! Whoo! Woohoo! [Drops the board game] Wow! [Opens cell door and walks in] Yes! Yes! Whoopee! Wait, no! [Shoots ice lighting at Emerald Princess, but she avoids it] Don't leave! I'll kill you all! [Finn punches him and No! That is not the case! You're nuts, man! And I don't know how to help you! Probably because I'm just a simple dude. So maybe you should talk to someone with more life experience, like Jake! Whoa, whoa, whoa, Finn, what are you doing? Don't dump the Ice King on me! But you gotta get it in you're head, man! Putting princesses in jail is wrong! Bah! Finn, you just ruined my chances with 5 or 6 potential wives! For that you will... [Finn punches him in the beard] Ohh! Oh, my beard. [Finn roundhouse kicks him into a wall where his crown falls off and he loses consciousness] Why do people not like me? Is it because I'm a magic user or is my beard too shaggy? [Sighs] I try so hard to be a good husband for girls. What's wrong with me? Hoo. You're a sociopath. Who are you? [Laughs] I know. You're probably a--a big nerd! Why don't you try being cool like me? [Flies away laughing when he regains consciousness and is being tickled by penguins] Star dust is so ticklish! [Laughs until he opens his eyes] What happened? Princesses? Ohhh... Thank you, Finn. [Picks her up] You're welcome, Slime Princess! And remember when you vowed to marry us to the thing of our choosing? Yeah... Well, I'd like to marry you. Ooooh! [Awkwardly] Oh, heh heh, well how 'bout that...[whispers] Jake, help me! Oh, eh... Slime Princess, you shouldn't marry Finn. He pees his pants constantly. All the time. Ewww! Oh, gross! Put me down! Put me down!!! Heh heh, I'm sorry. Jake! [Angrily grunts] [shaped like a tractor, backing up] Beep beep! Look out! Beep beep! Pillow delivery! Look out buddy! [He drops the pillows on Finn.] Uuf! [BMO falls on his head and CMO falls on BMO's head.] Uuf! Come on, Jake... Sorry buddy, [changes into his normal form] just trying to cheer you up some. I mean here you are chillin' out with history's coolest friends, building an actual pillow fort, but you just sit there sulking--I mean, what gives!? [sigh] I guess I'm just thinking about Flame Princess. I told her a joke the other day and she didn't even laugh or anything. I guess it's over between us. That's it?! A joke? Maybe she just didn't get it yet. Yeah right, BMO. More like she used up all her laughs on some other guy's jokes probably. Man, having a girlfriend is hard. No! Being crazy is hard. You're getting all hung up, all hung up on imaginary problems. You gotta focus on what's real, man. [Grabs a cup.] You see this cup? This is literally my favorite cup. [He throws it through the window, shattering the window.] Now it's gone forever. So it's not real, and I don't care about it anymore. [gasp] Oh no! My favorite window! I don't even know what you guys are talking about. I think I just need some alone time. [Grabs his cup and sword.] Gotta let my mind fester a bit, you know? I'll be back in a little while. [ [ Man, this looked smaller from the outside. What's this now? What the?! Jake, what's in here?! Jake? Oh, whoa! [birds chirping] Did Jake build this part too? That guy needs some more girlfriends or something. [Turns towards the door, which has inexplicably disappeared.] Hey Jake! You need more girlf--what the...? Door's gone? Hmm, maybe there's another door in yonder pillow town. [Slides towards pillow town] I don't get this at all. Dragon!! Blanket Dragon! Run! Huh? [bumps into Finn's leg] Oof! Hey mistah, you betta get wunnin'! Bwanket Dwagon! Now this, I understand! [Battle yell] [ Wow. [cheering] Did you see that? Hey, uh, how's it going? Puhoy there! I am Hah, it's nothing; I kill things all the time. Oh, nonsense! This calls for a celepillowbration! [cheering] [sighs then sits down.] There you are, Finn the Human. Oh, hey there... Um, you can just call me All right, Finn. My name is Oh, uh... Just kidding! Heh. Oh, uh, your dad seems fun. Oh, ha ha, oh my! Puhzah! [chuckles] Yeah. Um, you wanna dance? Oh, well... [a pillow bird flies and lands beside him.] I...have a girlfriend. [pillow bird chirps] [laughs] [playfully hits Finn on the cheeks] Dummy, it's a dance, not marriage. [laughs nervously] Yeah, okay! [The pillow bird poops a little pillowcase on [Walking on the dance floor.] Are you telling me that birds in your world don't poo little pillowcases? Naah, just regular poo. Hey, like this. [She grabs his hand and places it on her hip, which absorbs it.] Eh, yeah, i-it's really cool. Where I come from, I live with my best friend, who's my brother. And he's a dog.[chuckles] We fight stuff; it's cool. It's really different than here. I mean, where I'm from, blankets and pillows are used for bedding. [laughs] Well they're used for that here too. [Blushes then laughs nervously.] Heh heh uh. Woo oo ooh hoo hoo! Pill-ightful! Ah man, it's been nice, Roselinen. But I gotta get back to my home. [turns to Quilton.] Quilton, I need your help to find a portal to my home world. Of course, we will do our best to help you, Finn the Flesh Pillow. But you're not making a fold of sense! Please, share our food. You need nourishment. [eating a pillow] [muffled] It tastes... like... a pillow... I'll give your compliments to the pillow. Oh, there you are! You found your mug. I thought you said you didn't care. [sips the cup] That mug is empty. I wonder what Finn's up to... [dressed up like the blanket dragon.] Roar! I'm the Blanket Dragon!! [wearing Finn's hat and holding a pillow sword.] Well, I'm daddy! Sha-pow! Jay, Bonnie. I bet your dad's just about finished chopping wool. You guys wanna bring him his lunch? Yes! [chopping pillow trees with his sword and looking quite older.] [laughs] Alphanumeric! [hugs the pillow sheep] Pillow sheep! You have more fluff than sense! [kisses the pillow sheep then kicks it.] Daddy! Oh! [laughs.] What is this! [carried Bonnie.] A pack of fearsome pillow goblins?! [laughing.] Ha ha, daddy, we're your kids! Psst, Finn, they've brought you lunch. Oh, they have, have they? [grabs one tiny pillow.] Tiny pillows. Mmm mmm mm mmm. [giggles] [to Roselinen] Darling, you've outdone yourself. [driving up in his car] Honk, honk! Grandpillow! What's my father doing here? Puhoy! Grandpillow! Oh oh oh, come here! Oh, but I've come to speak with your father. What is it, Quilton? When you first arrived here, you told us of a mysterious door that led you to our world. Yes, of course. Archaeologists found this in the Pillow Catacombs [Shows the book to Finn, opening up to the door page.] The Pillownomicon. Oh my glob. There is no information about the door, save for the fact it shows up periodically, and then disappears. Quilton, I need to find that door. [Roselinen makes a very sad face] Uhhh, hey BMO, I gotta snag my mug from you. [Removes the wig then puts it on top of BMO's wig.] Oh, really? Hey don't sweat it, I'll make us some hot chocolate. Jake, you drive a hard burger. [looking older than his last appearance, goes in a tent where Rasheeta is.] Hello? Ah yes, come in. Are these The Great Abracadabra Mountains? And are you Rasheeta the Great Oracle, dweller of said mountains? Yes, you must be Finn the Human Man, seeker of the wandering portal. Yes, I've searched for decades--how did you know? I've read it in the Tea Leaves, [grabs a newspaper] this newspaper I found from the future. Does it say how I get home? The real question is are you sure you want to? Uh... yeah! Well don't worry, you won't be here long. [farts.] So there is another way to... [covers his nose.] Oof... Not long now. [farts again.] Oh... [coughing from the stench of Rasheeta's farting, he leaves the tent.] Father? What did the oracle say, father? Have we come to the right spot finally? I think so, but the oracle spoke in riddles. [stroking his beard] Gonna have to fester on this one for a bit... Oh, Finn. I know you have to go, all these years I've known, but now that it's time... [sniffles then starts crying.] Oh man, I'm just all messed up about it. Just promise me you'll remember us, [wipes her tears.] when you're back in your real life. Hmm, that reminds me, Roselinen, of something Jake told me just before I came to this world. [distorted voice while strangely looking different] You're getting all hung up on imaginary problems, stay with your new wife. You've known her longer now than any of us. You're not even sure if I ever really existed. And I'm pretty sure I didn't look like this. [to himself] Man. How did he see it all coming so clearly? [to family] Come on, everyone. Pack your things, we're going home. [laughing] Ha ha he, ha ha he, goodness, Jake, why don't you do this with your other babies? Well, Rainicorn babies age rapidly. They don't need their parents a couple hours after they're born. That really stinks, huh? Mmmmm. Hot chocolate is ready! Finn... Finn. [weakly saying.] Wha—where? Are you comfortable? I'm... alright. Um, dad... [voice breaks] dad. We.. just.. wanted to say... that we-- [starts crying.] [Puts hand on Bonnie] [sadly] That... we love you dad. [strokes his beard] I remember... back... when I was dad. [sighs and rolls his eyes] Dad, you are dad... [snaps and puts his hands up] I ain't dad yet! Oh, no, wait! Here it comes! Woo hoo hoo hoo hooooo, BOY! [Camera angle from HUP! Hey buddy, you feeling better already? Huh? Oh. Uhh, I don't know, man. I just had the number one wildest dream. Really? Yeah! I was-- [His phone starts to ring, then he answers it.] Hello? Oh hey! Oh. [chuckles] Yeah, thanks! Yeah, okay, bye. [hangs up] That was Flame Princess. She said she didn't get my joke until just now and that it's really funny and awesome! [laughs]. Ha ha! I knew it! Yeah, that's great man. Now what about this dream? What dream? The dream you were just talking about. Huh? Just a second ago! [shrugs] The dream you just had in the pillow fort! [shrugs again and blows a raspberry] Pfft! [Laughs] Ahhh... YEAH!!! [Busts through living room door and lands on bridge.] [Entering] Heh heh. [Deep voice] Aw, yeah. [Chuckles] Jake, get ready for a slap in the jowls. [Slaps Jake's nose; Jake does a snorting laugh] Seriously, though... get ready... for a day filled with adventure! Whoa, really?! Yeah, man!! [He slaps Jake's nose again, making him snort and laugh again] I wrote on my arm this to-do list of cool junk. [The clouds begin to get darker and bigger] Number one back flip off this bridge and do the splits. Number two track down and slay a goblin horde. Number three...[Glances up at thundering clouds] storm clouds? [Examining] Hmmm... [Knives fall from the clouds and I've never seen a knife storm before... It's beautiful. Looks like we're stayin' in today, kid. Well, what're we gonna do? Who wants to play video games?? BMO!! What's on the menu, BMO? I've created a new game called Conversation Parade. Hah! Alright! Start it up, BMO! [singing] What do you think about the stars in the sky? 'S okay, I guess. Yeah, they're cool. That is an interesting response! Battery low... Shut doooowwwwn... Booooo. BMO, that was weak. What now? Ooh, ooh! Dude, I know somethin' totally rockin' we can do! Whoa! What?! Let's use our imaginations, man! Barf that! Imagination is for turbo nerds who can't handle how kick-butt reality is! I'm a kick-butt reality master!! I would rather die than be imaginative. I mean that. Eh. Your loss. [Beat] AAAH!!! Lava!! Lava all around us!! [Panicking and jumping around] Lava on the floor! Shut up, man... Seriously, man! There must be an enchantment on the house or somethin'! I'm not playing you child-style games, guy. Watch and learn as I master... reality. [Moves his foot nearer and nearer to the floor] NOOOOO!! [Places foot on floor; it suddenly catches fire] AAAAH!!! [Putting fire out] Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Jake! What the hey-hey?! I was just playin' around with my imagination... [In It's like... whatever you imagine becomes real... That's bananas! [To himself] Don't imagine blowin' apart my own brain... Don't imagine my eyeballs coming alive and flying around with rocket packs... Dude! Imagine that BMO invented a better video game, and that he has new batteries. WHOA! But first stop imagining lava! I can't! My imagination's too amazing! Imagine turning your imagination off! I can't, dude... but I think I can imagine an imagination turning-off machine... that is upstairs, surrounded by a crud-load of traps, ghosts, monsters, and poison fountains, and... and... girls. Cute girls, and hamsters. Can't you make it easier to get to that machine? You can't hold this baby back! That's bad parenting, mamma! Then it's up to me to take your imagination downtown! Let's go to the den and suit up! Neat! [Finn and he enter the den] Grab that missile. Okay. And... get that cosmic gauntlet. Nah. There's a better one over by the desk. Ah! UNH! [ I'm imagining a wall. You can just go around it. Really? That's it? There isn't any invisible, angry troll or anything? Oh, there's one now. [Troll roars] Look out! Aah! I can feel it on my foot! [They stumble over, and You're kickin' too high! He's shorter than you! Yah, yah! [ Alright! You're gettin' him, man! [Finn continues attacking] Uh-oh. Now you're uppercutting his family. [Finn kicks in the air and a scream is heard.] Heh heh heh heh heh! You just kicked his wife in the face! [Troll wife yells incomprehensibly.] She's comin' back for revenge. Cram this! We gotta book it to your imagination machine! Yah! The knife storm, remember?!?! [Finn frantically pulls himself and [Standing up] Okay. Try to imagine some kind of steel umbrella over the bridge so... we don't get knifed. Okay! [Does it] It is done. [Walks out cautiously] Haha! Ha! Hey, you did it, man! No, voyagers. To pass this bridge, you must first pass the test of the riddle. [To Jake] An imaginary riddle master? [Sighs] Ask me your riddle, Riddle Master. I accept your test. Then brace yourself, fool, for this riddle comes from a mysterious, far-away land. [Ready] LAY IT ON ME!! Yes, um... The riddle, uh... It... cometh... uh... I can't imagine a riddle. Dude, just make it super easy. THE RIDDLE COMETH! Tell me, voyager. What is simple, and yet also... a riddle? Man, that riddle sucks. THAT IS THE WRONG ANSWER!! The penalty is... DEATH BY SNAKES!! YEAH, RIGHT! I'VE GOT A MISSILE!! You exploded the snakes right at us!! I can feel them all over my face! Imaginary poison coursing through my veins!! I'm sorry, brother! I'm so sorry! Let's just get to your imagination machine and we'll be okay!! AAH! A big bowl of baby elephants, chainsaws, and doo-doo's flyin' towards us!! JUMP, DUDE!! [Finn evades the obstacle.] Here come's a soul-eater! Snap its neck! [Finn jumps up and does so. A weapon is heard charging up. Hey! Don't shoot us with that bazooka! Don't you do it... DON'T DO IT, MAN!!! Hee... heehee... hee... Okay. YEAH! AW, YEAH! Alright, use your powers or something. This poison is about to kill me. Alright. Goin' up. Check it. My imagination-off machine is left of the bed. Is it clear? Yeah, I mean there's a bunch of cute girls... but they shouldn't bother you. Oh! I found the shut-off lever! Cool, man! [Invisible girl giggles.] Dang, girl. If you weren't a figment of my imagination, I'd want to have your baby. [Another girl giggles.] What're you laughin' at? Alright. I'm gonna turn it off. [ Dude... I can't see anything... I must've imagined... an invisible monster!! What?! Well, how do I kill it?! [ I'm comin', buddy! Alright, Invisibo. Eat a piece of this! [Punches it] Hurry, Finn! Get to the lever! Okay! I'm doin' iiiit!! [ [Completely regular tone] Hello, Finn. I am awake and healthy. Jake... what happened to your bombastic personality? I do not know what you mean. I am perfectly bombastic. Nah, man, nah. Somethin's wrong. Tell me something amazing! But Finn, I cannot tell you something amazing as there is nothing amazing happening around us that I could describe for you. Ah, see, man, you suck now! Crap, it's your imagination. You need that thing. [Sighs] Jake... Stop it, man. You're just playing one continuous note. One note is all that is needed. [Scoffs] I'm gonna turn your imagination back on. [Fidgets around and mumbles to self] Jake! Your imagination on-off switch has vanished! True. Doth thou not remember shutting down mine imagination? I remembereth. I am happy that my imagination is gone. It was purposeless. No! It was the opposite of that stuff. I know this now... [Saddened] ...only too late. Okay, man. I'm gonna try to imagine an imagination back-on switch for you, and so you know, if there's anything dainty inside my imagination, I'm gonna be mad. Imagination... go... [ [Disappointed] Cram. Oh! Maybe I can try imagining something. [He imagines a penguin, and a bowl of spaghetti. The Lyre Player trips over the former and lands in the latter; [Entering] Good morrow, sir! My name is No! How'd you get in my Imagination Land?! [Giggles] I don't know, my young fellow! You tell me. Perhaps I represent your secret desire to be civilized! REPRESENT THIS! [Smacks Bellamy] And this. [Imagines two arms protruding out of Bellamy (one cephalopodic and one robotic) which both punch him.] Oh! I say! Oh! Ah! Ouch! Ah! Haha... Penguins... Hahahaha! Heh, alright. [Runs over to the machine] I hope this works, Jake! [Pulls lever; Jake's imagination returns.] Haha, yeah! [A fairy comes near the machine giggling.] Hey! Get away from that! Don't push that hyper drive button! [The fairy does.] [ [Frustrated sigh] Take a hike, fairy! Normal style! [Pushes "NORMAL STYLE" button] [Head shrinks] Aw, man... I imagined my mom naked! [Finn appears next to him.] Yugh! You okay? I think so. Lemme check. Mmmm... Yup. She's clothed now. And hey, man! It's clear out now! We can go on an adventure! I don't know, dude. I think we got all the adventure we need right here... [Thinking] with... lava on the floor! Huh?! [Body starts melting] AAH! AAH! MY LEGS ARE MELTING! Just kidding. [Chuckles and reforms his body.] Hahahaha! Good dog. [He pets Jake, and the episode ends.] [yawns] [turns on the light] Good morning, Princess! [screams] Finn! You scared me! I am sorry, Princess! What are you doing here, Finn? Since I got out of my last relationship, I've been slackin' on the job. So I'm rededicating my life to protecting, serving, and meeting your every need. Jake said I was acting bananas about the whole thing and wanted no part of this. It's 530 in the morning. That's right, Princess. I'm gettin' back on the job hardcore, giving 100% of my being all for you. Thank you, that's very nice. [opens fridge] No need to thank me, PB. It's my job. Heh. Thank you. [reaches for an egg] [hands her one] How am I doin' my job, Princess? Am I crushin' it? Yes, but can you move just a bit... No, no, like, out of the way. Oh! [moves aside] Okay, what else do I need? Aw, dangit, I forgot we're out of milk. Now I have to go get it from— [covers her mouth] Buh-buh-buh! I got it! [runs and jumps out the window] Hyah! Milk... You wanted milk... Finn, I thought you went home. Yes, I do regret the slow return, but I assure you, this is the highest quality milk available. It's mink's milk. I milked a mink. 100% dedication, no limits for what I do for you. I'd throw Peppermint Butler off this balcony if you ask. [Peppermint Butler becomes surprised] Sorry, Peppermint Butler, just joking, but kinda sorta not. [takes the milk from Finn] You're really going over the top here. Take it easy. Princess's orders. Okay, I'll just rest here. No, no, resting on the job is not resting. Go somewhere where you can relax! Yes, Princess. [falls off the balcony] [singing while climbing up a mountain of garbage] Princess, I give my life to you girl, you are the best dang princess in the whole wide world. [ Leave this dump now! [coughs] You dropped a car on my lady, bro. Now I gotta restore her honor. I hope you're wearing underwear. [He summons his grass sword. Rattleballs takes out his sword and charges at No. Instead, I will pluck out your eyes with the point of my sword, and whenever you try to see stuff, you will think only of me, Do it! I ain't a baby! [Rattleballs is about to strike with his sword, You have a warrior's spirit! [coughs] Something I haven't seen in a long time. But your swordsmanship is [blows raspberry]. You should learn to master your weapon before you draw it. [ What?! You're just gonna tell me I'm terrible and walk away? Teach me sword stuff, man! [Rattleballs farts and coughs] I know you're back there. I brought you a muffin. I don't eat muffins; I'm a robot. [coughs] Look, I know you don't know me and we got off on the wrong foot, but please, dude, teach me how to use the sword. Please! [Rattleballs coughs] You okay? No. When I was a young robot, I went horseback riding. No one taught me how to post. The horse took a crazy jump, and I came down on the saddle hard. One of my gumballs bounced up inside me. It's been lodged in a weird spot for years. Oh, here. [ More to the left! Getting closer. Closer! [the gumball dislodges] You got it! [ Yeah, perhaps you feel a sense of indebted obligation to me? Yes! I will teach you the sword stuff. Lesson one block my eggs! [ Yut! [ Hahahahaha! Egg-celent! [He throws more eggs] Yeah! That's right! I can take it! [ You have done well today! You have felt the sting of the yolk, endured the sizzle of the mini-BBQ. Perhaps you are ready to learn my secret technique. Secret technique! Watch! [The shed behind Finn and his bandages explode apart] What the—?! [He looks upon a piece of wood left of the shed, in the shape of The shadowless thrust. Your blade must be swift enough to slice the air between you and the target, removing all wind resistance. [He charges at a pile of garbage which explodes apart] Now you try. [Finn summons his sword and starts swaying his sword] Again. [Finn continues until nightfall] So, am I a master swordsman now? [ You will be if you train this hard every day... for ten years... and get a robot body. Oh. So, uh, why you livin' in this dump? You should be out in the world, saving fancy ladies and junk. That, my friend, is a long tale... which I will tell you now. [flashback begins of the Candy Kingdom under construction] It was a much wilder time in the Candy Kingdom. I was a member of an elite robot police force created by Princess Bubblegum. Her previous attempts at law enforcement had been a bunch of goofs. [the flashback shows a rock shop. A rock person breaks out of the window, holding rocks, and keeps running] Stop Him! Go! Go! Go! Go! [ A robot slices the rock person into pieces with his sword and was put into a big pile of broken rock people] Our righteous swords cut a swath through the chaos, but we were too successful. [The flashback shows a hooded figure entering through a door on the side of a building, guarded by robots] Unfortunately, we were still programmed for violence. [the flashback shows robots surrounding a wrestling ring. In the ring, a robot and One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two. Okay, robots, all the number ones, go stand on that platform over there. And all the number twos, just turn around and face the wall. [All the robots assigned as number twos turned around and faced the wall] And no peeking! We were programmed to follow her commands 100%, but through sheer force of will, I was able to overcome it. [ Number twos! Chop, chop! [the robots assigned as number twos walk onto the platform. Rattleballs tries to pull out his sword. The robots are then squished. The banana guards take the metal box away. Rattleballs escapes] I alone escaped, while my compatriots became minimalist furniture. [motions to metal cube] Oh, sorry! [stands up off the metal cube] I've lived as a fugitive in this junkyard ever since. That is why you must never tell Princess Bubblegum about me. If she ever found out, she would have me destroyed. Rattleballs is still what?! He asked me not to tell you, but I cannot break my oath to serve you, my lady, 100%. Captain Root Beer Guy, [Root Beer Guy in police uniform walks in] assemble my guard! [Root Beer Guy salutes] Hello, Princess. Sorry Ree-B-Z. My oath to the princess comes first, but once you two talk it out, I know she'll see you mean no harm. Banana Guards, destroy! So be it! [ Wait! [The Banana Guards charge at Rattleballs] CHARGE! [Rattleballs takes out his sword, and circled the sword on the ground to dust the air.] WEEWOOWEEWOO! [Rattleballs charges at a Banana Guard. The dust clears and four banana guards surround Rattleballs] CHARGE! [The banana guards charge at Rattleballs. Rattleballs smites them simultaneously. He creates a dust cloud and jumps high in the sky]  RB, don't! You think I'm dangerous, Princess? Dang right I do! You killed all my banana guards! No, Princess, look! They're only bruised! Hey, you hit me! I no longer crave mindless violence. I have found peace in meditation, gardening, egg throwing. I also hope time has made you less bloodthirsty, princess, but do with me as you will. In my heart I still serve you, 100%. Bigger pimples mean bigger dimples, so mash- [Princess Bubblegum comes in the room with a wheelbarrow holding a metal cube] Ahem! Okay, everyone, [Takes out the metal cube from the wheelbarrow] I took care of Rattleballs. [A banana guard places his drink on the metal cube. The Banana Guards are impressed] Oh! Wow! Cool! [another banana guard] Show's back on! Everything's settled. I don't have to go back on my order, and you can protect the kingdom from the shadows. Thank you, Princess. That's marginally better than hiding in a dump. [He is about to jump out of the window] Wait! [she comes closer to Rattleballs and blesses him with the sword] I dub thee Sir Rattleballs! [Rattleballs smiles as [moans] What's wrong with you, man? I ate all the candy in your backpack, and now I'm sick. I didn't bring any candy. Oh, no. That explains why it didn't taste right. Nothing tastes right today. Like, I thought we were going to get into some serious flavor with these sand people, but they're just standing around like garnish. That's how I feel—like a dying parsley. So what's goin' on with the spoon? Marceline and the spoon. Um... [looks at the spoon on top of the column] nothing. [The spoon is lifted up and comes down.] Wait, there she goes! [invisible] Yo, wake up, sand dude. [taps a sand soldier with the spoon, causing the sculpture to crumble.] I think they're dead. [brings spoon over to Finn and becomes visible] A spoon. [takes spoon] Yea-uh. The Spoon of Prosperity! It doesn't look like mu—[belches] Oh, my gosh, I feel so much better! Hungry, even. Guys, let's go home! We've gotta get this spoon to Princess Bubblegum first. [running off] ♪Let's rock!♪ What's PB want with that spoon, anyway? Beats me. Sometimes it's better not to know. Yeah, I guess that's true with Bonnibel. Hey, guys, look what I found! [starts sinking in the sand] Is that quicksand? Yeah! [laughs] [tries to get out several times but keeps falling back] Heh. Quicksand is pretty fun. Heh. Quit messing around, Jake. Okie-doke. Whoa! Hmm. Hey, is this whole place made out of sand? Sure looks that way. Uh, give me a pull, please. [stretches his upper body to Finn and Marceline, who grab him and pull] [laughs] Stop, you guys are tickling me! Let me try this other thing. [shapeshifts his body into a corkscrew] Flesh drill! I'm not sure that's a good idea— [screams] Yaah! Rug burn! Ow! Ow! Aah! [escapes the quicksand] Whoo! It worked! Whoa! Check it out! My piggies are free. [wiggles toes] You just demolished half the underground city! Yeah, only half. You also sealed our exit. Our only exit. [groans] [drops Jake] No regre-e-e-ets! [tumbles down a hill] I'm sorry. [touches his toe] This little piggie stayed home, and so should have I. I know! I'll dig us out of here. No! You'll bury us alive! Undead! [takes out his holo-pendant] Oh, hi, Finn. Princess, we're trapped in the underground city. Yeah-yeah. That sounds great. Huh? No, we need help! That's great! [display glitches] Gre-gre-great! Great, great! [sighs] Guess we lost the signal. [puts away pendant] Any more bright ideas? Snacks! How are snacks gonna get us out of here? I wanna eat snacks... because I am hungry. I'm hungry, too. Bust the snacks, Finn. Bust, bust, bust! Hey, where are my red erasers? They were in here. Uh-oh. I thought they were candy. You... ate all... MY RED?!?! Oooh. I'm sorry! Calm down, Marceline. There's gotta be some red stuff in these ruins. I'll go explore. You guys hang out here and save your energy. Thanks, Finn. [walking off] Be cool. [eats cookie] So how hungry are you? [hisses] Aah! [cowers] I'm sorry. Please don't eat my blood! [sighs] Jake, I don't want to hurt you, but you should know things get crazy when I'm hungry. Like... how crazy? I'm gonna go into feral mode. [sighs] It's not gonna be pretty. [whimpers] [eats the rest of his cookie] I know. Let's tie me up. That way, you won't be scared. And that will keep you from draining my bloods? Not physically, no, but as a prop, I think it'll be good for both of us. You know, psychologically. [gulps] [whispers] Hurry, Finn. Red, red, red. I guess even a vampire queen's face would melt off if she tried to eat lava. Get me a bucket of lava, Jake. [eating a sandwich] Yo, you know better than that. Do iiiit... Don't go crazy, okay? I'm frickin' hungry. [gulps] Why did you leave me here, dude? [bites sandwich] Okay, here we go. Yeah, look at that! [points to red glow] Something crazy red behind this door. Hmm. [looks at skeletons] Why are y'all holding this door shut? You don't look like sand peeps, neither. More like wisemen-zerts . Oh, well. Gotta feed the Marcy monster. [walks up to door] 'Scuse me. Up, sorry. Okay. Uhh... hi-yah! [kicks the door, which collapses] Oh, dag. Cool... What the heck happened here? [grabs a hat from one of the skeletons] Whoop! [throws hat in the red light, which turns it to sand] Ew. Whoops. Y'alls got turned into sand people. Don't go in the light. Go like this. [walks along the edge of the room] Around it. Next time, you guys. Hmm... [sees that the source of the light is coming from a hole behind the skeleton] Whatever's down there's gotta have red blasting out of every hole. Hey, you're not still alive, right? Okay. I was just making sure. [crawls into hole] Bet that guy was a creep. [continues crawling] This hole is deep. Oh, my Glob. Oh, my Glob, where are you, man? Marcy's wiggin' out! Jaaaake... What? I can smell your insides, Jake. [laughs] They smell... [sniffs deeply] red! [screams] Yeah, lemme see in there. [screams] Oh, yeah. [screams] Maybe I should go back. Well, I've already gone this far. [reaches the end of the tunnel, where a red gem is shining light] Shebang! That oughtta be enough red to un... [notices that the red light is coming from a large turtle creature behind the gem] Oops. Paris? Is that you? You mean the guy with the big thing on his head? Yes. Have you returned to complete the plan? Naw. Paris is, like, super dead. What?! No! How long? Dude, like, a really long time. Like five hundred years. [in disbelief] Five hundred—[sighs] Chum! I must've zoned out! What the heck were you two doing? Once we turned the city to sand, we were gonna reanimate their bodies and conquer my homeland at the center of the planet. Hm, that's dumb. Time to go back home a true loser. Can I have this big ol' ruby, then? That's an emerald. Clearly it's a big ol' ruby. I don't know what to tell you, man. I would like the ruby. It's yours, buddy. [gets up] I'm outties. [backs out]] Peace. Hyup! [jumps down and tries to pull the ruby out] [strains] [farts] Whoops. Okay, [pats sand] all done now. Nice and snug, right? Jake... [gulps] What? I won't be able to... to control myself much longer. I can feel the feeding frenzy coming on. [licks teeth] I just wanna let you know I'm sorry. [laughs evilly] You're sick! Yeah... [laughs] C'mon, What? [laughs] [licks lips] [straining] [stops and cries a little] [resumes pushing] [panting] [digs a lava moat around Marceline] What are you doing? I'm cooking up a crazy vampire! That should heat up nice! The sand will keep the meat moist. You're gonna eat me? You was gonna eat me! Yes, I am. [laughs] [blows lava] Cook, baby, cook! Finn! [falls to the ground, exhausted] Bleh. The trick is rollin' it. Phew! Check out this ruby I got. That's an emerald, dude. You too now?! Emeralds are green, boyee. This thing is green. Why is everybody messin' with me? It's like a dark gray-ish red. Mostly gray. Sometimes red things are gray! You're a little colorblind... and there's nothin' to be ashamed of! Oh... whoops. I'm sorry you had to push that thing so far. Uh, what's goin' on with Marcy? She was threatening to eat my insides, so I'm cooking her. I know that sounds crazy, but I had no choice. I'm operating on my lowest survival brain function right now. What? [looks behind him to see that Marceline is gone] [gasps] Chill, man! No, we gotta book! [pushes Finn into tunnel] Go! [floating near the ceiling] Go where, Jake? [laughs] I gotta suck out your insides first, right? Nay-nay, brah! [babbles] Time to eat! [The ceiling rumbles.] Huh? What the—? Bubblegum? Hey, guys. I saw my seismograph had gone off the charts, so I figured you might be in trouble, right? Yeah, but watch out for Marceline. She's gone rabid! What? Marceline's gonna rap for me? [screams] [gasp] [sighs] Woof. Thanks, Bonnie. That's enough low-grade red to get me home, at least. Come on, guys. Let's go. Are you alright, PB? [weakly] Did you get the Spoon of Prosperity? [takes it out of his pack] Yeah, here you go. [hands it to her] Whoa. Peeps will never starve in my eternal empire. Sand worm, up! Ach! Where the turd is my Demonic Wishing Eye?! Grrrr... [kicks clothing] I've looked everywhere! Ugh... Wenk! What is it, girl? Wenk. [Points off screen] You know where it is? Lead the way! Oh boy, this is just wonderful! [Gunter leads him to a brush on a table. [Starts pacing] What are my options here? Hmm. Hm-hm. [Walks into Gunter] Gunther! What is your damage today? [Gets an idea] Ooh! Wizard market! [Flies over to his computer and starts typing] W-I-Z-... Hey! [Gunter blocks the light with his fin again] You're really peeving me off, Gunther! Go stand in the corner! I said stand in the corner. Ugh. You make me sick. [Flies toward the entrance of the castle] Try not to break anything while I'm gone. [Sitting up] Gunther? [Penguin shakes its head] Uhhh... [more penguins surround him] Jake? We gots penguins. [Snores, wakes up] Hm-huh? Hmm? Oh, yeah... [hugs one in his bed] thanks... Come on, you guys! Get off me, now. [Arms raised] Wah! Wah! Grah! [Changing to look like Finn and grabbing his arms] Wah! Wah! Grah! Jake? Huh? [Penguins grab him, [In between slaps] Glip... driggle! [Struggling with a penguin] Eh... What's with these super penguins? [Punching a penguin] I don't know! I'm guessing it's the Ice King. [Getting slapped] Well, where is he, then? ICE KIIIIING! [Penguin slaps him] Wizards rule. [Humming to himself] Doot-doo, deet-dee-doo. Ah, let's see. [Looks at sign above shop door, says to himself] That's the symbol for magic items, right? [To Huntress Wizard standing nearby] Hey, this is the magic items shop, right? What's it look like, ya donk? I know that, I know! Why can't they write it on the sign, though? Why's it all gotta be secret? Let's just put it all out there, huh? Equal distribution of magic to the people! [Chanting] No more symbols! No more initiations! [Normal voice] Ya feelin' me, Huntress Wizard? [Playing with an arrow] You tryin' to get killed, Ice King? Uh-uh, I was just steppin' to ya, girl, with my intellectual wizard politics. [Huntress Wizard walks off. ...So then he was telling me to beef in the eye of Glob and stuff. Whoa. Did you do it? Heck yes, I did. Yo, I wouldn't do that. Get over it, man. Don't you want to reach the highest initiation of the secret schools? Of course, man. In shadow, we find the light... [Other wizards join in, chanting] safely sealed in darkest night. So make sure y'all keep it tight. Wizards only, fools. [Entering room] Keep what tight? A secret you never should've heard, Ice King. [Wizards advance toward him] Yo. Guys. Chill. I lost my Demonic Wishing Eye. [ [Charging up magic] Loose lips sink the ships, Ice King. Sorry, man. [Charges up] Nothing personal. Oh, slid— [Bufo shoots at him] You guys! [Shoots ice at the wizards] Ah! [Forest Wizard shoots branches at him] Whoa! [Being crushed] Okay, I give up. Gunther?! [Sees Demonic Wishing Eye] Nice ice! What's goin' on here, man? Call off your super bros. [Sarcastically] Well, that's great. Where's the Ice King, Gunther? [Gunter levitates out the door] Gunther?! What? Alright. [Penguins follow Gunter] Whoa! WHAAAA! Is this happening everywhere? I don't know—lemme see. [Stretches his arm inside and upstairs and brings down a telescope] Whoop! [Looks into telescope] Dang! What do ya see? Hold on. [Looks in another direction] Oh no! NO! What, dude?! [Looks in another direction] Hold on, man. Wait. Oh, Glob! This can't be happening! [Kicks Jake over] Tell me! Eh, it's over. We've been conquered. Who's been conquered? Everyone. [Scratching head] By the Ice King? No, dude! By Gunther. Holy shmow! Gimme that! [Grabs telescope, looks through it, gasps as he sees Gunter floating toward the Candy Kingdom] Gunther's heading for the Candy Kingdom! We gotta save them! [Breaks telescope in two] [Finn jumps on him, Hurry, Jake! Wait—I'm still in my pajayjays. Yo, Finn, are you seeing these penguins? Yeah, it's Gunther! He's taking over the whole thing! Well, he'll have to beat my Banana Guards and my Gumball Guardians. That's not gonna work. What did he say? He says your plan is bunk. Well, what's your plan? I got a plan. You do? When we get there, I'll do my plan in addition to your plan. Two plans. Laters. Uh, alright, so you're not gonna tell me your— [Hangs up] I'm outies! You're not gonna tell her the plan? No, I gotta be mysterious. What? I thought you weren't into Bubblegum anymore. I'm not. But this is how I act now with all the ladies, you see? I keep 'em in a state of confusion. That way, I've always got options in case Flame Princess doesn't work out. OH MY GOSH! Where is this coming from?! It's called "future farming." I read it in that book you have by Jay T. Doggzone. Jay T. Dogg—awww, dude! Don't read that book! It's gonna mess up your brain. I keep that book around for laughs. It's all really bad advice. Oh, okay. I'll stop it, then. No, well... you can still be mysterious—that's fine. What? Now I'm confused. [Arriving at the Candy Kingdom] Never mind—I didn't say nothin'. Hey P-Bubs! Are you ready? Yes. The calvary [sic] is standing by. Cool. I'm gonna rally some citizens and do this other plan. Okay, but what—? [Walking off] Good luck! Jake, what's with all the mystery? Uhhh... [Snaps] Oh snap, look out! Banana Guards, defend! Aw, jeez. [Rising] Evil presence detected. Must defend candy. Dange—[a mass of penguins formed to make a giant knocks him down] aaah! You'll never get past these walls... I think. [Standing by bottles] This... is my plan. I got the Candy Kingdom underground to help me collect all the bottles in the land. Breaking news that mystery plan of yours is a smash hit. [Laughs stupidly] Because the—of the glass... I guess all they care about is bottles, huh. But what'll happen when they run out of bottles? I won't let that happen, Prubbs. [Sustaining note] We-e-e-e-e-enk... Stay back! [Unsheathes sword] Wait a minute! [Penguins stop quacking] Put away your weapons and we'll get you more bottles. Peeb! There aren't any bottles left! I have a third plan. So, we make them new bottles. Then the Gunthers break the bottles, and then we pick up the glass and make new bottles again? Yup. What, like, forever? Yes. Bubb, your plan... bunks. Heh, yeah. I like it. I got a rhythm goin'! [Says 'tink' as he reassembles each piece of a bottle] [Points to upwards] Wenk! [Gumball Guardians are seen standing behind He wants to smash the Gumball Guardian's head! We're going to make more bottles. Just wait, okay? NO! [On ground] Goodbye... Princess! Hey. What's goin' on here? Why's this place all crazy? I was just flying by and— [sees Gunter, gasps] Gunther! You took my stuff! Wenk. That's bad. You know what you get now?! [Sadly] Wenk. That's right, you get the squirty-squirts. [Squirts spray bottle at Gunter] Bad, bad. Now take off my Demonic Wishing Eye. Alright, Gunther. Now go home. [Walks off] Wenk. That's right, walk. And while you're walking home, you think about what you did. [Sighs] It's getting worse and worse with him. He just—he hates it when I leave the castle. I'm sorry, guys. Uh, dude? Where have you been? Yeah, and why are you all jacked up? Heh... well, I got into some crazy wiz biz over in Wizard City. Honestly, I don't even know how I survived. Basically, it was the craziest showdown ever. I—[catches himself] I wish I could tell you all about it, but you know—"Wizards only, fools." Keep it tight. [Both scream] Oh. Heh heh. What? Where are we? I dunno. What did we do last night? Mayhaps we drank juice of the Elder Toad. Eh, I doubt it. Yo, do you see this? We're in a cage! Do you think we, like, did something wrong? Yeah, right. When did we ever did wrong actions? Get real. [takes out his cellphone] Who ya calling? I'm callin' BMO, see if he knows what happened. [mutters] Junk... My new camera phone... Wait, c'mere! What? I guess I vid-taped a buttload of stuff on here. Play it for the clues within. Okay, play. [clicks play button on his phone] Did you take it yet? Recording. Okay, get a shot of the portal. Gonna go through this biz! Alright, let's do—[screen goes blank, video ends] Oh, no! What?! Battery crunked out. Dude, do you remember any of that mess? No, but I guess we're here on purpose? So we opened a portal to somewhere, but where? [walks to the bars on the cage where a jailer demon is standing] The Nightosphere. [both scream] AHHHhhhh... You're in the Nightosphere. Are you sure? Uh, yes. You got thrown in jail. Look. [flies up to a light switch and pushes it down, lighting up cages along the walls full of howling demons] Look! [gasps] Marceline's dad! We really are in the Nightosphere! Up an' at em, people. [opens cages] Eveyone out of your cages. My shift is over, and no one's shown up, so... Whoa, wait. You're letting us go? I mean... yeah, but not really. You're in the nightosphere, so... So what? [holds up cellphone and charger] Is there an outlet somewhere for this? [laughing loudly] Hey, c'mon! Just tell us how we can get back to our world. You can't leave the Nightosphere. Not unless he let's you. [points to statue] Marceline's dad. Yeah, that's Hunson Abadeer. He runs this place. Hunson Abadeer? [giggles] Alright. Well, dude, how do we talk to him? You can't just talk to the boss. You gotta make an appointment. Yeah, but we don't even know why we're here! [holding up a banana] And what's up with this? Ugh. Oh! Oh, oh, sick! You touched that stuff?! Later, fools. [goes away] [trying to get the demons' attention] Hey! Hey! Is there an outlet anywhere? You guys... Maybe this is where they put all the dummy demons. [cuddles a caterpillar demon and talks to it in a baby-like voice] Right, big guy? You're not so smart, right? Yeah... [to Jake; normal voice] Let's go out that hole, man. Okay, get on. Mm-hm, mm-hm. Pretty neat. Whoa, look! [to his kid] Charlie, don't socialize with the smaller demons! They're dirty and stupid! Daddy! What is that? I think it's like sentient blood mist. Cool. C'mon, let's see if anyone knows where Hunson Abadeer is. Alright, well, how about that dude? [points to a one-eyed pink demon which is cut open like a cross section so you can see his guts] Okay. [to the demon and the little demons traveling on him] Yo, bros! How do we talk to Hunson Abadeer? [telepathically] The teller can help you. Get in my flipping belly, and I will transport you. My insides are habitable. You will not be digested. Bye, mister! [Looks around] Who's the teller? That guy? [He looks toward a birdlike demon in a rowboat rowing on top of the little demons. The Boat Demon bangs one of the small ones with an oar.] Okay, bozos, make room, make room, make room! Ouch! Come on! Scooch over, fatty. I can't, dude. This outbox is packed tighter than my tummy tunnel when I can't make brown on the camping trips because of my anxieties and I have IBS also. [gets hit with oar] Ow! Hey, guy, are you the teller? No, no, no, this is the line to meet the teller. No, man, are you for real? How long's the wait?! I dunno. I just like to row around on top of their heads. Bunk that! [holds up the banana] Hey, do you know about this? I... ew, no. [scoffs] Sick. Why do we need to see the teller anyway? We just wanna see Hunson Abadeer and find out what happened to us! The teller will get you in touch with Hunson Abadeer. We got systems down here. You gotta swim the proper channels, ya know? Youse ain't special! Youse gotta wait just like the rest of youse... [corrects himself] Us. [sighs] Where's the line start? Oh... I dunno. The thing sorta governs itself. [grimace as they squeeze in] Tight! Ow! [looking at the boat demon] That guy stinks. [to a big demon] Excuse me! Excuse me! Big man? Over here! Huh? What, me? Uh, yeah, how long have you been in line for? How... long? [shudders and starts crying] Oh, butt traps. Jake, stretch us to the front. NO CUTTING!!! I will kill you with all my hopes and regrets! All right, dudes, chill! We'll wait! [whistles] I can't feel my legs. SAY SOMETHING!! Say something to me!!! I... can't. I got nothing to say anymore. Just make up words then! Bloobity bloo bloo blah blee blee blah. Shree shrah... Hey, check it out. We're at the front of the line. Woohoo! [to the teller] Yo, yo! We wanna talk to Abadeer! Wha... Huh? [hands Finn a slip of paper with a number on it] When your thingy comes up, Hunson Abadeer will see you through the door. [reading from paper] 42 million?! What's the number on the door? 41 million... [mutters gibberish] We're next! Whew! Man, I thought I was gonna throw up! That's us! Yaaay! [sees that there is another extremely long line] Nooooooo! I'm gonna lose it! Waaaaaaaaaaahhh... [he continues screaming like this for quite some time] Hey, do you know if there's an outlet anywhere? No. Do you know what this is all about? [holds up banana] No... gross. What's going on, buddy? You givin' up? [sighs] I guess. You don't wanna just stick it out a little more? I don't know if my little boy heart can take it. Listen, Finn. Are you listening? Mm-hmm. Your heart may be small, but it's strong as a bull donk. And I know. You can wait through this line so we can meet Hunson Abadeer and find out why we're here, and why we're in a pile of banianials, 'cause you're a champ, OK? [shrugs] Ok. 上手で頑張ってね ("Being that you are skilled you can do it!") Well, at least I can see the end of the line, I think. Let's wait the heck out of this line! That's it, champ. [Finn starts to jog in place] Hehehehe, you're pretty pumped up. I'm super pumped! Does anyone need to go pee-pees? Go ahead. Oh, yeah, we've got questions. [gasps] Put your hand down, Finn! No way, dude, I got questions. What the hey, Jake! It's not answering questions, man. That thing is gonna bake our beans. [takes out his sword and goes on top of a rock] Hey, bloodmist cloud! What happened to us? Why can't we remember any—? Oh, it's gone. [Points to cloud] Look. Ride me, partner. [ Hey, cloud! Where's Abadeer? Whoa, look at all these paintings. I think this is Hunson Abadeer's house. Hey! Hunson Abadeer! How dare you chumps trespass here! We just wanna go home, man. Yeah, why'd you lock us up, Abadeer? When Marceline finds out about this, it's gonna stir up some heavy daddy-daughter issues. NO ONE LEAVES THE NIGHTOSPHERE! Ah, come on, man! NO ONE! NO ONE LEAVES THE NIGHTOSPHERE! Come with me, you juicy, little mortal soul! Finn! Oh, my lob, Jake! You found the portal! We don't want to hurt you, Abadeer. Just let us go. [groans] What the—? [in unison] MARCELINE?! I'm gonna close this portal. [hisses] You're forbidden to come back to the Nightosphere! But Marcy, let us help you! It's too late! Stay away from me, FOREVVVEEERRRR!!!! [the portal closes] Marceline's in trouble! We gotta go back and save her. Alright, but I'm gonna take a shower first. Hey, fart-face!! Huh? Unhand Princess Bubblegum!! Foolish interlopers! Zah! [Fires ice magic at Finn] [Evading it] Whoa! [Throws a snowball at him] Ah! Ee hee hee hee—OOH! [Gets hit by snowball] MY EYESIGHT! Huh? Hee hee hee! Hey, Ice King! I bet you'll never kiss the princess! I will kiss her! I will! [To "princess"] Hold still. [Kisses Jake's posterior] Mwah! [Laughs] You just kissed Jake's butt! What?! [Jake reforms his posterior.] EEEEGH!! [The other three laugh.] [Flying away] The hour is yours, but the day shall be mine! Just like you, Princess—MINE! What a patoot. Thanks for saving the day yet again, boys. You're welcome, Princess. [She hugs him.] Uh... [He blushes, and Jake raises his eyebrow, amused.] I'm gonna throw you two a party. Meet at the Candy Kingdom—TONIGHT! That paper crane for Princess Bubblegum? I just thought I'd bring 'er a gift... in return for throwing us this party. Heh. I bet you wish you were my butt. What? I bet you wish you were my butt, because then the princess would... No, wait... I bet you wish you were the Ice King and the princess was my butt! What?! Hmm... [Snapping] OH! I bet you wish Bubblegum would kiss you, too! Like the Ice King and my butt! Hahahaha! That's ridiculous! [ Hey, everybody. Finn and Jake are here. Who's ready to party?! What's everyone laughing at? Shh! Stand back, everyone. This style of massage is called, "Best Friend Massage." Oh, my gosh... Because it can only be done for friends. It is completely consensual. Oh, holy cow... Relax yourself now, Lumpy Space Princess... YAH! [Backflips and pounds her] Oh! I feel so great! Who is that guy? Hahaaa! Greetings, party-goers! Glad you could all make it! Princess Bubblegum! [Ricardio stares at her and he himself starts "beating" hard.] Princess. I just wanted to thank you for— [Cutting in] Oh, my gosh! PB, ya gotta check out this super cute guy. You're gonna love 'im. [They leave Finn and Jake.] Uhhh... This is... Oh. Oh, my gosh. I don't even know your name.  Whoa! No, I haven't! [Music starts up; crowd moves to the dance floor.] Wanna continue this conversation on the dance floor? [Exiting with her] It would be my pleasure, Princess. Why didn't the princess invite me to dance? If you wanna dance, just go dance! Huh, it sounds like you're dealing with some new emotions you don't understand... like jealousy. BLAAAARGH!! Look, man, just go out there and get down! [Pushes him onto the dance floor] [To Princess Bubblegum] —transmordial layers completely independent of the babylons. Eh? Wow! That would mean that the babylons would fluctuate with the piranha-nanosphere! Correct! Agh! [Goes back to Jake] They're talkin' about science, man! I can't compete with that! Do the Science Dance! Remember it? It was sorta like this. [Does it] Wah unh we ah eeh... You think that'll work? Yeah! Probably. [Pushes him back onto the dance floor] Do it, man! You're a pro! [Dancing] Science Dance! Science Dance! [Still talking with Bubblegum] —lower proximities to— Science Dance! Hey, eh, Princess! You wanna spend some time with me? Excuse me, Princess. You must excuse me. [Exits] Oh, uh... Alright! [To Finn] Finn, what the cabbage? I was learning about Zanoits! [Prevaricating] Oh... I'm... into Zanoits! Th-They're the best! Zanoits kill hundreds of thousands of Plantoids a year. Oh, no, not the Plantoids! Plantoids produce mellotoxin! [Finn stares.] Mellotoxin kills Zanoits!! ...So are Zanoits... good things? [Changing the subject] You're totally jealous of Ricardio. No, I'm not. I just don't like the way he talks to you. It makes me feel weird. That's jealousy, hun. [To himself] Woof! Man... This is goin' bad. Hey, Finn. You gotta come help me slay these peanut monsters at the bar. It can't wait. [He and Finn are alone.] Wow, man, what happened out there? Agh... I don't know! I was tryin' to warn 'er, but she twisted my words around and— Yeah. Ladies are twisty, man. Bubblegum's super smart, too. I know! And I can't shake this weird feeling about Ricardio. I think he's... a villain. Why? Is it because his face is so foldy and dramatic? No! I can just feel it in my gut! He's up to something sinister! Maybe what you feel is romantic rivalry. I'll prove he's a villain! How? Stakeout. Here he comes! [Viewing Ricardio and Princess Bubblegum] They're talking! Lemme see. [Gets binoculars] I can read their lips. [Mimicking Princess Bubblegum] "Hey, shorty, you should pick your boogers and then fart!" [Mimicking Ricardio] "You look kind of like a big pink baguette!" [Taking back binoculars] Get serious, Jake!! This is life and death! Is it? Don't get me wrong. I'm all about stakeouts and spying on this guy, but what if he's not a villain? What if he just looks wicked? Some people look wicked but are super nice. I gotta trust my gut! [Grabbing gut] Hmm. He's on the move! Let's roll! [The two swing onto a Guardian of the Royal Promise.] I see 'im. He's holding rope and going into the trash. He's smashing bottles—and pretending to stab someone! So... he's recycling... or what? [Takes off binoculars] I think your gut's a little naive, Jake. [Puts on binoculars] Holy moly! He's... he's with the Ice King! They're shouting something! [Ice King and Ricardio quarrel.] Ricardio is tossing him in the dumpster and running away! So I was right! He is a good guy who's just cursed to look suspicious! [To gut] You and me, gut! Together forever! Solvin' crimes and makin' up rhymes! No way. This proves he's a super-villain! More powerful than lesser villains like the Ice King! Then it's settled! We're gonna confront Ricardio face-to-face and prove he's evil! Or good! Oof! So what're you doin', Ricardio? Are you evil? Or nice with an evil face? That's none of your business. The safety of Princess Bubblegum is my business! Yeah, we just wanna know if you're evil or not. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Oh, yeah? Yeah. [Slightly annoyed] Yes! You stay away from Princess Bubblegum with all that stuff! Now that my plan is nearly complete, there is no way you could stop me. I could stop you if I wanted! Oh, yeah? Yeah! Oh, yeah?? YEEEAAAH!!! [Gasps] What's going on here? Princess?! Ricardio?! [Weakly] Yes... I'm alright, Princess. Finn... why'd you do it? He was gonna hurt you with those ropes and bottles! These were for our balbaflonic laser. It's not all his fault, Princess. I might've looked a little threatening. Finn... you shouldn't punch brainiacs. You know how fragile they are! You gotta stop this jealous business. But... C'mon, Ricardio. I'll patch you up and give you candy. [They exit.] [Sigh] She hates me now. I was totally wrong about Ricardio. No, Finn! [Emerges from dark alleyway] You were not wrong. He is evil! [Collapses] Ice King! What do you know about this? Tell me or I'll do something! Hold up, Finn! The Ice King looks sorta damaged! I don't care! I only care about Ricardio! But my enervated condition has everything to do with him. [Flashback begins; [Slapping hand away] Agh! Come on, Jake! [They run to the Candy Castle.] Gotta save the princess! Princess Bubblegum!! Princess!! [Gasps] Finn!! Jake!! You were right all along, Finn! Now I'm going to cut out Princess Bubblegum's heart and make out with it! Not if I can help it! One step closer and I'll remove her heart!! Finn! I feel like a big idiot for doubting you! He was just so engaging! ...But his knowledge on plantoids is actually pretty weak. Shut your mouth up, Princess! [Jake knocks Why don't you marry someone your own size?! Like my foot?! Huh?! And my fist?! [Crawling in] Stop! Stop it! That's my heart, you piece of— Ice King. [Ice King crawls towards Ricardio.] Should we... let 'im take his heart back? He is... villainous... I don't wanna watch an old man die on Princess Bubblegum's carpet, man. Oh, yeah... Wait! Wait! No! Come to daddy... Noooooooooo! Yeah, there you go... [Puts him in his chest] Like that? Huh? [Sinking into chest] Seeee you guys laterrrr... [Reinvigorated] I feel wonderful! Hahaha! And now that I've saved the Princess, she'll marry me and live in my dungeon every day! No, she won't! Yeah, no, I won't! Yes you WILL! [He charges up his ice magic, but Finn kicks him. He begins flying away.] Well... maybe not today... or tomorrow... but another day! Another—[Accidentally knocks head on door frame. He grunts in pain as he exits.] Thanks again for saving me... again. [Mouth full] Don't mention it. Now that Ricardio's gone, you don't have to be jealous of anyone anymore. [Winks] I never get jealous. [Romantically] Kiss me, Finn. [Finn blushes, astonished.] Ahem. [She is doing a hand-stand and wearing a Jake mask on her posterior. She uses a deeper voice.] I mean... kiss me, Finn. [Normal voice, whispering] Am I doing it right, Jake? NOOOOOOOO!!! Vroom, vroom! Kshh! Vroom, vroom, vroom! [From inside] Sweet P! [Gasps] Come and get it, Sweet P. Oh boy! Breakfast porridge. [He walks over and begins eating.] Mmm. I think I must have the most perfect life in the whole world. Oh, that's lovely. What about you, Mama? Is your life perfect? Me? [She looks up at the wind blowing through the apple trees, and tears form in her eyes.] Yes, Sweet P. I'm the happiest mama in the whole world. Oh no, mama! You're sad! No, no, sweetie. That's just something that happens when grown-ups think about their lives for too long. [From inside] Honey, can you get that? Thanks, sweetie. [Answers phone] Hello? [On phone] Tree Trunks? Tree Trunks, it's me, [Quietly] Randy? Forgive me for being so bold, but Tree Trunks, I must see you. I don't think that's a very good idea, Randy. Tree Trunks, please! Um, okay, hold on. [She hangs up.] Who was that, sweetie? That was, uh, the school. There's a parent-teacher conference I need to go to. Really? Isn't it my turn this time? No, because, um... it's my turn...? Well, if you say so. Be back soon. [Concerned] Okay. Uh, bye. The future's wild. We did it, babe. We finally graduated high school. Yes, Randy, we did. [Clears throat] Tree Trunks, would you sign my yearbook? I sure will, Cookie. Do you want me to sign on my fencing photo, my Homecoming Queen photo, my horseback riding club photo- [Interrupting] Would you sign your swim team photo? Yes. That's my favorite. [She signs the book.] When you get done with that kid stuff, let me know. I got grown-up stuff to discuss. I was about to say the same thing to you. [She hands the yearbook back to Cookie with a wink.] Randy, I've decided to take some time for myself and see the world. I'm eighteen and I need adventure, Randy. I need- [She notices Randy is climbing down from his chair.] What? Baby... [Gasps and drops her yearbook.] ...let me be your adventure. Okay, why not? Kiss her, son! Our wedding photos are here. Just in time for the honeymoon. Babe? [From the far end of the dock] It's over, Randy. I'm a wild child. [She dives into the ocean and begins swimming away into the horizon.] Goodbye. "Goodbye, Randy." [Chuckles] Okay. Hmm? Oh, Randy, I'm so sorry you went to all this trouble. Huh? I mean, I'm flattered, but I have a family now and I can't run away with you. That... Tree Trunks, that's not why I asked you here. It's not? No. I just wanted to ask you for my grandmother's ring back. Oh. I'm going to propose to my girlfriend this weekend. I've got the chocolates, and the flowers, but I need that ring. Well, I'm sorry, but I threw that ring down a bottomless pit. Oh no! No, wait, that's not right. I used that ring to propose to my second husband, Danny. Oh, no. [Sensually] Oh, Danny. [Narrating] At sea, I made a new life for myself. Mr. Faidutti. Yes, Captain Tree Trunks. Mr. Faidutti, pick up that mop, you bug. [Looking at his butt] Mm hmm. Captain Tree Trunks, we're approaching a ship off the port bow! Good. [She goes to look.] Drown all but the tightest men. [Shouting up from a small sailboat] No! Impudence. I beg of you, madam, while I am tight, my brother is not, and yet I love him. Hmm. My name is Daniel Prince and this is my brother, Peanut. Please look into your heart and pity him, for though our family is quite wealthy, he has had a difficult life. [Subtly loosening his shirt] You are a very beautiful elephant, but I fear your bandit ways have made you hard. [Narrating] He was right. I left my post that very day so that I could spend the rest of my life with Danny. [Narrating] That evening, we were wed. [Mumbling incoherently, acting as the wedding's officiator. His eye falls out.] Peanut? [Distracting her] Kiss my mouth, baby! Yeah! [Narrating] My joy, however, would be short-lived. Was Danny smooth? Yes. [She leaves the tent.] Was Danny tight? Yes. [She approaches "Peanut".] But was he a liar? Yes, yes, yes! [She tugs at "Peanut", revealing that he is actually two crew members in disguise.] Ah! [Scuttling up a tree] Woop woop woop woop woop. [Narrating] A liar in cahoots with Mr. Faidutti to get me away from my ship. [Narrating] I marooned Danny, and I kaboomed Mr. Faidutti. No more tight men. That Danny was really, really, really something. Okay, I get it. But what about the ring? What happened next? I savvily invested my pirate treasure and became a powerful shipping magnate. Come in. Uh, I'm Oh, again? Throw those in the trash. Okay, ma'am. [He approaches the trashcan and begins trying to stuff the flowers in head-first.] They're a little - a little big. Oh, boy. The other way, like a vase. [Narrating] He melted my heart. Hey-hey! Somebody kiss me now! [Narrating] I sold the company and gave all my money to the King of Ooo. Swim with me, Wyatt, you sweet boy. [She strips naked.] Oh, uh- [Laughs] I'm never wearing clothes again! [She runs into the waves.] I, uh, might keep my shirt on. [Narrating] I thought Glob had told me, "Here's someone who needs your love." But what he really must've said was, "Go suck an egg, No more pie. But that's my pie. You're draining my life away. [Yelling anxiously] Take care of me! No. You've emptied me of my joie de vivre. [Whinging, hitting himself, crying] I've got the ring! If I don't give it back, it means we're still in love! [He exits the house.] I'm throwing it in a bottomless pit! Wyatt threw my ring in a pit? Yeah, sorry about that. Uh- huh? Mr. Pig, what are you doing here? I followed you because I was afraid that - And now I see you- Oh, no. I just wanted my grandma's ring back. And I just didn't want you to worry over nothing. R-Really? Oh, geez. There you are! [He emerges from a vent.] How could you, Tree Trunks? Wyatt? You've been following me? You wish, babe. I've been following him [points at Randy] to you! But if Tree Trunks is gonna be stepping out on her man with one of her exes, it's gonna be me! [He tries to tackle Randy but slips on a piece of ceiling tile and falls to the ground, groaning.] Tree Trunks, help me. I need you. [Spots the ring hanging on a string around Wyatt's neck.] My ring! Just give me... My suck-suck ring. Aha! Gotcha! [He exits, laughing gleefully.] Um, I'm sorry I didn't trust you. I just know you've had a lot of adventures in the past and things are kind of boring now. It's true. I sometimes miss those wild times, but back then, I couldn't even tell the difference between a good adventure and a bad one. I was just a leaf in the wind, blown about by my whims. But now I'm on solid ground. You and Sweet P are my - uh- Your greatest adventure? Yeah. Whoa, what the..? Is that Wyatt? Tree Trunks? What the heck is going on in here? Tickle, tickle, tickle. Wakey, wakey, wake. Wow, that was really something. Really something. Sure, I'll hold. Hello? I'd like to take a few minutes of your time to tell you about an amazing vitamin supplement. But first, just let me ask you do you ever feel that no matter what you eat, you're still tired and sluggish and... filled with nagging anxiety and doubt... and...? Root Beer guy, get your head back in the game! Hello, ma'am, I'd like to take a few minutes of your time... hello? What we need is to cut out the middle man. Hey, Root Beer Guy Hey. Dude, we should start our own place. Next stop, Lollipop Park Estates. This is good. What is this? Candy... [yawns] I've got a closing argument tomorrow, Root Beer Guy. I knew there was trouble. I could smell it on the hot evening breeze. Fortunately for me, trouble is my favorite thing because I'm Joe Milkshake. I kicked down the door with one swift, decisive motion... No... With one swift and decisive motion, I kicked down the door... No... The door was kicked down by me swiftly with not many motions, but a whole lot of decisiveness was used by me that was apparent to everybody... oh. What are you doing? Let me go! No! Yeah. Hey, hey, are you awake? Not really. Well, this is going to sound crazy, but I think I saw Princess Bubblegum get kidnapped and the perpetrators were that Finn and Jake! Okay, sweetie, that sounds like an interesting dream. But it did happen. You need to eat something before you go to work. And you can't keep falling asleep at your typewriter; it's bad for your back. Besides, I miss you at night. I'm sorry, sweetie. I couldn't stop thinking about that weird stuff I saw last night when I was peeking through the bushes. Peeking through the bushes?! You've been warping your mind with all this mystery stuff. I swear, sometimes I think you love that novel of yours more than you love me. You've been working on it every night for ten years and for WHAT? Look at me, Root Beer Guy. I'm a I didn't know what to say, but Joe Milkshake never was a talky guy. On my way to work that morning, I decided to take a second look at the crime scene. Root Beer Guy. Root Beer Guy. Root Beer Guy, how many bottles of products you've sold this month? Zero? Great, you can count to zero. You know, maybe if you give me the new lead... Hmph, you haven't earned the new leads. It's easier to do it when you have all the leads. Exactly. Hey, Root Beer Guy. It's all about the leads. See? I told you, it's candy stucco. Stucco feels great. Mmm, when you're right you're right. Alright, you two, what were you doing last night with Princess Bubblegum? Um, we were at home last night. Yeah, we were doing that... thing. That was a great thing we were doing at home with no other witnesses. But we're each other's witnesses. Yeah! [high five] But I saw you. [hushed] Look, man, you didn't see nothing. Mr. Banana Guard, you gotta arrest those guys. Come on! These are the guys, they're kidnappers. You have to arrest them and find out how they're hiding Princess Bubblegum. Princess Bubblegum? She's right around the corner. Oh princess Bubblegum! [tries to imitate her] Yes? [normal voice] I think some banana guards want to speak with you. Where are those Banana Guards? Your highness. Greetings, your majesty. Your skin is looking lovely today. I'm using this marmalade spray-on tan... Bingo bango. This was my lucky break. With one decisive motion, I kicked down the door. [ So... being tan is my thing now... Quickly, I scanned the room for the... oh man. Caramel Court, Cotton Candy Prison, Lollipop Park Estates! Bingo ban... Aha! Huh? Umph. Bingo bango. Bonsoir, monsieur (Good evening, sir). Would you like me to turn down ze bed? Um, look what I got! This security tape will show that Finn and Jake kidnapped Princess Bubblegum. Finn and Jake would never do that! Oh, yeah? Prepare to have your mind blown! After I put this tape in the VCR just to make sure I got the right one. I'm pretty sure I did! Hey, yes, this is it! Bingo bango! I've gotta get to the... Are you in the tub, sweetie? I'm going out! I've gotta get this tape to the Banana Guards or the newspaper or maybe the DA or something! Hey, Root Beer Guy. [Jake takes the tape away.] You were not supposed to view this tape. But... but... how did you guys know? I told them. That's right, I did it for us. Oh, this thing is eating you alive, Root Beer Guy! But it's all I've got! Hey, this looks kinda personal. Mr. Pudding. Oh, you can just call me Buck. Oh, Buck, those. No need to be formal here, son. T-those guys were just in here, can you tell me what they bought? Well, let's see. A shovel, a saw, some plastic bags, some duct tape, a bludgeon, a mop, rubber glove. Say, Mister Buck, do you know anything about this Lake Butterscotch? A right nice spot, Lake Butterscotch. Miles from where anyone can hear a person scream... if a person was screaming for some reason. Creepy now that I think about it. Nothing up there these days but some abandoned caverns. Nice place to hide a body if you're into that sort of thing. Son, now what are you doin' in my pickup truck? Yeah? Don't hang up! Uh, I'm Uh... and I took a boat out after 8 o' clock. Emergency! Quickly, Lake Butterscotch! Use the licorice lace lasso! Oh, my word. Get those guys. They're my accomplices. Oh, okay. I got it! Busted, you boat crimer. Finn and Jake? Well, guys. It looks like you caught us. Okay, Princess, you can come out now. Princess! Uh, yeah, it is the princess! Congratulations. Whee! Whee! You were so good at solving the case. Um... what case? The fake kidnapping! To test the Candy Kingdom security system. We didn't solve that case. But if you weren't following the clues I left, who was? Um, Root Beer Guy! Then why the jumping jay is he in handcuffs?! That was a great night , baby. We haven't danced like that in years! I'm so proud of you, Mr. Captain of the Banana Guards. BMO, when is something going to happen? Shh. Just watch. It happens once a month—I promise. [yawns] [pointing] This is it! Oooooh. But where does it go? That's none of our business. Tickets! Get your tickets here! See the world's greatest tiny circus! Witness the amazing wood-eating termite! The mighty strong-ant! You're late, Blue Nose! Get into makeup! [cheers and applauds] [laughs mockingly] [boos and hisses] You stink! [cries] [to Blue Nose] Too much artsy, not enough fartsy. We talked about this, clown! [to audience] Heh-heh, wasn't that something? Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, you're perfectly safe. But at this time, I'd like to ask anyone with a medical condition to please leave the premises at once. What you're about to witness with your own eyes may shock and astound you to your very core. Tonight, I give you the wildest, most dangerous beast anywhere in captivity! The horrible, the stupendous... [cracks whip] Goralina! [cracking whip] [laughs] Attagirl! [to son] Don't worry, Junior. It's all part of the act. Blue Nose! Boy, am I glad to see you. Come in, come in! Sit down. You did good out there tonight with the belly-dancing routine. Real good. Aw, don't give me that look. I know we said we were going to let the chipmunk go at the end of last season, but Goralina is our big draw. You understand that. We're barely breaking even here—what do you want from me?! Look, there's another show in an hour. You come up with an act that can rival Goralina, then we can talk. But look what she got us last night three whole pennies. Think you can make me this kind of cash? You do that, I won't need the chipmunk anymore. I'll let her go, just like I promised. But you're gonna have to lose the fancy-schmancy stuff and [pounds table] give the people what they want! Get it?! [laughs] [pleased] The old Blue Nose magic. [laughs] [laughs] [to son] Aren't you glad we came back for the second show? [laughs, cheers, and applauds] [throws pennies into the arena] Oho! You were great, kid! That's what I'm talking about. With you and the chipmunk in the show, we're gonna have a real one-two punch! Hey... I know what I said, but I want to see how many boxcars this gravy train has on it. Look at her. It's like looking at a big, sad dollar sign. [gasps] Yipe! [laughs, cheers, applauds] Whoa-ho! [laughs] [sees Blues Nose coming for him] Oh! [laughs] That's right. Lift with your legs first, then put your back into it. There he is. Gotcha! Thought you could skip out, eh? and start your own circus! Yeah, you! You and your corny clown hat! [takes off Blue Nose's hat and rubs it in his face, turning the frown upside down] Hey, he's smiling! [slaps Blue Nose] [slaps him] What's so funny? You rat! [slaps him] [slaps him] You creep! What's the big joke? [gasps and murmurs] [laughs] Ha ha! Neat! Birthday boy-e-e-e! Enjoying your party? It's great having fun with all my friends. Well, some of my friends mostly Banana Guards. Yeah, sorry about that. The Candy Kingdom is in full lockdown until I can sort out the rumors about my Uncle Gumbald. He's been gone for years, but we should stay vigilant. Don't worry, PB. Now that I'm 17, I'm feelin' ready for anything. Feels like I'm really hitting my stride, y'know? Finn, I want to give you your gift before I forget. It's a harmonica. Awesome! [Inhales deeply] Finn, I designed an exciting new game for you. Show me. It's called "Birthday Boyfighter. [Game music plays] Looks like another hit. Finn, I got you a present too. It has emotional and metaphorical significance. It's beautifully wrapped. Wonder what it is. It's an elk's heart. Oh, cool. I don't have one of those. What's that sound? It's zombies. Sounds like hooves. Zombie cows. You're green! I'm the That's some axe. Am I an axe guy though? I've always thought of myself as a sword guy. But only if you play me a game for it. What's the game? Oh, this game is called "All you have to do is strike me with it, and it is yours." Mm? [Inhales deeply] I can't axe some stranger. Wait a minute! Where's Jake? I know what's going on. No, I don't think you do. Relax, Princess. Jake loves playing birthday pranks on me. Yes, of course One of Jake's classic pranks. Okay, I'm in. May your aim be steady. [Laughs] Sure thing Jake! [ [Cheers] Yeah, Finn! Yeah, Finn! Happy birthday, Finn. [Shrieks] Jake! When did you Whose head did I Are you pranking me? What? No. My prank is this fake-out gift. Huh? What's this guy's deal? Oh, nuh-uh! Banana guards, surround him! And be on the lookout for anything else strange! Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup! Surrender, please. Princess, is that strange? Yes! I did good. [Screams as they get thrown around] My guards! I got this. Raah! [Axe handle turns into an eel and hisses] Eel! [ [Shouts] [Groans] Aw. He might have an invisible shield. But I'm not sure, because it's invisible. Owiee. Yes. It's an invisible shield. An invisible shield. I've got a device for the dissolution of invisible shields. Impossible. [Laughs maniacally] Heh! Back off, everyone. He's using some advanced mystery tech. [Laughs maniacally] Okay, let's talk. [Laughs maniacally] What do you want to talk about? Where did you come from? Why are you playing this weird game with Finn? [Laughs maniacally] [Laughing continues] He's playing Mr. Laughing Silent Guy. Game's over, bro. The game isn't over until I strike you. Hmm. Let's come up with a better way to settle this, like reasonable late teens. I'm listening. Well, we've got everything set up for party games. How about if I beat you two out of three, you got to answer our questions. Psst! Nuh! And if I win chop, chop. Deal. Wait, Finn, I think he's plotting something. I-It's fine. I'm 17. I'm hittin' my stride. Hey, Green Knight, why are they all mimey? Ah, just to keep things fair. I don't think he can hear us. [Laughs ominously] Okay, guy. Why don't we start with something basic like balls and coconuts. Hup! Hup! Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup. Ba-ba-ba-boom! Boom! [CHEERING] Okay, Finn! Yeah, yeah! You got it, Finn! You go, boy! [Slow motion] Boooooooom! [Horse Belches] [Slow motion ends] Aw, what? I'll let you have that one, 'cause I'm a big boy today. But let's see you try and beat four out of five, huh? How do you like them coconuts? [Mutters to himself] I hate them coconuts. Something's wrong. Yeah, I swear that looked fake. It was. I saw it all with my Huntress vision. Finn is totally getting played. [Inhales deeply] All right. You got a freaky curveball, man. But can you climb a greasy pole? A greasy pole?! It's hard enough climbing a non-greasy pole! Ready? [Chuckles] Mm-hmm! One, two, three, go! [Grunts] Ha, ha! [Panting] Huh? Finn, you climb so good. I guess you win this round. Hmm. Yay, Finn! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! That's right! Yay, yay! Now's our chance, BMO. I-Is Finn gonna be okay? He's got this. He's 17. Who's the ma-a-an? Who's the 17-year-old ma-a-a-an? [ [Muffled] Don't do it! Wait, don't do it! Not a good idea! Very well. Hmm How about a game of some good old-fashioned arm wrestling? Arm wrestling, huh? I see what you did there. My guns are obviously weak as heck from climbing that greasy pole. If only I had some kind of [Whirrs] superhuman robot arm. Bam! Three, two, one, go! [Strained cry] Ahh! You can't tell from my face, but I am smiling triumphantly. Nooo! It's my birthday! I know. It's my birthday, too. Fern? Oh, no! No! Finn! [Chuckles] Finally, I win! [The Fern! We've seen enough. [Groans] Finn! Finn! Finn, are you all right? I love you, Finn! Quick, eat this elk's heart. What is this? It's a family reunion. Uncle Gumbald, Cousin Chicle, Aunt Lolly. How are you back?! Here's a hint [Mimics Lumpy Space Princess’s voice] "Oh, my glob". Lumpy Space Princess. [Bubblegum remembers happenings from [(Elements]] miniseries where LSP reverts Ooo back to normal] When she reset Ooo, she reset you. For 800 years, you kept us imprisoned, Princezzin. No, you were happier as candy people. We thought we were. But don't worry it's your turn to be happy now. Get juiced. [Hisses] Back off, gumwad! The vampire girl is legitimately scary. Very well. You've witnessed our superior technology and watched your champion crushed. [Vomits] We'll go for now. [Laughs] This is my worst B-day ever. [Singing] Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you [In a seductive feminine tone] Happy birthday Mr.Finn Mert-ens [Voices reverberate] Happy birthday to you. [Flips the paper upward to reveal some writing] "I'm not talking today" [it states.] [He gives the paper a little shake to emphasize the intent.] [Smiles and reaches behind his pillow to grab a paper of his own, he holds it up] "Me too" [it states.] [Begins writing on a new paper. He flips it over] "When did you make your sign?" [Writes back] "Last night when I saw you writing yours". [Replies with] "You fancy a wager, buddy?" [Accepts] "Bringeth it on, sir!" [Hops out of his bed and onto Finn's with papers in hand.] [Flips his newly written message,] "So, what are the stakes?" [He waits for Finn's reply.] "Whoever talks first will be really disappointed" "Can we use signs?" "Yes, but only the ones we write in the next thirty seconds" [Pushes his plate away to shuffle through his signs, he finds the one he wants and flips it over,] "What's your favorite part?" [it states,] [he flips another sign] "... of the breakfast, I mean". [Pushes his plate away and looks at his signs, but before he can choose one Jake flips over another sign.] "the juice?", "the toast?", "the jam?". [By this point Finn gives an annoyed stare and shuffles through his signs some more, looking for a response. [Finally picks a sign only to have it state] "Hi, Jake" "You didn't write enough signs, did you dummy?" [Still appearing annoyed he shuffles through his signs again, only getting the following] "Thanks, Jake", "That's funny, Jake", "Nice catch, Jake", "Go get'm Jake!" [and finally,] "You the man, Jake!" [complete with thumbs up and smiley face.] [He instead flips to another sign that is revealed to be] "I love you, Jake". [Jake reacts to this by squishing his cheeks and pursing his lips with affection.] Finn, Jake, I invited some Bikini Babes over to dance to this song! [It plays "No Wonder I", a slow song, and begins to dance to it.] It's my favorite song, it makes me so happy! [Instead of saying anything they both smile at What? [Pokes Jake on the shoulder, he then points to his mouth and then at BMO, who is still confused. [Becomes agitated and crossing his arms and baring his teeth, he rapidly shakes his head. He then bops Finn on the head and covers his mouth as well as his own.] [They both look back to BMO.] [In a panic] Why are you not talking! What happened to Finn and Jake?! You have taken over their bodies! [Screaming it runs to a hole in the wall and dives in.] [Finn lifts up a sign] "Oh dang". [Inside the wall Oh oh, what should I do?! [It turns on its favorite song, grabs its knees and rocks from side to side.] BMO? [Puts her hands on her hips and looks at her wrist watch.] [Dashes to the kitchen table to pick up a sign] "I'm going in there". [He then looks through a box to find a headlamp, he quickly goes back to his signs and with a look of suspicion to Finn, he picks one up and flips it over] "Don't touch my signs". "Of course not, man". [Jake puts a skull on his signs and gives [Screams] Go away!! Where is the real Jake?! You are doubleganger[1] you- body taker! [It hits Jake who then runs away. BMO, BMO are you home? BMO, we're here to dance with you! [Another bikini babe arrives, she is blue skin with blonde hair.] [When they get no response they listen in with the hands cupped.] [Coming out of the hole and walking up to Finn, he frowns when he sees his signs have been touched.] [When "Jake, what are you implying? That I would touch your signs after being expressly forbidden to do so?". [He shuffles them back and Jake is still frowning.] [Picks up two signs] "Oh dang, the toast?", [he tosses them and walks off.] [Follows him and shows him a sign that states] "Jake rules!", [this gets a smile.] [ [Taps his forehead and expresses that he has an idea.] [Flips a sign] "What?" [Points to his nose.] [Flips a sign with] ??? [Shifts his hand to become bigger and pounds on the wall.] No way fake boys! I am never coming out! [Finn and Jake shrug.] Bikini Babes! They're not Finn and Jake! Get them! [The Bikini Babes spring into action and begin hurling objects at Finn and Jake who take cover behind the overturned table.] Ow, ow! Okay fine! Uncle uncle, please stop pinching me Bikini Babe!. [ Finn? Jake? For real? We were just playing a game, BMO. It all started this morning when Jake made a sign that said- Oh, I don't care. Let's just-a party! Party, party, party! Ooouuuu! [He also dances.] Armen Mirzaian 1977-2013. "Aw c'mon" [ Marceline! Marceline! I'm open, I'm wide open! Marceline, I've got ups! Check out my ups! Uh! Nope! Ha-ha, too slow! Whoa! [Marceline does a slam dunk] Ha-ha! Yeah, alright! Good game, good game! Take 5! [He starts to dribble but the ball bounces away] I'll get us all a bunch of little waters. [Is dribbling the ball] Marceline, why did you ask ancient chumps to play basketball? Yeah! [She sighs deeply.] Well, he's very dear to my heart. I love him. What you are talking about, Marceline? We've been around for a long time, we have a long history together. It's... it's a long story. Lay it on us! Yeah, lay it out, Marcy! Yeah! Lay down, Marceline, go to sleep! Right? What are we talking about? Alright, I suppose it's about time I told someone this story. Huh. Hmmmmmm... [He stops at a deserted mailbox] Ha-ha! Might be something in here, Marceline! [Laughing] E-e-ewww! It's a dead rat! Hey! Yeah, so it is, looks like we've got a cute new traveling buddy. Ewww, noooooooo!! [Giggling a bit] It's kinda cute... [He closes the mailbox chute and continues walking with Marceline.] [Points to a VHS tape on the ground] Hey, check it out, it's a VHS tape. You wanna watch a movie? Yeah! ...Man, this is a boring movie. I like the book much better! [He throws the tape behind him and they both laugh.] You're so silly, Simon! He-he-he, yeah, I suppose so... Huh? What is that? I'm not sure, but it's coming our way. Come on. [They run over to a car.] Marcy, you stay in the car. I'll be right back. Simon! [pulls on his beard] Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! You're not going to put it on, are you? I have to. To protect us. But you're gonna act weird again! Don't worry, I can control it better now. [Cringes] Mmm... It's okay! B.R.B. [He kisses Marcy on the forehead. He pulls his head out of the window. The object rustling in the woods comes closer.] Oh, boy. Here it comes. Oh, bread balls. Oh, bread balls! OH, BREAD BALLS! [puts on his crown. His nose and hair and beard grow., starts laughing maniacally] I call upon the power of ice and snow!! Ice winds, blow!!! [Icy cold wind shoots at a deer which flies out of the bushes and lands perfectly on its feet. It looks around confused.] Rragh! YOU WILL NO LONGER TERRIFY A 47-YEAR-OLD MAN AND A 7-YEAR-OLD GIRL! [Zaps ice at the deer. A ball forms around the deer. It becomes frozen. Marcy gasps. [gets out of the car] Simon, stop! It's frozen! Not now, Gunther, I'm doing big people things. Come play in the snow, build me a snowman. [Sprinkles some snow on Marcy.] Bleh! [Simon continues zapping the deer. The ball becomes frozen with the deer inside it. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-- Huh? [The crown falls off and he suddenly hits the ground on his head. Marcy rushes over.] Simon! Simon, are you okay?! Uh...uh...yeah. You're getting worse, Simon. Your hair and your nose are longer, and you started to hover in the air! Oh, yeah. Did I look pretty...FLY?! [starts to laugh] What are you talking about? You're scaring me. [continues laughing. His hair and nose grow back to normal.] I'm sorry. Did I say something? Simon, promise me you won't put it on again. [looks down] OK. I promise. What is that thing? It's a deer. If there are deers in the forest, do you think there are other things? [eyes widen] I don't know. [cuts to [sings the piano intro to Cheers theme song] [Singing] ♪ Making your way in the world today, takes everything you got. ♪ [looks confused] ♪ Taking a break from all your worries, sure would help a lot. Sometimes you want to go, where everybody knows your name! ♪ What is this? Filmed before a live studio audience. [makes a squeaking noise] Norm! Mute. [laughs and then starts coughing] [looks at Marcy] Marcy...? [puts his hand on Marcy's forehead. He gasps.] Oh, no... Uh, you're fine. Just a bit warm, but you should get some sleep. [Marcy is snoring] Hey! Good morning! I made you breakfast! It's mostly pine needles and deer guts. [lowering his voice] Oh, you're even worse. [Normal voice] I mean, don't freak out or anything, but we need to get you some... chicken soup! [packs up the sleeping bag] There you go. [to Marcy] There must've been a soupery in that town, but I don't want you walking all... [spots a motorcycle] ...that way. [both are on the motorcycle] Okay. You ready for a motorbike ride? Mmm-hmm. Okay, now we're talking. [pants] Just needs a little love-- [loses grip from the motorbike because he goes too fast] AAH! WOWZERS! [tries to catch it as it goes away but it hits a wall] Okay, let's try something else. Hey, Marcy, I wrote a song for you. [sings The Soup Hunting Song] [laughs] Your songs are sooo good. Here we go! [tries to open the door] Aw, it's locked. [throws the chair into the window] Vandalism is wrong, Marcy. Okay. Oh, everything's gone... except for these greeting cards. [looks at the card. It says, "HEY OLD MAN..." He turns the page. "...Have a 'soup-er' 'broth'-day! ('birthday')"] Aw... Simon, look! [points at the security mirror] [gets down then gasps] What is that thing? This-This is bad. No. I have to protect us. No! I have to. No, don't put it on! Marcy, stay back! [knocks mutant out with the crown. He presses on the mutant then green goo comes out] Aah! We're getting out of here! [steps on a remote] Oops. Hey, little lady, what about a ride on an old man's back? I can walk. I'm not a child, Simon. Look, sweetie, someday you'll be too big to hold. I'm as old as garlic balls, and if someone offered to pick me up and carry me, I'd do it in a heartbeat. Take it when you can get it. [Carries Marcy then she sneezes on his face and laughs] Gross. [wipes it away] You're gross. You're gross, Simon. We're both gross, darling. [Gasps then sees something at the top of the bridge, then walks near the bridge] A food truck! Might be chicken soup inside there. [He climbs to the top of the bridge] Alright, now to get some chicken soup inside you--[inside it are clams] Clams? [closes one door of the truck to see what name it is] The Clambulance?! No, I need chicken! Marceline, cover your ears! MOTHER, MOTHER, MOTHER, MOTHER, MOTHER, MOTHER, MOTHER, MOTHER! [starts kicking the door of the truck while saying this, then a mutant appears under the truck and grabs [gasps, then Simon kicks the mutant away then a mutant came out hiding at the Clambulance] [Frightened] Mother, Mother! [ What are we gonna do, Simon? We're gonna run! [runs and jumps to a tree with pink substance; they stick to it] Whoa! Come on, come on, come on!! Mama, mama, mama, mama, mama mia! Our butts are grass, right? Not yet. Don't leave me here Simon! I can fight! I'm sorry Marcy. Simon! You have to keep it together Simon you promised. [ Marcy! Look I-I found chicken soup! Your gonna feel awesome in a moment. I'm just glad [gulp] you're ok. Do you feel awesome? [Marcy nods her head] I love you, Simon. I love you... Gunther. Pretty heavy Whoa, mama Whoa, so what happens next? How does it end? Well, little Marcy felt a lot better. And she and Simon lived happily ever after. [Passes the ball to Ice King and smiles at him] Aww, that's nice. [whispers] Marceline, you keep telling these chump stories while I score a bunch of baskets. [chuckles] Okay. Yeah, yeah! [ Okay, okay, I'm up. [pushes cat away, gets out of bed, and sniffs her shirt deeply] Ah! [smacks lips] Hey, everybody. I've asked you here today because you are the best of the best. Anyway, recent data shows an increased chance of threat to the Candy Kingdom. [Punches his palm] So I'm developing a new defense. [Pulls back curtains, revealing a Gumball Guardian] I've installed sleeping gas in the Gumball Guardians. If any bum tries to attack us, they will be sprayed without mercy. Isn't that nice? The only thing is the gas will spread and knock out anyone who breathes it—anyone but you guys, my trained elite. So watch closely. I'm gonna show you all how to overcome the gas [squints and points to her head] with sheer willpower. [points to Gumball Guardian] Hit it! [waving] Hi! [flying in through the window] Yo, Bubblegum! [closes the curtains] Marceline! You're up late. [quickly] No time for chitchat. Let's hang out—right now. Hmm, I don't know. I'm, uh, kinda busy. [looks at Cinnamon Bun] Uh, [waves] hi. Listen, Bub-Bubs. I tracked down Maja the Sky Witch. Oh, what?! Yeah, I tailed her to an enchanted forest, but it's all jammed up with barrier spells. Ohhh, I think I see where this is going. Well, you love getting out your big brain and... and... I just thought it'd be cool to spend some quality time with you. [sighs] I need your help, okay? But why are you so interested in finding Maja? It's just really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really important to me. Whoa. Okay, but— Come on, I got your pack-pack. [helps her put it on] Um, sure, but— Hold on to that "but," PB. [pulls her out the window] [grunts] Whee! [waving out the window] Haha! Whee. Gah! Something's wrong. Huh? Hey! [pulls at the vines] This stuff—it's like a brick wall! [bites a vine] Let's just blow the whole thing up. [rubs a high-tech thimble on the vines] Hmmm. [inspects thimble] It's a Sleeping Gate Bramble. How do we kill it? All we have to do is take the path of least resistance. [looks around] Alright, so where is it—the path? It's in here [points at her head] and in here [places her hand over her heart]. Now [inhales] take a deep breath [exhales and falls backwards into the vines] and be passive. [falls through to the other side] [lies on the Sleeping Gate Bramble, which does not yield] [inhales] Grrrr! [bangs her head on the bramble] [poking her head through the bramble] Hello, friend. Trouble relaxing? How 'bout a cup of chamomile tea? [gives a red cup of tea to Marceline] [sucks the red from the cup and falls through to the other side where several large mushrooms are growing on the ground] Wow! Wild digs. [holding up a device] Tell me about it. My googoomamameter is going babies. And look at my watch! [shows watch to Marceline] It's... pink. It's running backwards. There's serious witchery afoot here. Come on, Princess. We don't got all night. [walks forward while pulling along Princess Bubblegum by her arm] [sniffs] [A black feather falls in front of her.] [hisses] What are those things? Totem cairns. That's Maja's Crabbit Familiar. Wibba-wha? Marceline! It's me! Hambo! Yeah, girl. What took you so long? I thought you gave up on me. Your teddy bear? I'm sorry, man! [starts walking towards Hambo] [holding her back] Yo, wait a sec! [turns to Princess Bubblegum] WHAT?! Marcy, how old are you? It's a trick, right? Come on! Help me out, dum-dum! [fake crying] Boo-hoo. Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo [taking Princess Bubblegum's hand off of her] Get off! [starts running toward Hambo] Buddy! [tackling Marceline] NO! [on the ground] [grunts] BONNIE! You killed him? Don't be dense! Hambo can't even talk! Snap out of it, girl. He's been with a witch this whole time. Maybe he can talk now. That's seriously what this is about? Rescuing your old teddy bear? Yeah. Sorry I didn't tell you. You might not have come otherwise. Um, yeah. Raggedy Princess can make you a new Hambo in, like, three seconds... or Raggedy Princess can be your new Hambo. She'd do it, too. That girl's got, like, zero self-respect. [chuckles] That's mean—don't tell her I said that. I'm not getting a new Hambo. There's only one Hambo. It's just a doll. [raises her fist] See this? [extends her arm towards Princess Bubblegum and starts moving it in a circle] [imitates a plane's engine] Voooooooo... What's that? You gonna bop me one? It's comin' in for a landing. What'cha gonna do, PB? Wanna keep dissing Hambo? [sighs] [monotone] I'm sorry, Marceline. Let's go get Hambo. [retracts arm] Disengage. We should track that bird-rabbit thing. Right. [squints] Hmm. [sees broken branches] Bang. [points] There goes some broken branches. It left a trail. I see it. [flies away] [running after her] Hey! Hold on now! [pants] This bag's mad heavy! [flying through branches and shielding her face with her arms] [grunts] Glommit! [jumps over a mushroom] [grunts] [comes to a clearing] MARCELINE! [walking up to a pond] I thought you needed my help. [looks into pond and sees the reflection of a house] Huh. [looks up and sees only clouds.] Nice trick, Maja. [at pond] You in there, Marceline? Hyup! [dives into pond] [gasps for air as she falls up toward a house in the sky] WHOAAAA! [grabs doorknob to house, opens door, and walks into the foyer] Woof. [The door closes and locks behind her.] [looks around] Okay, PB, use your brain. Where would this witch keep Hambo? Break it down. [squints and her vision turns red as she looks at details around the house] Micro... and macro... the picture... becomes... clear... and... call it! [points to each detail she saw] Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, wait... [points to opening above chandelier] yes. [climbs up the chandelier's chain] Where are you, Maja, you creep? [bumps her head on the ceiling] Oof. [sees a small door] What? [opens door, revealing Hambo] Hambo! [Hambo falls back and starts transforming into Crabbit.] No! Caw, caw! You again. I'LL KILL YOU! Give me Ham—[Crabbit slams the door in her face.] Uh! [opens door and follows Crabbit back to the foyer, where they start fighting] Jeez, man. This must be all of her stolen junk. Ugh, what a creep. [lifts a toy car] Psh, a Ford Broncus. [sets it down] Hmm... [looks around] Whoa! [sees a box and reads its label] "My Privates"? Come here, biddy. [climbs up junk to it] Bam. Whoops! [falls backwards, pulling the box with her and spilling papers] What the—? [picks up a paper] Invoices? [looks at another one] Receipts? [reads it] "Zumma zoom bleep blop for the purchase of Hambo." Whoa, WHAT?! That's my private box. So you purchased Hambo? From some weenus named Ash? That's right. He was a weenus so I wrote it on there as my personal joke. [pulls out Hambo from under her poncho] But the sale is still legit. Hambo's mine! His body's all juice-logged with sentimental affection—a savory spell spice. So get out of my face, alright? Where's Marceline? She's busy with my Crabbit... crow-bit... crow-rabbit. I knew that tranch wouldn't respect my proof of purchase. So what about you, bozo? By the laws of my kingdom, I must honor the exchange of goods for legal tender. But guess what—I'm not leaving without Hambo. [laughs] So what are you gonna do about it? [makes a fist and pulls up her sleeve] I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. Marceline! [throws Hambo to her] Yoink! [catches it] Hambo! [shedding tears] Oh, it's me, buddy! [wipes her tears] [hugs it and sighs] How did you—? I took care of it. [jumps from the staircase onto Crabbit] Let's bust out. [grunts] They got away with your [grunts] Hambo. Huh-duh! I let them! You what? I made a trade... for this! [pulls out Princess Bubblegum's t-shirt] Bing! [puts it on her face] Mmmmm. [sniffs] Sentimental freshness! Ah, the psychic resonance on Hambo is nothing [rips off a sleeve] compared to this baby! [tosses sleeve into cauldron, which flares up violently] WHOO! Hahahaha! Listen, Maja. I am not your familiar anymore. I wanna be a dancer. That's cool. Then why don't you dance to this?! [zaps Crabbit with lightning] AAAH! Nice moves! [zaps] Now you're the weenus! [Crabbit leaves] Hey, don't go! [flies after him and continues zapping] Ahahahahaha! I'm cookin' up something big, Crabbit! This is my victory lap! Ahahahahaha! Heck yeah! We’re home. That was definitely the longest adventure we’ve ever done. What about when you got trapped in a mind dungeon for a buncha years? This trip was longer in emotional time. Yeah, I’m burnt out. No more adventure for a while, okay? Yes, yes, yes! Let’s go take hot showers! Hey, look at this fish. It’s… gummy? Hello! Hey! Well, that’s weird. We should defs check it out after we hit up the tree house. Yeah. We gotta get to the bottom of this hot shower. Hmm. Does everything seem pinker to you? Home always looks different after a long trip. You’re seeing it with fresh eyes and newfound wisdom. And sometimes there’s also a new strip mall or something. So, everything being pink is probably not a big deal, and also, I’m tired. I like the pink. Why you worry so much, worry baby? Haha, yeah, why you worry so much, worry baby? Don’t worry, Finn. We are only teasing you because you are a baby. Woah! What the heck happened to the tree house? Candy… Fern? Oh, I do not like this. Is this some kind of sick joke? Because I love it. Huh? Big Baby Root Beer? No one buys this brand. It’s too sweet. Hello? Ah! Hey! You look like me. Fern? Who’s And I’m Nectr, the little robot! And I’m Welcome, strangers! It’s so cool that you’re inside our house. Dude, when did you guys turn into candy? We’ve always been candy, you silly billy bean! Oh, okay, I get it. We’ve obviously stumbled into another alternate dimension where everyone’s a different version of themselves. Yawn. But we haven’t gone through any portals. Hello! Neptr is so cute now! I’m going to start treating him as an equal. You were supposed to take care of Ooo while I was gone. What happened with that? What? You used to be this volatile plant boy, remember? Really? Well, I’m candy now. And, I’m in control of my emotions. I’m in control, too. Of my body! Wow, gummy Shelby’s a lot of fun. I think I’m okay with candy world. No way. Let’s talk to P.B. I’m sure this is all one of her experiments gone wrong. You seem upset, friend. The tower will fix you right up. The what, now? Oh, boy! Let’s run outside! Hello, it’s me! Lemonpink! He was inside the lemon. Drink up, babies! Squeeze! I used to have a lot of fear and sadness, but now I’m fine! Hey, I want some of that! No. That is body juice. Hmm? What’s that? Did you spurn my fluids? No…? Maybe someone’s feeling a little sour! Wuh-woah! You know what sours get! Sours get the tower! Sours get the tower! Sours get the tower! Sours get the tower! Sours get the tower! Come on, Jake. Let’s go see Bubblegum. Stop striding! It just keeps you agitated. I’m freaking out, Jake. This place is weird. What I’m hearing is, you’re stressed out because everything’s candy. Aren’t you? Not really. Lemongrab’s always been a weirdo. At least now he’s helping people. And Fern is, like, laughing and joking around. Maybe they don’t need you to fix them. Hmm. I always believe you when you use that voice. Sweet P.? Hey, buddy. What are you doing out- -Hey! You’re meat! Yes, I’m meat. But everything else is weird. Wow, Sweet P., that’s almost exactly what I’ve been saying. Sweet P., do you remember what happened? One day, the candy came and turned mommy and daddy into something… different. Sweet P.! We’ve been looking for you everywhere! We just love you so much, son. You’re gonna get into a great college! They look so happy, like dogs. Don’t worry, Sweet P. We’re headed to the candy kingdom to see Princess Bubblegum about all this. She’s not in the candy kingdom. She’s in the terrible tower. Look! Come on, Jake, that’s kind of weird, right? I think it’s magnificent! Sweet P.! Yoo hoo! We brought some rollers and a bucket of sweet juicy caramel. Let’s get you back to normal. But mama, I am normal! Just sit tight there like a windowpane, and you’ll be back to normal like a windowpane. Back to normal. Hmm. Okay, you’re right. This is pretty freaky-deaky. I’m gonna go now. Sweet P., come back! Uh… Let’s get to the tower. And never be the guy with no phone, Finn. You’ll think it’ll make people wanna talk to you more, but people just forget to invite you to things. You’ve convinced me. Plus, I like late night bedtime calls when you’re sleeping over at Lady’s. Ooh. Something smells nice. Nice and toasty. S’more! Stay back, s’more! Get it, get it, get it, get it! Woah, dudes. I was just playin’. What? Marceline? No, it’s Marshmaline, the Campfire Queen. Would you like to hear a song? I’ve written just the ditty that’ll cheer up anyone that’s overwhelmed with work or responsibility. Yay! I love Marshmaline songs! No time for tunes. Do you know where Bonnie is? Of course! Follow me. Marshy… Where’s P.B.? She’s everywhere! Good tidings to you, my friends. Yahoo! What… What happened to you? Oh, this? I’ve become what I was always meant to become A pure candy elemental. ‘Scuse me. What about Tree Trunks, and Lemongrab, and Marceline, and everyone else? I fixed ‘em, obviously. “Fixed ‘em?” But they’re your friends! Those aren’t mutually exclusive concepts. That means it’s fine. No. It’s not fine! Don’t fret. I can fix you too. I can feel my bones turning gummy! Me, too! We gotta get out of here before- Hugs! I’m connected to all candy throughout all the galaxies. Once you’re candy, you’ll be part of me too! No! That plan sucks. Oh, my gosh! Ah! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! Skyhooks! Ice King? Hold on to me, bro! No! Wait, we forgot BMO! Goodbye, boys! It’s better this way! Oh, well. They’ll be back. They have nowhere else to go. Are we in… Cloud Kingdom. Looks like we got away before the candy curse became permanent. That’s right. My skyhooks saved the day. Thanks for getting us out of there, Simon. Aw, I can’t take all the credit. It’s all thanks to my skyhooks! Hey, why are you even up here? We live here, now. Me and the skyhooks. Finn...You gotta see this. Oh...my... ...butt. Skyhooks! BMO, turn the music down. BMO! Turn it down! [Increases volume.] [Groans] Come on, BMO you're messing up my game! [Continues dancing] Hey, dude, can I borrow that paper? Mm-hmm. [Whistles; rolls up paper; hits BMO with it] Bad computer! No! No! [Music stops.] Now go sit in the corner and think about your life. [Roars] Snail attack! Aaaaaah! Oof! [Crying and squirting fluids on Finn & Jake who are both coughing and gagging] Oh, sick! Ugh! Dude, how do you fight a snail?! Hold on! [Stretches his arm and grabs a saltshaker] I got this! [Grunts, brandishes saltshaker] Don't make me use this, man! Salt?! But I heard you guys were heroes. We are heroes. We thought you were trying to attack us. Why'd you break in here all mad, squirting that juice all over us? It's not mad juice. It's sad juice. My name's Stop squirting slime! Just tell us what's wrong! I need a girlfriend. I have no one to love. Jake, hero huddle. [They huddle] What do you think? I think our house is all jacked up. Yeah, but he's just an innocent goober looking for love. Yeah. Okay, let's help him. But he's got to lay off the house. Right! All right, man. We'll help you hook up as long as you— Yay! Whoa! Aaah! Lay off the house, man! [Sadly] You guys... won't help me? [Whimpers] All right! all right! We'll help you, dude! Just put our house back! Okay! Right after I get a girlfriend. Aw! All right, you big crazy. It's a deal. [Giggles] Jake, what time is it?! I don't know, but you're probably going to say... Lady time! [LADY TIME screen card; Wolf whistle] Okay, Snorlock, if you want a lady, you have to be yourself. How do I be myself? Uh, how does he be himself, Jake? Just do whatever you want, man, as long as it comes from the inside. Like sad juice? No! You keep that stuff inside you, brother. You just got to talk to 'em. Oh. I never done that. Finn, you see any hot mamas? [Looks through telescope] Ummm... Baaaaaam! Go talk to her! Uhmm... Go talk to her! [Sighs] Okay. Oh! [See's Snorlock and inhales gut] Hello. Hi. Mm. You seem like a reasonable male. We should go to a movie sometime. He's got this. Yeah. [Getting nervous] Uhh... I like old movies. [Chuckles] Uh..uh uh... Um, are you okay? [Screaming] Aaaaaaaaah! Girlfriend! Girlfriend! Aaah! Girlfriend! Girlfriend! Girlfriend! Girlfriend! Girlfriend! Girlfriend! Dude! our house! We got to do something! Relax. I got it. Snorlock! Hey, Snorlock. You okay, buddy? Went a little nuts there, guy. You got to get that under control, 'cause you're scaring ladies and jacking up our house. I'm sorry. Are you gonna leave me? Aw, who could leave you? Come here, you big hot mess. [Hugs] Break it up, you two! We have ladies to attend to! Yeah, the ladies. Talking to ladies is hard. No, it's not. Check it out, Snorlock. Finn, you be the guy snail, and I'll be... [Shifts to appear like a lady snail] the chick snail. Ugh! gross, Jake! Come on, man. We're just pretending. Do it for love. [Whimpering] Okay. I'll do it for this guy. [Gasps happily] [Clears throat] What's up, lady snail? [High-pitched voice] Well, I'm just sitting here thinking about mating with snails. No! I can't do this, man! I-am-out! I'll mate with you. [Normal voice] We're just role-playing, buddy. Aww. Here, Finn. This time you be the chick and I'll be the snail dude. [Shifts into Guy Snail; flexes pecs] Hey, baby. What's up? Uh... WHA! Mm-mmm! [Sniffs Finn's hand] mm-mmm! [Deep voice] Girl, you smell good. Did you take a bath in rainbows and cupcakes? [Growing more uneasy] Say "yes"! [High-pitched voice] Say "Yes"! [Deep voice] Say "YES"! [High-pitched voice] Say "Yes"! Okay! Yes! [Normal voice] See, Snorlock? Talking to ladies is easy. Just act like me. Uh... girl, you smell good. You can smell me? May I smell you more? Uh, okay. [Sniffs] Cupcakes... Uh, I have to go. Did you take a bath? Don't ever talk to me again. Please don't go! Don't go! Aww. Aw, it's okay, buddy. Come here and give us a hug. Man, I wish you guys were ladies. Uhh. Stay focused, Snorlock. You have any cool talents that ladies might like? No. Umm, hey, Finn, teach him how to use swords. The princesses always love this one. [Preforms stabbing motions and flips] Yah! yah! yah! yah! Yaaaah! hyah! Do you think you can do that, Snorlock? I don't know. Hmm. Maybe you're musical. Can you do this? [Inhales deeply, begins beatboxing] Try doin' all that. Hmm. [Grunts, grows arms, grabs the swords then begins beatboxing and twirling swords] Whoo-hoo! yeah! My word, Eleanor! What is that alluring sound? I have no idea. Yeah, Snorlock! Show us that talent! Whoo-hoo! Oh, my! What is that? What is that wonderful sound? Do I see swords? Jake, these chicks look pretty serious. Let's just let Snorlock do his thing. Go to it, buddy! [Grabs Finn and sits on top of observatory boat] [Snorlock beatboxing continues] Ahh! Ooh! Ahh. Look at him go! Bringing in the ladies. Uh, he's bringing in a lot of ladies. [Crowding around Snorlock and begin grinding on him] Mm! [Both screaming] Snorlock! These ladies are ruining our tree house! Stop! Whoa! Wedge, dude! [Grunting] [Sticks sword into house's top to pull it off Snorlock] [Grunting] It's no use, man. It's stuck with snail slime. [Gets shoved back and forth between the Snail Ladies] Finn! Aah! [Also gets shoved back and forth between the Snail Ladies] How are we gonna get our house back? [ Wha? Jake! No! You'll get slimed or grinded on! [Runs and then jumps into the house window] Hmph! [Gasps as he sees what Jake has] [Nods] Snorlock, I'm gonna give you till the count of three, mister! One, two, three! Fine. I didn't want to have to do this. [Taps out a single grain of salt onto his palm] [Inhales deeply and then blows it in Snorlock's direction] Aaaaaah! [Bucks the house off his back] Ow! ow! Owwwwwww! Oh, my gosh! He's naked! [Laughter] What? I'm naked? But I've never had a shell. Snorlock, you never had a shell? That means you're not naked. You're a slug! Me, a slug? Yeah, man. That's why you have trouble with snail chicks. You need slug chicks. [Pouting] I don't known any slug chicks. Actually, I-I'm not really a snail. I'm a slug. My shell's made of peppermint. [Laughs happily] That's gross! I don't know why they have to make out so close to our house. I don't know. Come on, let's finish rebuilding it. I got some ear plugs you can borrow. Where's that music coming from? [Watching the two slugs] Go! go! go! go! BMO! Get over here and help us rebuild the tree house. Yeah. You live here, too! [Increases volume] Oh, BMO! Yeah, you think you're pretty way up there but I can get you! [he stretches to be on Lady's level.] 나 잡아봐봐~ ("Catch me if you can.") Alright. Let me just add three more drops of explosive diarrhea. Oooo... Hey Princess Bubblegum, when we bring the dead back to life, will it be filled with worms? No. If my decorpsinator serum works, all the dead Candy People will look as young and healthy as you do. Pick up that platter, tough guy. Old Mr. Cream Puff? [Giggles] We used to date. [Applies the serum.] Something's happening! Come on, come on... Work. Algebraic! Wait, something's wrong. Sugar! [Squirts serum out of his eyes and mouth] Ew! Hey, look, the decorpsinator serum is working! No, this is wrong. They're not coming back to life--they're still dead! The decorpsinator serum--it's incomplete! [she rubs the head of a candy person that looks like a love heart.] [lashing out at Princess Bubblegum] Rah. Must eat sugar! [Pushes him back down] You're grounded, Mister. Oh, this is really bad. They're going to be attracted to the Candy Kingdom! Why? Because the Candy People are made of sugar, ya ding dong! [On Princess Bubblegum] Gimme some sugar, baby. Chew on this! [Kicks him] [Giggles] Good one, Finn. Quickly, to the kingdom! [Kicks another zombie] Get a life! All citizens of the Candy Kingdom! Report to the palace, immediately! Whoa! [worried] Hurry, sweet citizens. Alright, you heard the princess, everyone in! Alright, no pushing, come on! Dude, what's up? The princess will explain everything. Tree Trunks, get those hot buns in here, girl. [Carrying hot cross buns] Oh, I hope it's not bad news. Did we get everyone? All present and accounted for. Thanks, Manfried. You're welcome. Citizens, we are assembled here in the candy foyer for a momentous announcement. Tonight we are all going to have... a slumber party! What?! Wait! What about the zom--?! [Princess Bubblegum covers his mouth] Go ahead and start partying. [Voice muffled] But, Princess, the Undead-- [Carries Finn to the lab] We'll be right back, everyone. Whooo! Finn, the Candy People can't know about the zombies. Wha?! If they knew, they would flip out. What do you mean "flip out"? I mean they would flip out. Princess? It's me, He explodes in a flash of light. Back at the castle.] Candy People explode when they get scared?! Not telling the Candy People about the zombies is so important that you need to promise, Royal Promise, not to let anyone find out about the zombies, ever. Okay, sure. No, Finn. You have to Royal Promise. Yes, [kneels] I Royal Promise. Now I must cloister myself in the lab and finish the equation to my decorpsinator serum. You keep the candy folk distracted and ignorant. Can you do that? Yes, your highness. Good. Don't tell anyone about the zombies. Never ever. [She leaves] No, wait. Can I at least tell [Jake enters] Jake? Tell me about what, dude? You know, about the outbreak of zom-- [Covers his mouth] [Chuckles] Alright, what's going on? Uhh, nothing at all, buddy! [Laughs awkwardly and skips into the foyer] Hey, dude. I think you and Bubblegum are up to something. [nervously] Ahha ah, what? No, no way. Whoa, you guys are up to something. Is it some sort of prank? Can I get in on it? [To party-goers] Who wants to play "Truth or Dare"? Hmm... Ok, Chocoberry, you may ask someone to tell a deep truth or a saucy dare. Mr. Cupcake, truth or dare? Dare. I dare you to take off your wrapper. [Shoulders Finn] Hey seriously, man. I'm your bro. Bros are supposed to tell bros everything all the time. What are you and Bubblegum up to? Is everything alright? Yep! Fine! Everything is great! Heh, heh. [Crinkling sound] Except for that. Whoa. I didn't know he was chocolate. Jake, truth or dare? Truth. Do you prefer chocolate or fudge? I can't eat chocolate or fudge 'cause I'm a dog and they'd probably kill me, but hmmmmm probably... neither. Finn! Truth or dare? Dare! Haha! I dare you... to tell me the truth about what's going on in your mind. What were you and Bubblegum talking about when you were alone together? [Nervously] Umm, ahh, the truth is, ahhh... You promised you wouldn't freakin' tell anyone! Oh, you're so cute, Finn. Ahhh... the truth is... that I'd rather play Dodge Socks! I'm not playing dodge socks 'til you stop dodging my questions. Hey... [Sniffs socks] Old Mr. Cream Puff? Isn't he dead? Hey, give me my sock back! Dodge Socks was a bad idea! Whoa. [angrily] Look dude, just tell me what's up, 'cause you are crazier than a cannonball tonight. [Thinking] Oh, my goodness! Princess hasn't finished the equation and the zombies are here! I, uh, she just want this slumber party to be super fun, and if I did have something to tell you, then I would in a second, and it would make my life easier, unless there was something stopping me, like a promise, but there isn't, so I won't, so it's cool. Sugar! What? You lost me. Umm... Hey, you know what time it is? Adventure time? No, time for Seven Minutes in Heaven! You're first. Really? Lady Rainicorn! In the closet with Jake! 뭐? 나? 웃겨 정말. 그래, 좋아. 하자. ("What? Me? You gotta be kidding me. Okay, then. I'll play.") Okay, okay, alright. [Closet door closes on I can't hear you all the way in heaven! Umm, does anyone else hear that? What? Hear what? I, I don't hear anything. I hear something I don't understand... and it makes me scared! [Begins to shake.] What? No, Chet. Everybody, wait. What noise? You mean this noise? [Turns on a radio and party lights comes on.] Oh. [Laughs] Yeah! Dance it! Bust it up! Uh! Uh! Uh! Oh! What is this game you are playing at now, Finn? Uhh, it's... Blockado. Haha, the game of barricades. Come on, let's block all the entrances and windows! Alright, this is not a permanent solution. Think Find out about what, Finn? Manfried, the talking piñata! Your convenient appearance gives me a great idea. Everyone, grab a stick! New game! We're gonna smash some piñatas! What? Except for you, Manfried. Oh, thank goodness. Now everybody don these blindfolds. [Whispering] Thanks, Taffy Girl. Alright, everybody, get together. I'm hanging the piñatas... [The zombies burst through the barricades] They're all around you. Smash the piñatas! Yeah! You guys are on fire! Oh, it is so tasty. Yes! We did it! My improbable plan worked! Whew! 안녕! ("Hello!") Seven minutes up yet? [Grabs a jelly filled doughnut and eats it, noticing the zombie corpses.] Whoa! [Runs to Finn] What the nuts happened here?! Oh, we killed all the zombies that Princess Bubblegum and I raised from the dead. Really!? Jake? What's going on? What? Huh? Oh, Finn! Did you break your Royal Promise? Yeah, but, I mean, all the zombies are dead. The Candy People won't freak out. What's the big deal? This is really, really bad, Finn. You can't break Royal Promises. Never, ever, never. No matter what, forever. The Guardians of the Royal Promise are coming for us. Whoa! Finn the Human. You have broken a Royal Promise for which the penalty is trial by fire. That's stupid. Wait! He's my friend! Isn't there another option?! Yes. Because you care for the promise-breaker, we will give him a less hot trial. You must now answer... ...Math questions! Mathematical! Finn, you're terrible at math. Awww. Now, solve this! [Puts Finn in front of Guardian 2, who puts up a hologram of an overly complicated math equation] Uhh.... Oh, wait, wait, I thought of a better one. [Replaces the equation with one that says "2+2"] Yes! Two plus two. Solve it or die. Uhh. Four, right? Oh, correct. What's happening, Princess? You've defeated the broken royal promise! The Gumball Guardians are resetting! Slamacow! That was tops! Who's not good at math? I was all "Four!" Four, four... Four, four, four... That's it! The answer was so simple, I was too smart to see it! You're welcome! '4' is the last figure I need to perfect my decorpsinator serum. Golly! Woohoo! Yeah! This is messed up, but sweet. 진짜로. ("Truly it is.") Uncle Chewy! Grandma! Former dead relative! Starchie! Mornin'. [Walks over to Finn] Man, you broke a Royal Promise? You're nuts. All you had to do is say that it was a royal secret. I know what's up. [Walks away from Finn.] I hope you grasp the full consequences of breaking promises. Heck yeah! If I break a Royal Promise, I get to fight zombies, throw slumber parties, awake Gumball Guardians and... and... Alright, alright. [evilly] And reverse death itself! Oh, you are adorable. But keep your promises, okay? I will, Princess. Starchie, you're not a zombie. I can't help it. Flesh is delicious! You're delicious! Don't squeeze me! I'll fart! Princess, he did it! Root Beer Guy set up the force field! But he sacrificed himself to do it. It's an ugly scene, man. Let me see. [takes binoculars] Rest in peace, Root Beer Guy. Give up now, Princess, and I, I make no such promise. Oh, Glob! Oh, oh, oh! Oh, well. [laughs] What can you do? Crunchy, chill. Chill. Keepers of the clock, masters of dimension, bear witness! By my power, I compel you to converge! Past and present, be one. Awaken the terror of a forgotten age in this moment that is all moments in the blink of an eye. Darren, the ancient sleeper, arise! I had a dream I was fighting an army that could birth new soldiers from their own blood. I was endless. Does that make sense? Yes. You want to go conquer the Candy Kingdom? What's that? It's a place that contains the highest levels of caring and sentimental affection in all of Ooo. What is caring? What kind of world is this? It's a feeling I use in my magic to give me power. Like this shirt that was once the prized possession of Princess Bubblegum. With the feelings in this shirt, I was able to summon you. I don't—walk me through this. All right. This kingdom of candy... Yes? I will lay it to waste, turn their people to salt. Yeah... And garnish a million meals with the salt, which we will eat for eternity. That's not my plan exactly, but you'll be fine. I promise. I promise, as well, to deliver destruction so thorough that all realities are affected. Okay. We'll talk about that. All realities. Hey! We'll talk about it! Break this witch out, Darren. How long will your force field hold, Gridface Princess? The sleeper's magic is older than legend. I don't know how he disabled both Gumball Guardians, but at least I know my tech is tight. The field will hold long enough for you to think of a weak plan. [on phone] Colonel Candy Corn? Uh, yes, Princess. Ready the cannons. You got me? If they get through that barrier, I don't want to have to use our ground troops. Will do, Princess. And let me just say... thank you for putting this old crease back in the field. I haven't been the same since my lovely Linda passed away. Yeah. Good luck. Oh, I tried dating again, you know? But these young girls think I'm too serious or something. Why don't you date someone your own age? [covers receiver] Peppermint Butler, come on! Oh, women my age don't hang out. Where are they hiding? I need a young girl with an old soul to heal my heart. This is taking too long. Then do the thing! I call forth the Legion of Cadmus, the Dragon's Teeth! What am I supposed to—oh! Party's starting. Load 'em up, soldiers! Yeah, just put it in there. I don't know. Oh, dang! Fire! Finn and Jake, are you ready to—what the...? Finn? [to a Banana Guard] Where the jam is Finn?! I don't know. Weren't they just here? What the jam?! All right. Finn or no Finn, PB's got to get in that biz. [mounts Swan] Hyah! [takes off] Why have you stopped firing? We ran out of ammo, colonel. That's nonsense, soldier. This is how you defend your kingdom! Fire, you wimps! [The cannon fires.] Ya-ha! Ah! [laughs] For the kingdom! For the king... Oh, zang! [dodges blast] ...ingdom! [exhales sharply] Eat it, tranch! It's over, Princess. Prepare to be annihilated across all dimensions. Princess! No! Wait, Darren! Dial it back. I need her residual feelings. What the flip is feelings? Wah! What the slizz?! Yeah, boy! Hi, Darren. The Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant?! Eli, were you asleep forever too? All this stuff is different now. What are we even doing here? Yes, it's been a difficult adjustment. Blaze his face, Eli! Yes, master. [shoots laser] Yo! Leave me out of it! No! [charges up an attack] Yeah, right. [laughs] Finn, his weakness is his brain seed. Okay! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Oh, uh! [grunts] Aah! [stabs brain] Thank you. Whoa! [cheer] [squawks] Well, I guess my kids still have a daddy. [kicks Darren's body] Bam, you dope! Party tonight in the Candy Kingdom! Hey, where's Finn? Hi. Okay. Y'all bring food and bevs. Finn, you make the guac, all right? I'll make the guaaaaaaaaaaac. Finn! Finn! Yo! What's up, APTWE? What do I do now? Dude, I don't know. Probably not go back in the basement. You're so big'uns. You should be free, boy. Free to do what? I need psychic commands. Can you help me dice tomatoes for this guac? No. You see, man, I feel weird giving you orders. You should just do your own thing. Realize your potential. But this is what I am—a war machine who serves its master. No, man. You're more than that. [drops guacamole] Whoops. I see into your brain, remember? You'll do great. Just go for it. I believe in you, man. Oh, word. Thanks. Maybe Darren was right. There's no place for my ancient ways. [flies off] Don't think like that, dude! Come back and see us whenevs! I'm doing this for a reason. What choice is there? Hungry! Hungry! Hungry! Must feed babies. [feeds worms to chicks] Hey! Elephant. I'm more ancient than you. Someday, I will engulf the solar system. What was and what will be are meaningless. Meanwhile, you should wonder are you just a two-headed pile of meat on a crash course with the cosmic dump? Or do you contain the soul memory of a million dead stars? How do you light a candle without a match? Hello? Who's that? Why can't I see jack? You bonked your head. You're in a coma, but I can help. Um, all right. Are you, like, powerful? Yes. I can fly and do lasers from my nose. Okay. I can run with this. Take me to the Candy Kingdom and shoot your laser nose at it. No. I must decide, in this moment, what is best. For now, I am the match and the candle. What? I will be your friend and keep you alive, until you regain consciousness, maybe. Ugh, that plan sounds like dirt! See through my eyes, Maja. Ah! It's bright! Wait! You're the flippin' elephant! You laser-nosed me! Somebody help! Oh, my Glob. Somebody! Well, this wasn't part of my plan. Hey, man. I'm gonna eat you.

I've never heard of Rap Fest Aid. It sure sounds like the big time. But before I can book you anywhere, I'm gonna have to have you sign some waivers and release forms. Boilerplate stuff. Don't bother reading it. [Cheerfully] Okay. [She signs the papers.] [Chuckling] Okay! I'll get this paperwork processed, and we'll be in business.

I couldn't keep up. You got beat by your own son? Are his rap powers that much greater than yours? Yes. Why are you asking about my son?

I've totally gotten over being in lantern jail, so we're good. Well, I was kind of hoping you could acknowledge hurting me, like- Phoebes, come on.

[He pulls off his cloak, revealing who he really is and turns the Stag into a telescope] MAGIC! You're welcome. [He tries to get a good focus on the "star"] Hm... oh... there... wait! [He realizes it is Grob Gob Glob Grod] Oh, Glob. He's here somewhere, my brothers. Glob, can you see Magic Man on the sensor? Yes, Gob. Our little brother is very close. Hey, flip me! Okay. [ I'm gonna activate the thingy that drains his magic juice. [Activates the device] [Groans] My juice! [Wiggling fingers] Not... flowing... right...! Dream on, honey! You can't catch this! [He starts running then jumps into the air doing a continuous somersault] Magic, away! [Disappears momentarily ("Pshewww!") then reappears falling to the ground] Whoops! I think I see him. Yes, I see him as well. Hey, guys? What, Glob? ...Nothing, never mind. Wait, wait! [Stops] Shh, shh, shh! Shush! I wasn't... You hear that? [Long beat] It was totally silent for, like, a whole second! Huh. Oh, yeah! Cool. Sometimes, we get so wrapped up battling stuff, we forget the...Ooomph! [Groans] [Noticing Grob Gob Glob Grod] Aah! [Noticing Jake] Ooh! Waaa-zoo! [Turns Jake into a copy of himself as Finn awakens, then turns into Jake himself] Hey... Shhh. [Throws rock to knock out Finn, then he pretends to be asleep next to Finn] Arise. [Raises Jake, who is a copy of Magic Man] Magic Man. You caused nothing but turmoil and chaos to us on Mars. We hoped banishing you to this world would help you see alike to our Utopian supersociety. Now, tell us, what have you learned in these past two hundred years? Are you guys talking to me? You know you made life on Mars a nightmare! Now we must return you to Mars, where vengeance awaits thee. That's not- Magic Man! Get UP! Did it work? Is he gone? [backflips] Hee-yup-hoop! They took my friend to Mars! Fly me there and help me save him! [rather sarcastically] Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't. See? [wiggles fingers] The transfer drained me. I can probably barely float. [floats] So, I just gotta wait till they kill your friend! See ya! [runs away laughing stupidly] What do you mean, KILL? They're gonna put him on trial for my crimes! Ain't nobody gonna pardon these crimes on my head. Not even the King of Mars! And once he's dead, my magic juice will return to my body. Flowing through me like moonlight through the ghost dance. SQUEEZE!!!! I wish I could help. Except I don't! You succubutt! [singing] C'mon, let's go to my house. C'MON, LET'S GO TO MY HOUSE!! [flies Finn through the air, straining] How long have you had this house? Yes, that is true! Well, I bet there's something in here that could help me save Jake. There is, but you'll never make it work. What?! Where is it? I don't know! Have you seen my trash palace? [peels wallpaper] Yeah, what's the deal? This place is wrecked. Eeeew, ew! What am I stepping in?? That's where I blow my nose all day! Ugh! Yes, welcome to my tower of light! Everyone is welcome to share this magic kingdom. Squirrels, black mold, worms, poison ivy... tiny manticore! [in bottle] Help me, you coward! Magic Man, what is your deal for real? You tell me. Well, for one, I think this house is a reflection of your sick brain. [takes a photo of Magic Man with an unknown woman off the wall] Look at this. Yuk. Who's this you're standing with in this picture? [singing] Memories drift in and out of my mind... ...all right. [tosses picture] Well, I'm gonna keep digging through this stuff til It's downstairs. What? My special thing. [jumps over to wall and puts his hand in a crack and moves it around, hurting his hand] Whoa! Aaaaagh! Holy crepes. Aah! [wall opens] Tada! C'mon. [They exit through the open wall] That's the thing. My special thing. [points to odd machine] A Martian transporter. This can take me to Mars?! Yeah. My brothers gave it to me when they banished me to earth. They thought I'd learn love and use it to go back home. How does it work? You put your hands on those thingies and think stuff about people. [Finn does so] But it's broken! Hasn't worked in 200 years. But... It has to work. It has to. [closes eyes] For Jake. [transporter lights up and starts working] Huzzah?? YAAAH! [is rocketed through the roof into outer space] WHOOOOOOAAA!!! [arrives on Mars, sees a huge dome with Grob Gob Glob Grod, Jake, and Abe Lincoln in it.] Citizens of Mars, King of Mars... [Abe Lincoln raises his hand] Today the most notorious fiend in Martian history stands before us—Magic Man. [reaches the dome and looks in] Stop! [climbs up the side] Turn on the dark. [it grows darker and they project a blank screen on the wall] Okay, so we don't have footage of these crimes. But Grod's pretty good at drawing, so...[Grob draws and Thanks bro. To the plague of the oneness. As we gathered to hold hands and sing our community song, Magic Man cast an evil spell that made our arms grow together. Much suffering ensued. And what about that one time when he turned all the water into hair, and we all got so thirsty we drank it? And when we drank it, we went bald! Many of us did not recover and to this day, hide our losses behind groovy headgear. [touches his headgear] Dark off please. [it grows light again] Magic Man, it bums me out to see this. I remember when you were really cool, before that night you spent on Olympus Mons with Margles. [reaches the top of the building] Aw, man. [taps the dome] Force field. What happened, Magic? Why did you go crazy? If you had just learned to care about living things again, you could have come back whenever you wanted! [as Magic Man] Well, you guys are missing some important details. I'm You sad Magic Man. Instead, you bummed around Ooo, acting like a jerk for 200 years. Yeah, that's true, except I'm not Magic Man! Now! Ready the Wand of Disbursement! Ready. Space Dome, open! Oh snap. [falls off] Magic Man, I give you two choices. One is total annihilation. The wand will touch you, and your soul will meet with Death. The second is to use the power of the wand to convert your body to living stardust, where your consciousness will be jettisoned into the infinite cosmos, on an endless journey of wonder and DISCOVERYYYYYY!!!!! Whoa. That second one sounds pretty cool. I mean, yeah. I'm way into that. Except...oh...I would really miss my best friend. His name is Finn, and I think it would mess him up if I wasn't around. Wait. Did you say you would miss someone? Yeah. And that someone would miss you? Yeah that's ME, you dishrags! [he comes running and throws a chair at Grob Gob Glob Grod, hitting him and making him drop the wand, which accidently touches Jake, who screams in pain as he dies and turns back into himself. The scene cuts to Magic Man who is also back to normal, powers and all.] I win again, just like always! [runs to Jake's body and picks it up] Jakey! No! [gasps] Look! It's the dog! The one you were prophesied to meet! I don't care none for that mess. This wouldn't have globbed if you'd just...listened to my bro! You bunked up, King of Mars! The wisest, most honest super being of all time just put an innocent dog to deads! You're right, Finn the Human. My judgement was less than the standard by which I judge my peers. Of which I have none. I will retrieve your friend from the 37th Dead World. [puts his hands to his head and yells, transporting his mind into the 37th Dead World. He is now walking across a desolate landscape with Jake's body in his arms. He comes across Death.] Death. King of Mars. What's your business? I need this one back. [hold out Jake's body] What will you give me for him? [laughs] Not this time, your majesty. In that case, I offer my immortality. Deal. [ [in real world] [moans] Huh? Hey, I'm alive! Yay! King of Mars saved you! Yes, but at what cost? Oh, man. Should we go get Magic Man? No. I lost a friend. I cannot lose my brother, as well. Hey! What? Where did he go?? [outside the building on the transporter] EAT MY SKIDS! [teleports back to earth with Jake] YAAAAH! [sitting on the floor looking at the picture of him and the woman] Oh, Margles. MAGIC MAN! [shoots through the roof and punches Magic Man, knocking him out.] You fat coward! [Finn breaks the bottle] Go! Get out of here, tiny manticore! Whatevs. I didn't need your pity help! Jeez. What? I am the true coward. Hiding from sincere expressions like a vampire in the nude who hides from the light. Thank you, brave hero. I was freed from bottle jail, but my new prison...is shame. MY NEW PRISON IS SHAAAAME!!! What's he saying? [stretches his ear back through the door] He said his new prison is shame. [Sees Jake sitting in bed, staring at him] Wha—?! Jake, I told you to stop staring at me right at the time when I wake up. I'm staring because I can't move my head. [Laughs] No, really, I can't move. I can't move either. What's happening?! What? What was that? Who goes there? Hey! Who is that? Jake, use your peripheral vision! [Straining] Ooooh... [sees Ice King] Ice King! [Enters room laughing] I shouldn't be laughing, I'm sorry. Oh, I know, I'll do the opposite. [Crying] Oh, boohoo. [Wipes away tears, grunts] Ah, this is weird. What did you do to us, Ice King? Whoa, whoa. I didn't "do" anything to you, okay? C'mon, guys, I'm your friend. So why can't we move? Ooh, because I froze you... with this. [Holds up Freezing Potion A] [Reading bottle] Freezing Potion A. I sprayed it on you while you slept. [Jumping and grabbing at the bottle] Wenk! Wenk! No! Gunter, no! This one likes to break bottles, don't ya? [ Why are you doing this, Ice King? Why? Oh, because I love you guys. But you don't love me, do ya? You tried to kill us, like, four times. I only try to kill you 'cause you're princess-blocking me all the time! Anyway, now that you're frozen, we can bond and stuff. And the sooner we do, the sooner I can spray you with this. [Holds up Unfreezing Potion A] [Reading bottle] Unfreezing Potion A? Ah, I underlined the "un" so I wouldn't mix 'em up. Just unfreeze us now, man. Yeah, 'cause we're already friends. We are? Mm-hmm. What's my favorite color? Uh, yellow? Orange? Blue—no, no, lavender! Lavender! Yeah! Um, ooh, uh... rainbow? You don't love me. I know a lot about you guys. Jake, you don't put ice in your drink because you have sensitive teeth. Wha—? And Finn, your favorite food is meatloaf. How did you—? And Jake, sometimes you don't cry because you're afraid of real emotion. It's okay. Let it out. [Jake sheds a single tear] You don't love me— [Gunter knocks bottle out of [Slaps Ice King lightly] Wenk! You lock your bottles? Huh, in this economy? [Drops key into underwear] Ah, I'm gonna go make some lemonade. [Walks off] Don't touch my lemons, Ice King! Ice King! [Afraid] Jake, look! [Gasps] Gunter! No, Gunter! No! No, Gunter, no! Wenk! [Walks over to the bottles and starts clinking them together] No, Gunter! No! No! Gunter! No! Gunter, stop! Wenk, wenk! What're we gonna do?! [Eyes widen] When someone loses one sense, their other senses are enhanced—like a blind man who can smell and hear really well. I'm gonna try using my now-enhanced brain sense to make contact with an Astral Beast who will help us. What? Whee! Haha! Whee! Astral Beast, come to me! [Quietly] Come to me, Astral Beast... I've got lemonade! You want some, Jake? Huh? Gunter... [takes Gunter off the shelf and places him on the floor] No, Gunter! No bottles. Look at me. Wenk! [Laughs] What am I gonna do with you? [Laughs, conjures a leash made of ice] You're going to have to wear a leash. [Puts leash on Gunter, conjures Hand Snow Golem, hands leash to him] This should keep you out of trouble. [Turns to Finn and Jake] Now, our first bonding activity will be walking in each other's shoes—so to speak. To better understand each other's perspectives, we're going to dress up like each other. Me first! [Imitating Finn] It's adventure time! I'll save you, Princess! Let's have babies, Princess, and let's teach them to be good babies! Oh, Princess, sure, I'll kiss you. I'm a hero. Hey Finn, don't you think it's weird there's two Finns? Finn? [pats Finn's chest] Not talking? Now, I'm gonna dress like Jake. [starts taking his shirt off] Noooo! No, no, no, no, no! Okay, okay! We'll bond in another way. So, I wanted to show you something telling of my soul. I take artful black and white photographs of my penguins' body parts. Photography is art; let's see some art. [Switches on projector] Okay, first one. See how Gunter is staring into the camera? He's saying, "Here I am. Look at me. Accept me." Okay, second one. [Changes slide] This is a haunting image of a penguin's flipper. Look at how it penetrates the negative space. Oh yes, this one is very— I can't take this any more! Dang it, Finn! What are you doing in there? Astral Beast! Where are you? You come here NOW! [ ...Yeah, I've thought about it a lot, and having a little gallery show might be nice. A little cheese, a little cider... could be nice, y'know? [Key falls out of [Quietly] Key! Gunter. Gunter. Psst! Pssssst. Come here, Gunter. [Makes kissing noises.] [Clicks slide and continues commenting, oblivious] This next one is very rewarding... [Whispering] Grab it, Gunter. Pick it up! [Gunter reaches for the key] Pick it up!! [Gunter gets closer] What are you waiting for? Just grab it! Wenk. [Walks towards shelf] Wenk, wenk. Wenk, wenk, wenk, wenk, wenk. [Quietly] Gunter! Come back. Gunter! [Turns around] Weeenk. [Picking up Gunter] You are being naughty, Gunter. You've interrupted my thing. [Carries Gunter to the middle of the living room and sets him down by Finn and Jake] Now you stay right here and go to sleep. [Gunter flaps his flippers] Sleep. [Gunter falls asleep and starts snoring] Aw. So cute. Alright, back to art. [Quietly] Gunter. Gunter, wake up. [Gunter wakes up] Go... get... the... key. [Gunter starts playing with Okay, time for a break. Who wants lemonade? [ Wenk. [Closing cage] It's for your own good, sweetie. [Walks to the middle of the room] Now then. [Unfolds a cot] Wait, you're sleeping up here?! Well... [giggles] not before our next bonding activity late-night gab session! Do you want to talk about girls? Do you have a crush on anyone? Uh, yeah, my girlfriend? Lady Rainicorn? Ohhhhhh! Don't worry, I won't tell anyone. [Laughs] Know who I have a crush on? [Whispers] Princess Bubblegum. [Sarcastically] You don't say. Oh, I do. I've liked her for quite some time. Feels weird to say it out loud. [Starts snoring] What? [Groans] He fell asleep with his eyes open. Finn! Finn, snap out of it! Astral Beast! WHERE ARE YOU? Show yourself! Why not? Does this dance please you, Astral Beast? [Starts dancing] Does this please you?! THIS IS IIIIT! [Opens eyes] The Astral Beast cometh. [(Still dressed up as Finn) Crows like a rooster, laughs] Who's "hungie"? Jake, you "hungie"? I'm hungry. Alright, fair enough. Well, how 'bout I make us some omelettes? That sounds pretty good, actually. I'm gonna put my foot in it. Eating a part of me will bring us closer together. [Playing with Jake's feet] I'll be inside of you! [Laughs] Dude, you're back! Yup. I just got back from the Astral Plane! Where's your Astral Beast? It's on its way. It's gonna be awesome. What kind of beast? Uh, I'm not sure. I couldn't see it in the Astral Plane. But I heard it. It sounded really intense. [Blows away a butterfly] Maybe a gorilla? A gorilla, huh? [Butterfly lands on Aw, junk! Did I summon butterflies?! [Sighs] I'm the worst. Hey, come on now, you're not the worst. Yeah, I am. No, you're not! You're the best! ...at being the worst. [Strains] What are you doing? I'm using my enhanced brain sense to tell your astral beast to slap some sense into you. Oh. That's cool. I deserve it. [Strains] No... you... don't! [Putting foot into pan] Well, I don't want to use too much foot. It'll overpower the eggs. Take away from the omelette. [Butterfly flies toward him.] Huh? Aah! Finn! and Jake! and a bunch of butterflies! and a sword! What do you want from me? What do we wa—? We want you to unfreeze us, you lunatic! No! We're not friends yet. You haven't eaten my omelette. [Butterflies slap him repeatedly.] Friends don't eat each other, Ice King. That's not how friends work. Now unlock this bottle and unfreeze us. Oh, alright. I don't know how you're doing this, but it is impressive. Wait a minute... which bottle is thi—? [Sprays himself and falls to the floor] I think they brought me the wrong bottle. Gunter's still upstairs. [Calling] Gunter! Gunter! Gunter! Gunter!! [moaning sickly] Blankie me. Blankie me, Finn! I'll get your blanket dude, where is it? Right here. [touching the blanket on right side of his bed] Why don't you just get it yourself? Because I'm sick! [making a shriveled face] Poor guy... Too hot! [pushes the blanket off] URGGH! Oh man, Jake, is there anything I can do to make you feel better? Soup me, Finny. Soup-flavored cure coming on through. [sniffs and dumps the soup in Jake's mouth. Jake waits a bit, then swallows] Do you feel better now? Yes. [ Once upon a time... No! I already heard that story before. But you've all ready heard all of my stories before. Make me a new one, Finn. A new story. Okay... got it! Once upon a time... Nooo! [ What's the matter? I don't want a made-up story. I need a real story. Hmm. Now you hang on, my friend. I'll be right back. [goes outside] Okay, world, give me a story for Jake! [looks around] Huh! [he notices a leaf floating in the wind, with a snail riding the leaf. Oh my gosh! What is it? First, the leaf fell off a tree. But wa-w-w-wait. Spit it out. The snail was on the leaf. The end. Oh no, now I feel a thousand times worse. Finn, a story's gotta have excitement, romance... [his eyes turn shiny] ...suspense, [dragging out the word and pulling his eyelids down] and it has to have a happy ending. [sniffs] But I don't know how to make that stuff happen! That's okay, buddy. Just dig me a hole and -- actually, two holes. One for my guts and one for my face, 'cause when I die, my guts are gonna blow outta my face. I am not gonna let that happen, dude. Then go get me that story. [pulls out a paper] And make sure it has all the stuff on this list. I'll be back as fast as a can. I won't let your guts blow outta your face. [he goes outside runs over a log, and pulls out the list Jake wrote. It is poorly written and says, romance, fight, suspense, and a happy end] Hmm. Romance. That should be easy. [puts list in his pocket and looks around, then looks under a rock, finding two ants underneath] Hey, how 'bout you two. Are y'all in love? La ba ghee na goo da dee da? Uh... La na ghee ga ra la na! Umm. [puts rock down, hears squirrels napping, and looks in the tree where they are] Are y'all kissing in there? Ah! [chattering] [they run into each other and fall down] Hmm. Maybe I should smooooth out my approach a bit. ♪Normal guy, forest guy. Just like normal forest guy.♪ [trips over a stick] Whoa! [Stops when he sees a fox and a goose, Boobafina]. Hey, so, uh, yeah... so, yeah, can I, umm... can I watch you guys kissing? What!?! Uh! I just need to for my friend! He's really sick and unless I tell him about watching you guys kissing and... What a weirdo! You're one sick man, mister... [shakes his head] Yeah, what's this "friend's" [making airquotes] name, huh? Jake! His name's Jake. Yeah, right. Sounds pretty fake. C'mon, Boobafina, let's get out of here. Yeah. Wait! I'll do anything! [they look back at Would you eat dirt? I would for Jake! [eats some dirt] Okay, now you guys kiss. Man, what a freak. Let's go. What! No! Jake needs this! Stop! [he grabs them and pushes them together, forcing a kiss] Just come on! What? No! Ah, wait!!! [against their will, they kiss. Finn stops pushing them and throws them] AUGGH! [face reddening] You see, no big deal. I [coughs] can't believe you made me do that! I'm secretly in love with Mr. Goose, and now he'll never love me because now I'm soiled! [sobs and runs away] Oh no, oh no! I really did want to kiss Boobafina! I'm secretly in love with her! Okay, sweet! No, no. It had to happen naturally! Now she'll never love me! [sobs and runs away] Ugh! [slaps his forehead] That wasn't smooth, but it's all worth it to save Jake. Whatever it takes. Okay, a good fight... [ Oh heck yeah! I've been waiting for this my whole life! Yes! [laughs] Oh, no you don't! [smacks the teenage bear] You never let me do anything! Grr! [he tries to smack his mom, then jumps at Finn, who Finn punches him to the ground] You killed him! [wakes up] Mom, quit touching me! You killed him and now he's dead! [running away] He's probably not dead. I'm sorry though, that you think he's dead. Mmm, I don't want to hurt aminals, but - but Jake - [ Hey you guys, you wanna die? [the birds get scared and pass out. They fall out of the nest. The mom comes.] Boys! Boys! Have you seen my boys? [really scared] No! [Turns around and throws the rock on the ground which makes the birds fly away. He kicks the rock] Awwwwww, I can't do it! I keep messing with folks, aaaaaaaahh!!! [punches a tree] Jake needs me, but I can't keep messing with folks, but Jake's really sick, but I can't but, but, but, but...uhhh!!! [rubbes his arm] [owl hoots] [someone throws a rock at You'll see... [breathing hard] Hey, wait, this is really suspenseful! [then What is this? This is the Rite of Forest Justice! Huzzah! Finn the human boy, for your crimes of the inhabitants of the forest... you must enter the earth and become one with the soil... Don't I get a trial or something?! No! Lower the cage! Huzzah! [a rabbit begins lowering the cage] I'm totes gonna die... and now Jake won't get his story and he'll die too... because I still don't have a happy ending... huh?? Oo iggi, boo boo, oo iggi, boo boo, oo iggi, boo boo, oo iggi... Wait a minute! I may be busy dying... but you need to get busy living... Huh? Y'all living some unhappy lives. You, Boobafina... [bends down] You love Mr. Goose. You just need to tell him. What? She loves you... y'all just need to hook it up. I-I've been wanting to date you for years. You really love me? I do... Oh! Huzzah! And you Mr. Fox, you need to face facts man. Boobafina is not interested. It's time to move on. It's true... it's for the best. And hey, jerky teenage bear! What? Your mom is right. You shouldn't just go around fighting strangers in the forest. Yeah! [smacks him on the head] Momma bear, your son's not a baby anymore. You should stop spanking him in the face. He's right... It's time to let you grow up... Yeah! That's the stuff! Huzzah! And Mrs. Cow, take that bag off your udder. You're beautiful, girl. You live in the forest, so why don't you just let it hang out? Ewwwwwwww! Yo, put that bag back on. [they do so] Huzzah! Silence! Finn the Human, for meddling in our lives and disturbing the order of the forest... [stops making the blue swirl] we thank you. What?! [laughs] Our lives have improved since you came here. Does that mean you're going to release me? Your cage is made of sticks, brother. Just kick it apart. Cool! [He breaks the cage and lands on the ground] Yeah! I'm coming for you, Jake... with a story!!! And then what happened? [coughs] And then everyone in the forest was happy... The end. Huuuuuuuuh!!! What's wrong?! That was... [he stretches his arms and legs and shakes them] perfect! I feel a million times better! Really? Yeah! The romance stopped my fever... the suspense cured my headache... and everything else cured everything else! I'm not sick, I'm not sick! Ha ha! Neat. [coughs and lays his head on his knees] [dancing] Finn, c'mon! Dance the health dance with me. Nah, I'm good. [sneezes] You allergic to my health dance? [lies down] No, I just feel bad. Ohhhh... Finn, did you catch my sick? [snoring] The end. [turns the lights off] OH MY GLOB! Time is a slippery devil. Our lives are sudden. They come and go like like a Summer Shower. And here at this site, my Great Uncle Gumbald cut down all these taffy trees in a single night. 'Cause those trees were evil... right, Princess Bubblegum? Nah. Hey, but I bet they have a ton of stories about your human relatives. Um... not really. I've never even met any other humans. If I think about it too much, I get all soul-searchy and weeeeiiirrrd... [Embarrassed] Ohhh, boy... I've made things awkward. Well, let's forget about that. I brought you guys here because I need you to rip out all these stumps! [Half-heartedly, in a daze] Okay... I guess so... Yeah, man, it'll be fun! [Shrinks and gets in Finn's hand] Toss the [Spiritedly] SPA-MOW!! [To Finn] I'm glad to see you out of that funk... about being the only huma... [Her voice trails off; she realizes what she said and gets embarrassed] I mean... [Walking away] Well! I'm gonna scram! No hard feelings right? [Exits] Again, man! [Throwing Jake] Huck! Ow!! Whoa... I don't think this is a stump. [Running over] Huh? [Moving bush] It's a hatch. A hatch? [He jumps on it and opens the lid.] We should check it out, ya think?! [He jumps down.] [Excitedly] Waaah! Heh-heh. [ What a dump! [Finn's flashlight goes out. He tries to get it working again.] Can you imagine the jerks that musta lived here? [Turning to look] Huh?! AAAAH!! AAAAH!! AAAAH!! [They run backwards with a start and run into a pile of junk. Another figure emerges. Wee meeb youp nuh hur! [Presumably "We mean you no harm!"] SHAHOW!! [Presumably "Shadow!!"] [The other creatures gasp.] O my gra cup-ssah! [She hides in a refrigerator.] These people are so terrified... Scared of their own shadows... We could rule them... like gods! [Deviously] ...Angry gods... [To humanoid] Don't be scared, c'mon. [The creature walks towards [Whispering] Shh. They're startled. Ya gotta be gentle with wild animals. I don't think they're animals, Jake. I think... this could be... a tribe of... humans!! [Laughs happily] What are these guys doing down here in this crummy hole? I don't know, man. Maybe they just don't know any other thing. [To creatures] Hey, fellows! Don't you wanna get out of here?! I could take you to see the sun! [The female creature tilts her head. Suhhhn... Ow la koo sow suhn. [Presumably an agreement that she'll look at the sun.] You poor things... Living down here has made you all weird, hasn't it? [The creatures duck behind the trash and mumble to each other.] Jake, I've got to save these guys! They're my people, and it's my duty to lead them outta this gross cave! Starting with you, Miss, uh... [Grasping for her name] Suuhh... suhhhn... [Presumably "Sun."] ...Susan? [Susan stands up.] Pleased to meet you! Well, let's bring 'er up! [Patting Jake, to Susan] C'mon. Aw, man, you're gonna love it up here, Susan! [Squinting] Huh? There's all sorts of wonders top-side! Aah! AAH!! Susan, it's just grass. Ooooh! Mah back!! [To Susan] Grass can't hurt you. [Patting grass] See? Graaaahhhss... [She lands on the ground and feels the grass.] Huh... huh... huh. [She slams her face to the ground.] Oop. Ya killed 'er. Wha?! I did?! Yep. Felled by surface-world germs. [Susan starts scurrying with her face still planted in the ground. Finn scowls at Hahahahahahahaha! Two be cah reh ss... buh a thuh ahp fer ger... ss. Aw, Susan... You got grass blood all over your face. [Tries to wipe her with handkerchief] [Scared] YEEH!! ITSA PA TUH MUP! Susan... a hankie won't hurt you. [Taking it] Ohhhh. [She wipes herself.] [Frustrated sigh] How'm I supposed to show 'er the wonders of Ooo if every little thing freaks her out? [Semi-French pronunciation] Patience... Very well. Then I shall introduce Susan to Ooo... by degrees! [Scared] Manee mah nuhp lehp! That can't hurt you! That's a dancing bug! [The beetle starts dancing. That's just a rock. [Punching it away] A low-level enemy. [Relieved sigh] Jus a rah. ["Just a rock."] [She hugs another rock and squeezes it until it shatters.] What's wrong?! [He spots the beaver.] Hey, hey, hey, it's okay! [He feeds the beaver a marshmallow.] See? [Singing and looking around] Hm, hah, prety go-ah-suh pattah! ["Pretty golden patterns!"] Hey, Jake, how's your marshmallow, man? Golden as a wheaty sunset! How's yours? [Staring at inflamed marshmallow] Hmmm... [He blows out the flame and eats the marshmallow.] Perfect! [Muffled] How's yours, Susan? Heh. That's adorable. Hup! MMMM!! Ohhh... Tha is goo!! [Presumably "That is good!!"] [ Dang... She is way into candy. Hey, yeah! Susan! We should take you to the Candy Kingdom! Everything is candy there! You know, she may be too excited about candy. [Shrugging notion off] Nah... [Breathing extremely hard; mouth watering profusely] CAAANDY KING-DOOOM! I've enjoyed your visit immensely, Susan Strong. [Whispering] Finn! Yeah, Suze? [Whispering] Finn, where's all the candy yuh werp talk ah bout?! [Presumably "Finn, where's all the candy you were talking about?!"] Oh, well, it's... everywhere! The buildings, the lamp posts, even the people! We're all candy here! [Excitedly] CANDY! CANDY! [Slobbers on Peppermint Butler] Susan! [Pulling Peppermint Butler away] Susan!! No! You can't eat the ones that talk! They're special! They got aspirations. [ [Ashamed] Ohh-ho. [Scowls] It's okay. You're learnin'. Here. [Tears a piece of the pavement out.] Have some sidewalk brittle instead. [He puts in Susan's mouth, and she eats it.] Mmm! [Finn smiles at her.] Now, I gonna get friends. We eat all of Candy Kingdom. [Shocked] What?! Oh. No, no, no, no, no. We won't eat red stripe man. Only everyone else. [Running away] Bye! Susan, no!! [Runs to Candy Kingdom entrance] No!!! You can't eat the Candy People!! [Tired sigh] Oh, boy... So now what? Fight the humans to the death when they attack? No, man! They're my peeps! We have to save the Candy Kingdom without hurting them. They're gonna what?! Don't worry! We have a plan! We just have to scare the humans away! Very well. I shall gather my citizens in the courtyard... and you shall see how terrifying the Candy People can be! [Mock-scary] Ah-bloo-bloo-bloo!! [Giggles] [Whispering to Finn] They're doomed. [Calming them down] Just grass! Jus grah... Ahh, these candy weapons are too cute to be scary. Good news, Finn! I've managed to make my people horrifying! But how?! [Drops candy weapon] I've disguised them as gruesome creatures, like witches, and ghouls!  Aw, so cute! I just wanna give them candy! [To Gumdrop Girl] Quick! Show me your scary face!! Oh, uh... [Shining flashlight in her face.] Rawr. I don't think that'll scare anybody... NO DUH! She's...um...! She's... [Noticing her menacing shadow] Hey! Princess. I need a little wagon and your biggest roll of wax paper. Now, Princess Bubblegum! [Princess Bubblegum lets the wax paper come rolling down.] Now, Jake! [Jake puts logs on a fire in a wagon. The Candy People's shadows emerge on the wax paper, and the tribe gets scared.] It's working... [To tribe] Wah!! Just shadows! Aw, man! They've learned how to learn! Hide yourselves, Candy People! I'll try to make Susan see reason! The Marshmallow Kids never run from a scrap! [To others] Come on, fellas! [They charge] Today... we are man-mallows! [Jake inhales deeply and blows the fire with a giant gust.] Huh? [The Marshmallow Kids are engulfed in flames.] Please, fellow humans! The Candy People are no threat to you! CHARGE!!! WAIT!! STOP!! DUCK!! MY PEOPLE!! [One of the tribe members pulls off his hood to reveal a fish-like head.] HUH?!?! [Another tribe member pulls off his hood to reveal his fish-like head.] WHA?!? [All of the tribe members reveal their non-human heads.] They're... they're not humans? [They run off. Susan starts to follow, but then stops and stares at Is everyone okay? [The Marshmallow Kids are pulling off burnt skin.] Marshmallow Kids? We'll just be gooey for a while. [Running up to Finn] Hey, buddy! We did it! Finn? You okay? Jake, do you think she was human, or just another wild animal? [Beat] We're all wild animals, brother. [Low, quiet voice] Yeah... I guess we are... brother. Wait, I was hunting a vampire... [closes eyes] The Moon. Cut it out! That's not helping her. But Mom and Dad always burped on us. It's a cure-all! Sorry, guys. There are no cure-alls. Your parents were just burping on you for kicks. Oh, yeah, that makes sense. [belches] Oh, sorry, last one. Huh! [covers nose] What did you eat, Jake?! Hey, now! I pride myself in having nice-smelling burps. Just kidding. Pride... hmm. Do you guys know what "hubris" is? It's like an old-timey deity who weighed your deeds on a scale. No. It means excessive pride or arrogance. That's like you, PB. Dude. No, it's true. I believed in myself so much that I was blind to the possible consequences. Don't believe in yourself so much then, Dum-dum. [tearing up] Now my best friend is dying of poison because of me. That ain't true, PB. Marcy took a risk, and you helped her because you're her friend. Real friends take each other to the edge of death—'cause death is life! Right, Finn? Shoot, yeah! I get poisoned all the time just doing the dishes! I get poisoned on purpose, for research. I have a poison lab back at the castle. Well, let's get our butts over there then! Find The Moon, Finn. We'll work on an antidote. You guys take her back to the poison lab. Maybe we can extract her healing powers. Word! Hey, wait! What should I do? You guys? [grunts] [shudders and laughs] Moon pearls... We're on her trail. Gross! I think they're pretty. What if they're, like, her boogers... or worse? Come on, Jake. Ew, ew, ew, ew! Sometimes I think vampires were invented just to torment me. Whoa. I don't think so, man. I think you might have a hubrits. I'm just saying it's a possibility. Hey, look! The moon's pontoon. See?! I hate it! What it this, some hut the Moon plopped out of her bod? I don't think so. This mummy job looks like it used to belong to that mummy job. Still hate it. What's that, pickles? Ew. Yeah, that's her. Shouldn't she, like, explode or something? She just healted that sword right out of her bod! Let's try frying her up in the sun. Oh, yeah. Wow! How are we supposed to destroy this stay-fresh creep? Hmm. Let's stick with P.B.'s plan and try staking her a bunch of different ways. Hmm Higher Higher. Lower. Up Lower Perfect. [Princess Bubblegum kick the door] Whoa! Hey! Ah! What are you doing here, former Princess Bubblegum? Did you forget that you lost the election? Monarchies are not democracies! What?! Oof! Aah! Ooh Hey! Banana Guards, seize her! Uh, princess, should we listen to him? No, just keep him out of my way! And untie Crunchy! Thank you, Your Princessness! Man, we've been doing this for hours. You know, it's weird that P.B. wanted us to stake her back, instead of us taking her back. Wait. "Taking" or "staking"? She said "you guys, 'sztake' her back. " No, yeah! She said, "you guys, take her back. " So which one should we do? Both, I guess. We'd better hurry before she wakes up at sundown. Whoops. Get her back in the vase! Come get us, blood bucket! What?! Run! Here she come! Dude, for real, why'd you make her chase us? Marci needs her healing powers. "Stake her back" to the castle, bro! Shoot, just don't let her near my deli tray! Well, run harder, dude! Okay. Man, she is really booking it hard! You see that, Jake? No, bro, just let me run! Holy stink! She's smiling right at me! I don't need a play-by-play, man! She's messing with us. What do you mean?! I mean she's not catching up on purpose! Why do you think that? She's giving me this look... Slow down so I can talk to her. No, boy, you crazy! Just do it! I won't let her bite you! Okay, my life is in your hands, man! Hey. We're leading you to a trap. We're gonna suck out your healing power and dust you. And then I'm gonna put your dust in a litter box. And get a tiger to drop a huge smelly tiger bomb on your sorry dust clumps! Stop hitting my butt! You run in the path of my light. That's her voice?! How can you lead me when I am your guide? Are you being literal or allegorical? [Moon laugh evil] Me no like! Run, Jake, run! But she said I'm running in her light! Who gives a donk?! Just go! All right, where's your measuring equipment? I need to see some charts! And tubes Where are your tubes? This process uses no tubes and involves no quantifiable measurements. Calm your mind and let the crystal medium work its magi Its science. All right, Pep. I just wish I could do more for her. [Banana Guard cry] There, there. We're all worried about Marceline. That's not really why I'm crying. Princess, we really miss you! [All Come on, guys, it's all right. [Banana Guard hugs the Shh, shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Okay, finished. That's it? You just go, "shu, shu, shu" with your hands? Don't question my methods! This is my world. Okay, what now, then? We wait, like, two hours. Oh. Let's do something else. Like what? Mm, video games? I don't like video games. Me neither. I don't even have a system to play on or anything. I got a video game back at my place. But I just got it so I could stay in shape. How do you get in shape playing a game? Uh It's like a yoga video. So it's not a game at all. No, it is. It's a video game. Uh, it's a video. Yes. A yoga video. Game. A game. Video. You guys. We brought The Moon! What do we do? Die like pigs! Hold her off till Marci wakes up! She's not doing anything. You gonna try something? Okay, I guess. Whoops! What was that?! I don't know, man, I think I just got tapped out! "Tap out"? When do you ever tap out? Pigs! She's doing something weird! Jake, help! I can't! I feel like I'm in a slow-motion terror dream! Banana Guards, help! Princess, I can't stop her! You kind of have to, Finn! Rats! Okay, let me get my sword. Marceline. It's locked, dipstick! Open, pig! Open, pig! Pigs! Come on, Marci, wake up! Wake up! It's spring again And the yard is full Of tiny flowers You used to call them weeds And you killed them al But they were growing too tall What?! I can't hear you! I said, "Wake up, Marceline." What?! Wake u-- Huh? Pigs! Pigs! You! Marceline! Pigs, pigs! Did you just yell "pigs" at the lock until it opened? Oh! In your face! Marci, now! Finn. Yes! Finn, she's dead. Oh, thank glob. [Grunts as he opens the door with his foot, then opens the fridge with his foot and begins pouring in the eggs.] Boiled eggs. In the fridge. Jake! You're back! I've missed you so mu- Oh. Uh, hi Finn. It's just me. Jermaine! You and Jake both have sort of a grapefruit nature to you. I came to your playhouse because I'm worried about Jake. Don't worry, he's fine. He left a note. How long ago did he leave that? Uh, I dunno. Maybe five weeks? [Groans and exhales sharply] Whoo. Finn, you know you can call me if you're in trouble, right? Our brother's missing, and I come here finding you doing a lazy man's load with a hundred boiled eggs. It's all they have at the store. [Sits on the floor] I'm just worried, 'cause I had a dream about Jake - a vision. I think he's all alone in outer space. I don't think he can come home, and he's running out of birthday cake and cocktail hot dogs. Jake's in space?! [Brushing something off his head] I know! It's chilling. Hmm. Oh! So, this cosmic stuff, planets and space... [He begins writing a note. A pen lid in his mouth muffles his speech.] This is Normal Man-type subjects. [He spits out the lid and slaps the note onto the fridge alongside Jake's. It reads "BRB - Mars?! [Grunts and gets up.] Is it too much to hope that "Mars" is the name of some bookstore you like? Is that a boat? I haven't seen a boat in years. Ah, this is a pretty old house. What's that on the shelf? A little pegasus? Into the basement. Sure is lots of broken glass and decay down here. I'll be honest - I was just talking a lot because I'm nervous. [Grabs the handles of the Martian transporter.] I know. [Whispering] Jake. [Whimpers, panting, coughs, then speaks hoarsely] Mars. Dang. Looking real prosperous around here. Who's the statues, do you think? Maybe Margles? But I've only seen a photo of her. Wait! Betty? Oh, Finn. Uh, how is- I haven't seen you, Betty, since you double-crossed everyone. I- Ya slopped up! Finn! Empathy! [He climbs out from the pile of sand.] Normal Man. Nay! Oh. I'm trying to get better. I'm filling this hole with sand - grain by grain. [She drops another grain into the hole.] We're going to cure Betty's obsession with the Ice King and the magical madness inflicted upon her. [Glitches out.] G-G-G-G-Gah If you inflicted it on her, shouldn't you be filling the hole? Empathy, Finn. [He noogies Finn.] Aah! Okay, so, Jake's in space. Yeah. And you don't know where in space. Yeah. And you don't know where in space, even though literally every single place in this dimension is [air quotes] "in space". Again, yeah. You are a real cutie. Okay, here we are. To locate Jake, you will need to retrieve our space telemetry capsule - deep within Mars at the end of a deadly three-part mind maze. [Whimpers] Don't fret, cowardly dog. Betty will go with you. I... should really get back to my sand. Nah. You should come with us. Now, only Martians may enter the maze, so you'll need hats to fool the guard over there. Okay, cool. Where are the hats? Space. Wha- Aw, come on, man! [Groans] Eeh! [Talking to the guard.] Um, Door Man? [Looking up from his book] I'm Well, I am Boy Man. Uh, and I'm... Jer Man. Sure. [Looks back down at his book.] [Whispering to Jermaine] "Jer Man" was really funny. Thanks, Finn. Hey Jermaine, get a load of these frogs. What do you think's going on with all these frogs, Jermaine? Jermaine? What? I don't know. Oh, whoa. That one looks different - kinda... special. Yip! [He ducks the frog.] Remember! Whew! Finn! I'm okay. These guys mean business, though. If you look them in the eyes, they get outraged. You got all that, Betty? Betty! Hup! Oh! There's more on this side. [Growls] Hyup! Guys, I think I figured out the frog puzzle. [Jermaine pulls her hat over her mouth, and her speech is muffled.] It's really quite simple. I found the next challenge! I think maybe if I solve this equation, we'll be able to pass through to the next chamber. And if we mess up, that guy pecks our tummies open, right? [He gestures at the Ice Thing.] No. See, the work is already full of errors. I just need to correct them. Um, I'm not trying to complain or anything, but none of these puzzles have anything... to do with... me. [Speaking over Jermaine] Look see? This quadrinomial has been improperly factored. He forgot to double cube root the bottom partial nominator. [She magically produces a piece of icy chalk and corrects the error on the blackboard.] There we go. I'll have us out of here in no time. Well, just let me know if you need any help - with anything besides these maths problems. [Muttering to herself] X plus square, hypotenuse cubed plus Y minus three... [Muttering continues.] [Gasps] [Chuckles] Hey! He's jukin' the stats! What? He's changing the dang numbers around! He's changing. Oh no. [Climbing towards the Ice Thing] Come on, Jermaine! Up there? You're gonna break your neck! [Laughs and takes off.] Hey! [Groans and rubs his head] If anyone else feels like solving any of these puzzles, just jump right in, you know? Hey! Over here! I hear something. ...if you water them once a week they'll totally be fine. No! I know! Six months studying ancient petroglyphs in the Outback?! [Squeals] I can't believe it! [Her conversation continues indistinctly in the background.] That's me. Uh-doy! You looks so happy. And sane. [Sighs] I was. But I never took that trip. I met Simon the next day, and he was just so amazing. I put everything on hold to help him search for the Enchiridion. Listen, Betty, I may not be a psychiatrist or a life coach, or even know what you're talking about, but maybe you should try focusing on yourself a little more, you know? Can I though? I spent so much time dedicated to Simon I'm not sure there's even any "me" left anymore. Good point, Future Betty! Maybe it is too late to save you, but with your power and my joie de vivre-ay, maybe the two of us could save Simon together! Think about it. Oh, come on, Betty! Get it together! Even if you are a lost cause, she- -Or whatever she represents- -is not. Or am I? [Blinks innocently] No, Finn's right. You'll thank me for this later, Past Hmph. [Speaking on the phone] And don't forget to water my plants. Okay, got to go! My flight leaves in an hour! Good job, Betty. Thanks, Finn. Sorry I couldn't be more help. I was a little preoccupied. Oh really? Anyway, where's the space thingy? [Chanting] Space thingy! Space thingy! Space what-y? Jake! Hey everybody. Hey, long time no see, brudda! [Scratches Jake's head.] [Laughs] Hey, what's with the hair, brudda? Man, you're lucky you missed it. I had lice crazy-bad! I think I got them from Marceline, who got them from Ice King. [Laughs] Nice. Anyway, how'd you even get here? Eugggh! [Drops the hats he is holding.] Beats me. I was just eating a sausage on some stupid planet, then all of a sudden there was a beautiful rainbow explosion and a loud noise - sort of like a space telemetry capsule activating. Then here I was, standing next to this Mars door. Congratulations, everybody. Now, who's ready for a nice boiled egg? Me! Me! Wait a minute. What even happened in there? Where's the telemetry capsule? Don't you see, Jermaine? You were inside the capsule all along, learning valuable lessons while you programmed its Jake-extracting telemetry with your minds. Of course. And you, Betty - finally you've learned that most pressing of lessons - that sometimes, for our own good, we must accept the loss of that which we hold most dear. [Imitates a buzzer] I've learned that I just got to work even harder to get it back. What?! Like, did you see Finn in there? He was indomitable! Yeah I guess but- So as I stared into that endless white void, I came up with a plan. A plan? For me, to save my Simon, and for you, to finally pull Margles back from the maw of GOLB. [Gulps] Marg- [Coughs] [Flies out the window] [Yawns] [hums while walking through the forest] Ice King, this the last time you steal our sandwiches! You don't understand! If you were me, you would do things I would do! Yeah, and if you were us, you'd kick your fat butt! I ... yeah, I would... but I wouldn't get past my invincible armor! Yaah! [Kicks against armor but causes no damage. [Laughs] Not a scratch, boys! Not a scratch! It's my time to shine! [Yelps] [Shouting in fear] Wuuuuh-wuuuh! [hums while he fixes his cart] [Barks playfully] [Gets angry] [Emanates fire and barks while watching Snow Golem away] Fools! Fools! You're wasting your ti-yime! [Sighs] [panics] Wuh? Wuuuh-wuuuh! Wuuuh! Wuuuuh! [Manages to put out the fire on his body.] [Calms down and notices that the pup caused the fire.] [Barks, turns around and blows a raspberry] Ehh ... [Picks up the pup with a piece of the cart, opens the door and throws him out of his house.] [He shuts the door and opens it again when he hears the pup moaning and shivering from cold. He again closes the door and opens it again, this time seeing some vultures trying to eat the pup.] Wuh! Wuuuh! [Puts out the flames with his hands and removes pup from the kitchen with a branch so that it cannot burn anything.] Hmmm. Wuuuh! Wuuh! [Blows what's left of his finger and tries to ease the pain] Ah! Ahh ... Geesh ... [The pup is sad] ... [mutters reassuringly] Bo, bo, bop [Fixes his finger (again with face) with a snowball and tries to entertain the pup again.] Huh? Wang nyangah yuh?! [Sleeping] Fools, fools, fools... [snore] In-ice-able vince armor... Help! Help! Somebody help me! Ah! Oh, sweet mama! Got you now! Yeah! Aah! You can have the sandwiches back! I'm sorry! Help! Bye-bye. Boy, those sandwiches look really cool! [Finn continues eating] It looks like it'd be really awesome to try a bite of one of those [Jake also claims and continues to eat] ... right on, right on. You ... the ... real good. Nice... home. Jake, do you think that puddle needs our help? Nah, it's a Snow Golem, man. I think he's laughing. I thought Snow Golems and Fire Wolves hated each other. Oh, yeah, big time. But they learned to get along. Yup. You know ... maybe we could all learn a thing or two from those sandwiches. [Pause] ... Thank you. Road trip! Check out this sweet make out wagon! [walks between the seats, he comes to the Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving] Life giving magus bro! Yo, yo, yo! Yo, yo. [turns to Ron James] Ron James bro! Whazzup! Not much, not much. [turns to Little Dude] Finn's old hat bro! Uh, name's " Sure, sure. [turns to Beau] Hey, uh.. It's Beau bro, right! [turns to Leaf Man] Leaf Man bro! [turns to Giuseppe] And, uh...[turns to Abracadaniel] Who's this guy? I don't know. We just picked him up. That's the kind of trip this is gonna be. It's a "destiny will guide us" kind of thing. [turns back to Giuseppe] How 'bout we call you...Giuseppe. [Giuseppe farts] That's right, Giuseppe. Okay, Ron James, it's time. A'ight, listen up, brahs. Here's the plan. [throws a vial of white powder, revealing black smoke] Ooooh. We're heading for Big Butt Rock. At sundown, we'll gather on the Cheek's Peak, and using the ah-has, deep feels, and woo-woos we score from the journey, we will chant a totally original spell, thus forming an entirely new school of magic! [goes back to the bus] Kind of like those jerky secret societies, but less jerky. [blows the smoke away] Just got one more stop. [stops the bus at the Tree Fort and gets out of the bus] Finn and Jake's crib? They won't come. They're out of our league. [from inside the tree fort] Hey, Abracadaniel's here, with a bus full of lame wizards. [getting massaged by BMO] Here we go. They're probably gonna try to lure us on some dumb trip. Hey, water nymphs! Uh...hi. Uh...do you girls feel like, uh...going on a road trip? Um...no thanks. Okay, but what if I...[straining, he uses his wand to create a rainbow] Ew. [still on the bus, shouts to the nymphs] Hey, ladies! Hellooo. Whoa, do you guys know this person? No, but his eyes are just...[shows Ron James' eyes sparkling, with him holding a vial of Eye Twinkles] gorge. Oh. Here we go! Wooo! [the bus' engine stops] Uh, why'd we stop? I think we ran out of gas. [a loud clank is heard] And the wheels fell off! Well, this ain't goin' the way we planned, but fate has decreed that this place is just what we need. Draw your inspiration from this muddy, old cow pasture. Here, bros. [hands Ice King a roll of toilet paper] We got a stock full of T.P. and magic ink. [gives everyone else a roll of t.p.] Let's all write down arcane, cryptic words in unexpected new combinations and patterns. Maybe the nymphs can dance on top of the bus to be, like, our muses. Inspire us, water nymphs! We don't want to. We'd rather write. I'll dance if dancing is needed. [starts singing] Doo-doo doo doo-doo. Yah yah, doo-doo wah [takes a vial of ink from Abracadaniel and climbs on top of the bus, rolls the t.p. across the bus and dances a bit] Dance, dance, dancin' dance writing. [puts ink on his feet and dances across the t.p.] I'm dance, dance, dance, dancin'. Top of the bus, window... Hey, check it out, y'all. The dirty old stranger's writing, too. [Ron James pats Giuseppe] What's all the ruckus?! I own this pasture, so get back in your vehicle and get! [shakes his gun in the air] We can't! Our wheels fell off! [the farmer gets ready to fire his gun, Are you gone? I can't really see! [groans] Oh! [Abracadaniel gets out and climbs by the Is there a problem? I ran out of juice. Can I take over? Yeah, maybe you should. Hey, let's switch headgear. [he gives Abracadaniel his crown and Abracadaniel gives him his headband] Ooh, it fits! [Abracadaniel giggles, shaking his hands and sprinkling snow out] Yeah, girl, just let the ice magic flow. [Abracadaniel starts shooting ice out] Oh, b-but be careful, okay? What? [turns to Ice King and has the ice aiming past him] Oh! [laughs nervously] Not me. [Abracadaniel starts making a road] Nice ice road. Thanks. Hey, I don't think we're moving. Uh, hold on. [gets back on the bus] Everyone, time to push the bus! Eh, I don't really want to. Come on! Destiny! [all grumble and get out of the bus and start pushing it] Okay, back on the bus! Back on the bus! [driving the bus] Huh? Ooh, a crabapple tree. Giuseppe, make yourself useful and grab us some of them crabapples. [Giuseppe stops writing on his t.p. and goes to the door of the bus] Okay, get ready. Jump! [Giuseppe jumps to the tree and picks up the crabapples, the bus speeds up and he can't catch up] Oh, no! Giuseppe can't catch up! What?! Magus of Life Giving, take the wheel! [goes to the bus' back door] Uh, okay, but I am not a confident driver. [climbs on his back] You're doing great, buddy. Don't touch me! [bats Little Dude away] Giuseppe, throw the crabapples! [Giuseppe throws them and he catches them] Giuseppe? [sees that Giuseppe is too far away] We have lost Giuseppe. [gives Leaf Man a crabapple and eats one himself] Mm! Hmm? Well, let's see what old Giuseppe wrote. [picks up Giuseppe's toilet paper, reads it and gasps] Listen to this, everybody! "These are not my tear drops, daughter dear, but just a sheen of dew that lingers here, past other fields where other fathers lie, who kept their daughters better far than I." [sniffles] What do you guys think? [everyone is crying] What's wrong with you guys? Look who's talking. [sniffles] Huh? [wipes his eyes] This is true art. [blows his nose on the paper] Well, let's see what you other guys wrote. [takes their papers] Little Dude, here's yours. "Days don't have shades, directions with no ways, adjusting minimum scholarly curriculum to enrich empty minds, it takes refracted sunshines." That is awesome. "Take this light with your great might, free hearts that are gated seeing truth in things exaggerated." Ah, some interesting spell combos going on guys. Ice King! I see the Butt Rock! The hour of glory is upon us. Cauldron! [a cauldron comes, he puts the papers into it, murmurs incantations and everyone falls asleep] Smells so good down here! What's cooking? [falls asleep, the bus stops by a lake] [snoring, gurgles water and wakes up and screams, waking everyone else up, showing the bus half sunk in a lake] Girls, we can help. [the nymphs get out of the bus] Okay, one, two, three! Lift![they try to lift the bus] Ow! Ow. Um...let's get out of here. [they swim away] No, don't go. [puts his crown back on] Hey, I could freeze all of us. Then we'd be safe from drowning, and once someone discovers our preserved bodies, we'll be saved! Be like, 200 years, tops! [everyone grumbles] Oh! Let me try this! [takes his right mitt off and touches the bus] Mommy! Oh Grob, I can't swim! Aah! Oh Glob! Ymmom! Somebody! Sorry. I was hoping it wouldn't come to this. My "last resort" poshe, obtained from a mad yogi in the Mystery Mountains. It's time to find out what it does. [opens it, drinks some of it] Ba-bam! [his head is replaced with Tree Trunks's] Nice and slow. Ooh, gent--oh! [goes back to [scratching Ron James' head instead of Tree Trunks' back with a back-scratcher, [laughing] Oh, I'm flying! [takes the vial from Ron James' hand] Yoink. Take my head away from here, baby! [drinks the rest of the vial, his head is replaced with the Life Giving Magi's] No! [all scream] Maybe this is a test from destiny, guys! If we all just surrender to these events, the answer will reveal itself. [inhales deeply, the bus starts glowing blue and shaking] Whoa. Wha? [looks out the window] Hey, it's Giuseppe! [Giuseppe sets the bus down, Ice King comes out] [everyone else comes out of the bus] Giuseppe, how have you done this? [Giuseppe gives them a thumbs-up, turns into blue sparkles and goes on the trees] Whoa. What was he? I don't know, Abracadaniel, but I think he was trying to show us something. Something new. [fist pumps Abracadaniel, it shows the view of the blue sparkles which are shaped like Giuseppe's head, and the right eye winks] Sploo! Jicka haka boogy noona hubba gubba--secret wizard handshake! Later, Chinchizerd! Bye, Berdzerd. [Berdzerd flies away, he waves, Abracadaniel walks by, whispers to Berdzerd] See you at the secret thing tonight! [turns to Abracadaniel] Loser. [scene showing the crabapple tree without Hour ​​six of our Ice Kingdom stakeout. Abso-nothing's going on there. [Reading a ninja manual] And if I do this hand position, [he positions his hand] my boogers should turn into smoke bombs. Pfff. You sure this tip is good, Flambo? [surrounded by logs like a campfire] Come on, you know I'm on the level. The Ice King is scheming to nabs a princess today. I swears it. Hmm. Relax, Restless Pants. A true ninja can sense the intentions of his enemies. [He shifts his ears into a symbol] Jin. [Laughs] Ninjas? Ninjas ain't real for nothing, no how. Whoa, now—ninjas are real. For you see, [covers his mouth with his sweater] Doo, doo, doo... Jake and I are ninjas. Yep, ever since we fished this ninja manual out of a ditch. Finn, booty me! [Jake throws the booties and Jake catches them on his feet] Listen! Finn, I think I'm gonna take off my booties. I can't flip these pages. Gunter, let's go! I've got the overnight bag. Wenk, wenk! It's the Ice King, all right, and he's looking awful pleased with himself. Uh-oh. If the Ice King's so happy, he must have stolen a princess when we weren't looking, somehow. [covers his mouth with his ears] That's ninja logic. Then we gotta... [Interrupts] Ahem. ...we gotta save that princess. You got it, shino-bro! Ninja kick! Ninja kick! Princess? Princess! [Sniffs the floor and raises an armchair with his arm like a jack] Princess? [Looking in the jail] Princess! [Looking in the toilet] Princess? ...Ahh... No princess here, man. No princess? [Gasps] It's... a trap! We're being trapped! Ninja vanish! Evade! Evade! Nothing is trapped, dude. We can't find any captured princesses, because the Ice King hasn't captured one yet. He's out doin' it right now. Are you sure? [confident] No. It's only a ninja hunch, so we should ninja snoop for proof. Wait, man. I-I feel uncomfortable snooping through Ice King's personal stuff. It feels sorta like... [darkly] a violation. [Pulls out a book from under a pillow on the bed] Whoo! Got the Ice King's diary. [shakes his head] No, no, no, no, no! We can't read his private junk! [Tries to stop Jake] And yet we must. [clears his throat and takes the form of the Ice King] Dear diary—and you better write me back this time!— [not actually reading] today I'm bringing home a special new cutie. There's our proof, man! ... Hmm, alright. Let's use our ninja stealth and hide until he comes back with the princess. Or... we could keep looking through his stuff. Heh, heh, heh! You know, for more proof? Hehehe! No. [Stops Jake] Alls we're gonna do is lie in wait until the Ice King gets back. Then—BOOM [pokes Jake]—we catch him with princess on his hands. [Starts playing with Jake like a plane] Where are we gonna hide? In this filthy hamper! [He tosses Jake in the basket and then jumps in after him.] Think he's there yet? See anything? Nah. Hey, Finn, I don't want to hide in the hamper anymore; it reeks in here. But we're ninjas! And this is our ninja hideout. Nah, man. My sense of smell is, like, one thousand times better than yours. Also, the hamper's boring. I'm out. Wait! I'm out! Jake! Get back here! [Throws a meatball at him, which hits Ice King's computer] [Jake goes to the computer.] Hey, wait up! Check this out! Weird. I want to draw something. Hey! [Try to stop Jake] We gotta leave no trace! Ninjas leave no trace! I'll delete it after! Hey, come on! [gasps] Jake, what have we done? [gasp] A secret hidden room full of ninja stuff! [Entering the hospital] Oh, great—a line. [starts to freeze the people in front of him] Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Uhh, I-I think you were actually ahead of me. [Freezes Rock Man] You know I was. [laughs] [Approaches to management] Counter maid, I demand medical attentions, [softens his voice] preferably those of a princessy type. And are you checking in as a patient or a cadaver? Hey! I'm as healthy as ten old men! Ah! Oh, oh, right! [Puts Gunter on the counter] My penguin—he's very, very sick. So... what time does your shift end? What kind of guy builds a cave inside of another a cave? [Goes to a book] What's this? A spellbook? [Turns the pedestal] Whoo! Dude! Leave no trace! Ah, it's too late for that. It's not too [Stops the pedestal] ...late. WHOA! What'cha got there? Dude! It's a first-edition Ice Ninja Manual! [reading the manual] A true ninja passes no wind; he only passes... [Jake farts in [in the manual] I ain't even heard of these techniques. [He makes a symbol with his hand] Nuh-nuh-n-numm-nuh [Summons ice nunchucks on his hand.] numb-chucks. Hey. Ice King seems way into ninjas, even more than we are. [Twirling the nunchucks] Yeah, so? [He hits himself with the nunchucks.] So... doesn't that mean that ninjas must be... kinda lame? Nah, they're still cool. But Ice King's still lame because he hides his ninja love. We wear our ninja on our sleeves! [Breaks a cabinet with nunchucks] Jake! Show me how to do that. What's taking that doctor so long? Gunter, make more noise! WUAH! WUAH! Yeah, alright. Don't oversell it, drama queen. Dun, dun, dunnn. Pardon the intrusion. I'm Doctor Princess. Yes, well, uh... [quietly] Come to [Approaching Gunter] Don't worry, sir. I specialize in treating little tuxedo people. Just give it to me straight, doc. Am I gonna have to pay for this? [Puts her stethoscope in Gunter's face] Hmm... [like a heartbeat] Wenk-wenk. Wenk-wenk. Wenk-wenk. Oh, my! What can you do for him, Doctor Princess? [He takes off his crown.] Without Gunter, I'll be all alone. You see, I'm a widower. Oh, I'm sorry. How did your wife die? [Gunter begins to inflate.] Oh, what? Is that what that means? [Puts his crown back on] Whoa, Nelly! Something medical is happening! Gunter, you're embarrassing me! [Making hand positions] Fridjitsu master [Also making hand positions] Fridjitsu master Get ready to be... cold cut! Hyah! [takes two kunai from a case and throws them] Kunai attack! [Kicks icicles] Icicle kick! [Makes hand positions and counterattacks with snow] Force of blizzard! [Evades the snow with a jump] Flying jump! What?! Three Jakes? That's one too many. Caltrop hailstorm! [Summons ice stars and throws them toward the Jakes, which disappear] Those Jakes were all fakes! [Behind Finn] Heh! Fridjitsu master Hiyah! [ [dancing] WOOHOO! YEAH! It's the Ice King! Hide! [hums] Okay, m'dear, this enclosure will be your new home! [To Jake] [whispering] He's got a princess. Now we leap out and catch him red-handed. [He and Jake cover their mouths.] Hai! Snow blind! [Disappears in a flurry of snow] Thin ice, thin ice, thin ice! [Turns 2D and disappears] ...but once you get used to the smell of penguin manure, it's almost tolerable. Ice King, hand over that princess! Princess? What? Jake, where's the princess? Ooh, right. What princess? The, um... princess you were just talking to? Yeah, the one you just came back from stealin'. Wrong-o. I was at the hospital, for it turns out Gunter here was preggers! Wenk. I was just talking to the egg! It's such a cutie! Gunther's a woman?! What? No! [Checks under Gunter, then throws him aside] Fuh. Anyway, get out of my house or I'll kill you, et cetera. I want to take a nap in my easy chair. [suddenly gasps] What happened to my recliner?! Ohh... My skins and tubs! [inhales through his teeth] You even violated my secret sanctum?! What is wrong with you?! No princess? No! No princess! We messed up, Jake. We're... violators! Yeah, what the heck?! You think you can just wreck my house and wear my collectibles?! [He removes their headbands and throws them on the floor] Hah! Who do you guys think you are?! We're... ninjas? You're not ninjas! You're just a couple of jerks! It's true. [Rises] Ice King, we're gonna make this right. Yeah, do it; make it right. And start by, uh... oh, take my bag over to the cage. Oh, no, no, no! Not that! Never mind! Put that down and go clean my gym equipment. Doctor Princess! [Nervously] Oh, heh... I have no idea how that got in there! What's goin' on? I'll field that one. [Cleans her lenses] The Ice King abducted me while I was distracted by the horrifying beauty of birth. Yes, Gunter's ailment was the perfect cover for stealing a princess, M.D. I'm not even a real princess. "Princess" is just a surname. [Jake helps her out of the bag.] Enough! You may have uncovered my princess-smuggling scheme, but you'll never leave this place alive! [laughs] A couple of ninjas like me and Finn can only be defeated by another ninja! Doot, doo, doooo! [summons an ice sansetsukon] Ninja! Ninja! [They cover their mouths and brandish ice weapons.] What am I... looking at here, exactly? NINJA! [They start to fight.] [To Gunter] So... how is your egg doing? Wenk, wenk. Oh. [realizes] Gunter! Why didn't you tell me? [shrugs] [like "I don't know"] Weh-weh-wenk. Oh, Gunter... What the? Why's it so purple outsi— What?! It's too smoky to see... Oh! Something's peeking. Someone's jacking your spaceship! That is my ship! But it looks like it's been modded out. That much engine power, it'll break through the atmosphere before I can do anything to stop it! [Jake's arms stretch up to grab the top of the ship. He gets pulled up, with Finn on his back.] Finn and Jake! Yeah, get that guy! My thorn! [He and Jake look at each other.] I think we should go inside. Oof! [He replaces the door] Gunther! What're you doing?! [turns to face them] What am I doing? A fog shrouds my true intent, even from myself. There! [The ship reaches space, and a comet become visible.] The Catalyst Comet! It all becomes clear. I am more than Gunther. [The brain sticking out of Jake! You okay?! Yeah, man, just don't croak out here. [Orgalorg shifts into a huge yellow being with sharp ends.] Hey, man, look at Gunter. Behold! [opens flaps] I am Whoa. That's pretty. [turns to look at Finn] Looks good, right? Hey. Where's Glob? Uh, I dunno. [shrugs] He exploded in space. Yeah, I thought so. Man, are you still Gunter? 'Cause you seem like you're not. I'm Well, what the heck are you doing, Orgalorg? It was just time to come out again. Glob K.O.'ing himself— [A flashback of Glob from "Astral Plane" is shown] —the arrival of the Catalyst Comet— [the Catalyst Comet is showing hurtling through space] —and a ship to carry me out of this planet's gravity. [the ship from before is shown in its dock] These are doorways the universe presented to me. Ohhh, I know about open door philosophy! What's that? You just say yes to stuff all the time? Pretty much. [touching his helmet] That seems alright. It's all yours if you're willing to take it. Destroy worlds— [folds in on himself briefly] —crush anyone blocking the door. Feel their bones crumple and their goo spill out. I don't like that at all. [pointing to Orgalorg] He made it ugly. You can't stop me; I'm [leaning in and making a fist] I'm pretty sure I can take you, bro. Not after I absorb the power and knowledge of that comet. [lifting his leg] Absorb a triple salchow to your kneecaps! [to Jake] Grab my hand! Okay. Shoot. Hey, stop drifting! I'm not trying to! Ooh, maybe I can use jet propulsion! [passes gas and clutches at his helmet] Oh no, I can't breathe! Jake, no! Don't worry, man, I'm working out a plan! [panicking and looking around] Freakin' bing-bong! Jake's gonna fulfill his croak dream after all! And that dirty umbrella is gonna enslave the universe! [still slowly pushing his way towards the comet] Cram, come on, this is gonna take forever. Man, I'm gonna croak out here! Like a fish in the hands of a child! [hyperventilating and kicking in a panic] [calms and takes a deep breath] Okay, Hey, spaceman. Wha—Dad?! Heh, this is so crazy, Finn! What're you doing out here? Floating to my grave! Hurry up and save me! Can't, buddy— [gesturing to the moth] —this baby does what it wants! Are you kidding me?! No, for real. Look! [looks up at moth] Hey! [whistles and points to Finn] Get that guy there! See? I'm just [shrugs] flying random-style. It's not random! I merged my intention with the universe! You what? [realizes something] Oh! Wait, I have an idea. Really? Here. [holds out underwear] Grab on this. Nah, it's cool, you got gloves on. Oh, yeah. [ You alright? [breathes in] Yeah. Thanks, Dad. [looks into space] Thanks, universe. Come again? [remembering something] Oh! We gotta save Jake. [grabs Martin's face] He's out there chokin' on gas! [moving Finn's hands away] Like I said, I got no control over this beast. [pats Finn's helmet] We're on a journey into mystery, unless I can figure out what this bozo responds to. It's kinda fun, right? See, there's no reason, or purpose, or what you said, uh, "universal intention." [ [scowling] I dunno, there's some stars and stuff. [pokes Finn's helmet] You're squeezed so tight, your bottom's gonna fall out. Put the phone down! [mimes putting a phone down] Put the phone down? Ye— [the moth changes direction abruptly] WHOO! What's going on, huh? [pointing] Look! The light of the comet! Ah! [craning this neck] That's pretty neat. [jabbing his thumb towards the moth] This moth is so bananas, man. Bananas man... bananas man... [spotting Orgalorg] Uh oh, what's that? [still making his way to the comet] Almost there... That dude's gonna absorb the comet's mystical power and crush everybody. Who the heck raises guys like that? You think he had neglectful parents like you, or had he always been a no-good Orgalorg? Oh, gobslops, not Orgalorg! Y-you know him? Yeah, what do you think; I'm a dumb brick?! I don't know Orgalorg? Ahaha, oh, yeah. [The comet flies directly into him, and he begins to absorb it.] Snaps! He ate the comet! I gotta stop him. It's too late, buddy; it's out of our hands. Scronk that! I'm gonna use these hands— [ Aahh! Hey! Dinglord! In the name of— [he throws his arms in the air] the universe— [he points at the comet] stop that! [screaming] [gasps] Grass Sword. [gasps] [shouting nonsense as he continues to whip the tentacle around, slicing Orgalorg open in multiple places] [blowing apart] I didn't open this door! Cool. Finn, do you remember? Yeah, I-I think so. A long time ago— [a flashback of a blue comet hurtling through space is shown] —I was you, sorta. And I crashed on Earth. And became a butterfly or some biz. [a flashback of a butterfly on a leaf is shown] And I guess— [the flashback ends, and we are back to the present] it was just some random, absurd thing. Just a joke I've been playing out for centuries. Who's creating the joke? Are you? And, if so, then are you my creator? Uh—maybe? I dunno. Probably not. Probably not, but who knows? I've been around forever and experienced so much impossible junk. I've embodied all that is good—and evil [we see an image of The Lich on the screen]. And now we're here. It's unprecedented. And I give you a choice. Come with me to end—and the beginning? [the sound of a bell begins to toll] Or struggle here awhile like a beautiful autumn leaf. What's that bell sound? [still inside the moth's mouth] Cool, man. This is your crisis. As you stand on the edge of freedom from Love. Hate. Friendship. Isolation. Jealousy. Secrets. Violence. Video games. Ice cream waffles. Sadness. Madness. Power. Honor. Loyalty. Saucy. Mothers. Fathers. Scoundrels. How long are you gonna list stuff? It's a long list. You're tellin' me to abandon all this stuff— [ It's not bad. I'm just giving you the choice of a new mode of existence. I feel like I put a lot of work into this meat reality. I'd like to see it through. Fair enough. Hey, how 'bout I get a new mode? Are you seriously trying to bail out again?! What? This deal sounds pretty good! [sighs] Dad. Uh oh. I know that look. When you fled the scene like a ding-dong ditcher in the night— Listen, Finn. No answer I give you will be satisfying. Besides, it was, like, 40 years ago. I'm 16! I don't have a star to revolve around to track time. But why do you always run from everything?! [shrugs] You burn enough bridges, the only direction to move is forward. [chuckles] Hmm. Well, there ain't no changin' you, I guess. Well, I'm glad we finally understand each other. [To the comet] Start the engine, comet boy! Prepare to discorporate. Goodbye, son! Bye, Dad. Should've asked for a lift home. JAKE! I thought I had lost...[ You okay, Finn? [looking around] What? [looks up and sees Jake and Banana Man inside Banana Man's rocket] Jake?! Banana Man?! How? Well, I was just floatin' around, and I drifted into B-Man's flight path. Pretty random— [Banana Man nods] —right? It wasn't random; I did it. [with Finn now in the ship as well] Let's get the jazz outta here. No... [as they fall] [penguin noise] [standing on the banks of Lake Butterscotch with Princess Bubblegum, watching the sky] There we go, see? Problem took care of itself! You think Finn and Jake are alright? I'd say it's about a 50/50 chance. That's pretty much everything in life, isn't it? Yeah—Whoa! [points to falling ship and Gunter] What's that? [whose arm is now back to normal as he, Jake, and Banana Man exit the rocket] Hey, PB! We took care of it. [penguin noise] [giving a thumbs up] Good job, guys! [wriggling in Pepbut's hands] Mm, I'm gonna croak out here. [shivers] Brrrr. It's freezing in here. [teleports into his huge pants] Whoa, I'm losing a lot of weight! Calorie control and moderate exercise are the key. But I don't do any of those things, so this is weird. Hmm... My jets are tiny! [covers his jets] No one look at my tiny jets! At least your body is normal, man. My body isn't hot anymore! What's going on, man? I'm scared! Give me a hug, man! I don't know! [hugs the [passes a piece of paper to her older brother] It's as I feared. The magma in the kingdom's core is cooling down, weakening the life force of our Flame Citizens. I've gathered you here to figure out how to stop this. We need ideas, people! [clenches her fists] I'll do my best, sis! Randy, you are here to stay safe only. Eat your snacks. I'll do my best, sis. [eats his snacks] Perhaps everyone can form into a big love hug to stay warm! That's ridiculous, aunt Agnes. I'm not that smart. [slams the table with his fists] Blow up the Candy Kingdom! I've been saying this for months now! And I'll say it again! Let's blow 'em up with their stockpile of you know whats! We've debated this too long! But why the Candy Kingdom? Their sugar burns hotter and faster with lots of extra calories. Don't make me wait, sister! Also, is it safe to talk about in front of the C-I-N-N-A-M-O-N B-U-N? [tries to pick something in his nose] Cinnamon Bun, what are you doing? My nose itches! You don't have a nose. What? [continues picking his nose] Well, whatever it is, it won't go away if you don't stop fiddling with it. [continues to slam his fists on the table] Blow up the Candy Kingdom! They are trash people! I'm prepared to do what I need to as a leader. Nothing is off the table, but we need Princess Bubblegum as an ally right now. She might be able to help us solve this. Very well. Randy, send them an ultimatum! Help us or die! [becomes enraged and slams his fist on the table]  [gasps] Princess! [grabs Flame Princess before one of the cool air pockets hits her] Yeah, pump those legs, Randy! Quickly, CB, take me to the core entrance. Okay! Hello, Bubblegum. Thank you for coming. [bows slightly] I'm glad you sent for me, and please, call me Bonnibel! Hey, what's your first—? Don't act like you're my friend, PB! You're here to help save my kingdom, not because I trust you. [opens her Mondometer and follows Flame Princess] We're in the midst of unnatural cold season, but the cause has us stumped. [looks down] My people are really freaking out. Yeah, my subjects tend to panic in crisis situations, too. [puts her hand on Flame Princess' shoulder] It's tough; a ruler's got to deal with a lot of subservient dummies. Hmmm... Whoa! Whoa! Hold up. My Mondometer is going cuckoo. [uses her Mondometer to scan the doors in front of them and points to it] Where does this lead? Behind these doors are the most secret relics in the Fire Kingdom. Forbidden to outsiders. Come on. Well, whatever is back there is kicking out mondo energy levels. It could have something to do with the cooling. Do you wanna save your kingdom or not? Alright, but don't touch anything! [uses her fire powers to unlock the doors and opens it, revealing the giants inside the room ] These are the sleeping Fire Giants. They're the ancient protectors of the Fire Kingdom. Their existence is known only to those of the royal line, and their story has been passed down through the generations. [walks near one of the fire giants] With them, I can remake a white-hot new Fire Kingdom. They are our last resort, our greatest weapons. Huh? [sees Princess Bubblegum stealing the unit of the giant] Hey! I said "no touching"! What? Oh, no no no! This little geothermic control module, or whatever it is, accidentally fell out. [puts the unit back] I was just putting it back! Huh, strange. The access panel's lock must have corroded. [scoffs] Yeah, ancient technology's always falling apart. [opens up her Mondometer] Oh! The readings are over here now! [as she walks to the other way, she accidentally rips her bag, spilling the stolen units.] What?! [sighs] Okay, let me explain. These bad boys are just too dangerous to remain functional, and I can't risk you or your bananas brother using them, especially now that you've lost most of your powers. [bends down to reach the stolen units] So let me just finish disarming... [shoots a fire ball at Princess Bubblegum] You are way out of line, Bubblegum! You have no control here! [turns into giant form and flies up] I do! [throws two fireballs at Princess Bubblegum] [dodges her attacks] Aah! Shield, shield! [her fire proof suit activates a shield on her and Flame Princess' next attack gets reflected from her shield, leading it to destroy one of the nearby giants.] Nooooo! [smiles] Hey, nice shot! Ya ding dong! [growls and shoots a fireball at Princess Bubblegum] Cloak. [disappears] Come out in the open and face me like a princess! [appears near one of the fire giants] The Fire Kingdom has always been a threat to my realm! [sends a cloud seeding missile towards Flame Princess as an attack] So that gives you the right [twists herself around the missile to avoid it] to donk up my people's future?! [flies towards Princess Bubblegum. She cloaks herself and escapes, leading And I can't leave my people's safety to chance! [releases another one of her missiles to attack Flame Princess] [dodges her attack] Why can't you just trust me?! [throws a huge fireball towards Princess Bubblegum] [sighs and jumps out of the way to dodge Flame Princess' attack] 'Cause you're a ding dong. I've got to do whatever it takes to protect my peeps. [heads towards the entrance to the room and cloaks herself] So be it. [releases two large fire blades and turns into her enraged but smaller form] [moans in pain] [flies in front of Princess Bubblegum] You're never going to change, are you? You'll just keep walking all over us little people! [shoves a fireball in front of Princess Bubblegum] But not today. [pants] Shields off. [her shield disables, causing her to fall from the wall and the two princesses pant as they lie on the ground.] Okay, I'll come clean. Yeah, right. It was me. I messed with the core temperature to get in here. I had to get near your weapon stockpile. But how did you find out about them? Ummm... Wait... [pulls out a video camera out of his nose] Wow, my nose is disgusting! You're still spying on me? I'm PB! I spy on everybody. No big D! You're cold, PB! Eh. [shrugs] And it's not because you're a scientist or leader; it's because you are a bad person! Something inside you is messed up, girl. And whatever it is, [sighs] whatever, whatever, PB! Okay, keep one last fire giant. I'm not a bad person. I want you to see that. I promise. You better not be fibbing. [helps Princess Bubblegum up] It's Phoebe. My first name is Phoebe. You, uh, asked earlier. Ice King, call it off. Roger that, Princess. [stops freezing a lava lake] My jets! Yes! [expands and turns back into his normal state] Oh no! I was gonna blow up stuff! It was going to be cool! Hmmm... [puts her hand on the camera's wire and sighs] We were going to war! [Flame Princess then puts her hand on her brother's shoulder.]  This stinks! Hey, how much longer till we get to the mysterious party? Let me check the spooky invite sent to us by our anonymous host. [Takes letter out from his jacket] Oh. We're here. The party's in that castle. It's for us! What's it say? [Reading card] Wear me. Wear me? [Jake opens the box and they both whistle.] Hello? Yoo-hoo! [Camera pans to the left to show Princess Bubblegum, is that you? Why yes indeed. Although according to the invitation, we're supposed to use mystery names. And mine is Lady Quietbottom. My name is Duchess Gummybuns. I am Professor Pants. I'm What's the name on your invite? Oh yeah! Uh... It's Guy Farting. Prince Hotbod, at your service. [Bows] I'm Randy Butternubs. [Walks away and throws card on ground] So... who's our host, anyway? Nobody knows! Maybe he'll be a steaming hot babe with huge money. Tut-tut, Lumpy Space Princess! What would your boyfriend Brad say? Brad and I broke up a long time ago, duh! Now's my chance! No. Way. But I can make you happy! [Smacks his hand away] Puke off! [Slaps him in the face] You big donut! Okay. [Gets off couch and walks over to a painting, revealing an envelope taped to his back] Excuse me, Guy Farting, there's an envelope on your back. [Struggling to reach it] Where? Where? Here. Let me. [Walks over and takes it off him] [To everyone] Did you put that enevlope on him? No. No. I didn't do it, no. No. Uh-Uh. What's it say, Prince Hotbod? [Clears throat and reads note] Esteemed guests, I am your host. I am a ghost. By the time you finish reading this, I will posses one of you and use your body to murder everyone in the house. We gotta get out of here! [Runs to the door.] CB, wait! It says anyone who will try to leave will die! Nonononononono! [Pulls door handle] He's DEAD!!! Yeaaaaah, right. Whad'ya mean "Yeaaaah, right"? [Walks over to Cinnamon Bun's skeleton] Come on. You don't remember when I pulled the same trick on your birthday? [Picks up Cinnamon Bun's skull.] I used the fake skeletons. [Makes Cinnamon Bun's mouth move the same time he is speaking.] To make you think everyone was dead. It looks real to me. [Blows small raspberry] Classic move. Dude. [He pushes up his mask and crosses an arm across chest] I swear I'm not pranking you. Cinnamon Bun is dead. The question is who killed him? One of us is possessed by a murderer. And if we want to stay alive, we have to figure out who's hiding a ghost inside their mortal body. BMO! [Points down at BMO] Ahh! Use your ghost detecting equipment to screen everyone. I blinked by balls. My eye balls. Hmmm... [Narrows eyes suspiciously.] What do you mean "Hmmm?" Nothing... Did you see that? [Whispers indistinctly] [Whispers indistinctly] Oh it was Jake I knew it, I knew it was Jake. Processing... Data! [Prints pictures from its bottom.] Ew. Huh? So who's the ghost, BMO? Oh. Um... I don't have a ghost detecting equipment. [Slides photos inside of him.] I just like taking nice pictures. Let's find some candles. If the lights go out again, we'll be able to catch the murderer! Good idea! Jake and BMO, you check downstairs and we'll take this floor. Okay. Lay truth on me BMO, is Finn pulling some elaborate prank on me? No, Jake. When bad things happen, I know you want to believe they are a joke. [Its light goes out.] But sometimes, life is scary, and dark. That is why we must find the light. Aha! [ Ooh! [Laughs maniacally.] Thanks, BMO! BMO? Help! Jake help! BMO? AHHH! [Runs back up the stairs to the foyer.] Oh my crease! Oh my crease! Assemble! Reassemble! Come on you guys! Where's BMO? The ghost got 'im! Don't you mean you got 'im- [Picks up Princess Bubblegum and throws her from the upstairs balcony, onto a couch on the first floor. Princess Bubblegum rolls off the couch and Guys, if there really is a ghost killer, then we should stay in a group. He can't take us all on if we're in a group! LSP, are you okay? Where are you? [worried] It sounds like she's in there! [Points to a door behind them.] I'm DYING! [of relief] Ahhh! Ugh, gross. My lumping body's all hollow now, I gotta put something in it. So where's the food? What kind of castle is this? It's like a poor people's castle! With no lumping waffles for my dump truck! [Picks up belly and drops it on the table.] Chill out, girl. [to Finn] You find any candles upstairs? No. Well, I dropped a lighter downstairs, but there's no way I'm going back for that. Uh-huh. [He pulls out the invitation.] Let me remind y'all that the invite says that the ghost will possess one of our bods. [offscreen] Not my bod. Someone at this table isn't who they appear to be! [suspicious] That's right, [finger quotes] "Jake." So let me ask you a question only the real Jake could answer. Who is always next to me in my recurring elevator dreams? [matter-of-factly] A half-orc shaman. [convinced] Okay, you're Jake. So, who else was absent when BMO got nabbed? Oh yeah, right! I'm not the ghost! I was in the potty house. A convenient alibi. But tell me this... [interrupting] Why did you break up with Brad? Only the real LSP would know that! Shah! As if you even know the answer to that, Jake! You're right. I'm just feeling gossipy and I wanna know what happened. IT'S NONE OF YOUR LUMPING BUSINESS! Sounds suspicious. [pointing at Lumpy Space Princess] I bet you're the ghost! She did it! She's possessed! Tie her up! Oh she is, huh? Well, before we tie up LSP, answer me this... [interrupting] Brad, he kissed me on the mouth! And I was like 'bleh-bleh-bleh', and then I was like 'Uh, gross. Go away, Brad' and he was like 'obviously you're not ready for me' but what does that even mean you guys? W-What does it lumping mean? [ [After a short awkward silence; continuing to Princess Bubblegum] But answer me this, Princess... [interrupting again] What do you want from me, Brad?! You said I was the hottest one, isn't that enough?! [Nearly gibberish] Why'd you have to ...my mouth! [ [After another pause; to Princess Bubblegum] What did I write to you on your Happy Birthday card two years ago? Word for word. [flatly] Finn, there's no way I would remember that... [hurt] I remember that. [Pulls down mask] [accusing] You're not PB! Tie you up! [shocked] What! Wait you guys! [Jake stretches his arms around [surprised] A real ghost?! [scared] Aah! Don't touch me! Don't touch ME! DAAAAAG! [breaking up] This wasn't supposed to... ha-a-appen! Aha! [taps Finn's face] I knew you were pranking me back, you! Yeah... it was all a set up. The doors, Cinnamon Bun's and BMO's. Oh strizz! BMO and Cinnamon Bun should be in the closet over there. [ [shrieking] OH MY GLOB! I can't take this, you guys. [she pulls out her cellphone] I'm calling my lumping parents right now! LSP! What's happening! Where'd did she GO?! [turning and noticing the painting] Look! [Finn walks over.] [whispering] I'm scared, bro. RUN, HOMIE, RUN! Open it! It won't open! [He taps the door with his left hand, enlarges his right and punches the door. He then holds his hand in pain.] [getting up and running up the stairs] C'mon! [groggily] Okay... Jake! [hopping in pain] Ow, ow, ow! I got a splinter! Jakey! Don't let go, man! Oh no! Your fancy GLOVES! [breathing heavily] Jake... Princess! [shrieking] YEEAAARGH! [removing the white sheet covering him sitting on Lady Rainicorn 's head.] Haha! Gotcha, dude! Two for two! WHAT!? I figured out your plan months ago! So I flipped the script. Oh yeah! So everyone's okay. [counting on fingers] BMO, Cinnamon Bun... Yeah, see?! Whoa, sick! You can phase people into your body?! 당연하지! 난 제이크랑 항상 한 몸이 되는데. ("Of course. Jake and I merge our bodies all the time.") [whispering] I'm ready for you now, Brad. Isn't it so obvi? I'm so ready. [to Princess Bubblegum] But, PB. You melted! It was a wax dummy, dummy! Jake switched me out while Lady was distracting you. [awed] Wow, you got me again! I can't believe that! With the hair, and the house coming alive and stuff... The what? The walls and chairs trying to eat me and stuff. Eh, nah. You must have been so scared you imagined that part. [adamant] Uh, no I didn't... Haha, nice try, Finn. Let's get outta here. That one's going in the vault. [he puts a hand to his head] Aaaaand... It's gone. Oh, geez. Oh, geez. Ugh, come on. Uh... Come on. Come on. Finn, don't worry about it. We've got bigger fish to fry right now. But... It's fine. Pep-but used to love being scattered all around. He used to tell me that. Lies! [turns on levitating couch] Those farmers won't keep this thing busy for long. [climbs on couch] So it's up to the four of us to stop him. Are you ready, Marceline? Marceline? Hey, what's wrong? [sighs] Me, I guess. What? Me. I'm wrong. This—all of this—this is all my fault. Even just fighting the vampires in the first place screwed everything up. Sure screwed me up, anyway. And, geez Louise, trying to fix it—trying to fix me... Just made things a thousand times worse. So why even try, you know? What's the point? What? Marceline, no. Come on! We're always the underdogs, you and me, and we always pull through. Like that one time, you remember? The case of the purloined egg? No! I told you, that's it. I'm done. All right people, this is our last stand! It's gonna take every one of us to see this thing through—me, Onion Man, Short Man, Terry—[Bubblegum flies overhead] whoa!—Short-Stack, Good-Beard, DeShawn, Seedman, Sandwich Paul, Angry Susan... Muy Linda, Dr. Belstar... [inside cloud] Help! ...Limbo Man, Quasar, Dogman, Tightwad, Raspberry Sam... Up here! ...DJ Fresh-Start, and my boy Big Trace. You sure you're not coming, Marceline? We could really use your help. Marceline? Okay, maybe later then. Come on, Finn! Let me hear that war cry! [looking up at cloud monster] Well, you finally did it, big guy. You won. Well played. I just kind of wish you would gotten it over with a thousand years ago and saved us all some trouble. Better late than never, I guess. [sighs] You remembered my song! [chuckles] Simon? W-what are you doing here? Well, I saw through my peeping scope that everything was going boom and exploding and monsters, and all my friends were in grave danger and horrible torment. And you wanted to help? No! I felt left out. I'm just a phone call away, you know. [hugs him] I'm sorry, Simon. Next time, for sure. [sighs] Anyway, you don't want in on this fight. This one's a loser. Oh, I see. Sittin' this one out, huh? Yeah, I guess. And don't try to talk me out of it. What? No, no, I'm right there with you. You and me—we're survivors, right? Like cockroaches or rats. Sure, you could fight and try to save the day, but what if you lose? Then what? You could die. Better to rot and hide like a rat, right, buddy? [hugs Marceline] Ugh! [pushes Ice King away] Did you just call me a cockroach, Simon?! What? No! No, no, no, no. Thanks, buddy. Yes. Ahh, this is nice. Getting a little warm for royal fineries, though. [disrobes] Mm-hmm! Princess? It sounds pretty bad out there. Perhaps you should protect your people. Yeesh, it does sound bad! Hey, banana men, listen to your princess! In my kingdom, we look after our own—me! You look after me! Close the gates! S-she's beautiful. You're preachin' to the preacher, brother. I'm beautiful! Close the gate! No. You're not beautiful. [takes off wig] We see you clearly now. You're earwax! You're earwax! Aah! Huh?! And the power returns to Aah! But you love m-e-e-e-e! [melts] And instead of a wax idol, they shall have a true princess... Wrought of iron, with teeth of diamonds. Her heart is ice! Her will is fire! Princess Whoa! Finn, this ain't workin'. It's just fart grabbin'. Yeah, but what else can we do? [sighs] Dudes, I don't know. Look! [gasps] [Marceline zips past him] Whoa! [grunts] I'm gonna poop my pants if Finn kills this guy instead of me! Wha?! King? Vampire king? You still in here? Hello? Too bad. Oh, boy! Ooh, I am famished! The beast weakens! Whoa-ho-ho. Whoa! [gasps] Marceline? Marceline? Sorry, what? I was just saying we stocked your fridge with lipstick and stuff, so you'll have lots to eat. Aww, thanks, dude. Also, we got you crosswords, "sudukus," and connect-the-dots. Just take her easy, buddy. Sure. Oh, hey, I was thinking—so, once I usurp Crunchy, I'll have my castle back again, and there's plenty of room there if you don't want to be alone. No, I think I need to ruminate a little—think about being a vampire again. Are you, uh... Do you feel bad? I don't want to say, like, "I'm sorry about who you are" or anything if you're feeling okay, but I don't know how bad news all of this is... Right? Nah, I'm cool being a vampire again. Being mortal was good... At the same time, it was terrifying. Now I'm a vampire with fresh mortal memories and—I don't know—more empathy or something... More grown-up. Bonnie, thank you for helping me grow up. Now, I guess we get to hang out together forever. Take care! See ya, Marcy! Later, Vampire Queen! Your friends seem nice. Um... Are you, like, in my head now, or what? For now. Well, just don't get in my wa— [Sighs.] 나 정말 TV 걱정되네. 쟤는 밖에 절대 안 나가잖아. (I'm really worried about T.V. You know, he never leaves home.) Aw, don't worry about him. It's good to be passionate about your hobbies. 으유, 몰라, 난 싫어. 쟨 밖에 나가서 찬 공기 좀 쐬야 돼. (Ugh, I don't know, I don't like it. He really needs some fresh air.) Yo, T.V.! Get me a chocolate bar! Okay. Attaboy! Ah! Hello, young man! [Disappointed,] Oh. Psych. Delicious chocolate bridge... Yeuch. Huh? [Reading,] This diary belongs to B.P. Private property. [Turns the page.] If you're stilling reading this, you're a bad person. [Stops reading.] Uh... statute of limitations. Dear diary. Wow. I sound like a real cornball. Oh, well. Dear diary! Mom is going to love you. She's always ragging about me spending too much time with my nose in books. I wonder what I'm going to write in you. What kind of person will I be when I get to your last page? Will I have my braces off? Will I have written a song that doesn't totally suck? Will I have met a cool guy? ...I can barely look at dudes without breaking out into hives. ...Just another day in teenage purgatory, AKA the school caf. Sloppy joes again. ...Boys I did not talk to today Brownie Guy... Geez, B.P... Prone to dramatics much? The Fire Kingdom has officially frozen over. Justin Rockcandy asked me to the semi-formal! Oh my Glob. Justin... Justin is taking me to the Fructose Fair... Justin... Justin wants to go on the rollercoaster... Kissing is fun and easy, if I don't think about the bacteria in spit teeming, multiplying... Diary, can you keep a secret? ...Justin! ...Justin... Hive of bees in my head, get out! ...Mother, I'm not going to tell you again! ...Lies, lies, lies! ...Diary, it's my birthday tomorrow, but I don't feel like celebrating. I feel like screaming. [Gasps.] Tell him what? [Puts the book down.] Uuuuuugh! TV! 아침밥!(Breakfast!) Not hungs. [Grabs an apple from a bowl on the counter.] Heading out for a bit. 쟤좀봐! (Look at him!) [Preparing to eat,] There you go, just need a little push from the old man. [Coughs.] I gotta get into the mind of this kid. [Opens the diary.] Roleplay. Rip, rip! [Pretends to throw the diary.] Ahh! Sploosh! My secret is safe at the bottom of this disgusting moat. [As Justin] Oh, B.P., what have you done? [As B.P.] I'm sick of the lies. Sick, sick, sick! [As Justin] Uh, babe, I said I'm sorry? [As B.P.] You don't know me. Nobody knows me, leave me alone! I hate Sloppy Joes! Yuck. Taffi? Mochi! Hey Moch'! Is that the new Nosy Nellies bootleg 7-inch? [Barely audible,] Taffi, Mochi, down here! I ordered it from this dude in Lumpy Space. Is it insane? It's almost too insane. Wicked. Hiya B.P.! What's up? Justin? Guilty as charged. [He picks T.V. up by his backpack and sets him in his other hand.] You psyched for your birthday, birthday girl? Don't forget about our little rendezvous at Love Tree Point, huh? I can't wait for you to see your prezzie. You're gonna be there, right? Please say yes! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Bam! [Slaps down three more cards.] Bam! [Slaps down the remaining four.] Bam! Lady, you're really off your game. I never win at canasta! TV 가 걱정되서. 얘가 하루 종일 밖에 나가 있잖아. (I'm worried about T.V. He's been out all day.) You said you wanted the kid to spend more time outside. Bam--He's outside. He's loving it! 너무 어두워지네. 가서 애 뭐 하나 좀 봐. (It's getting too dark. Go see what he's doing.) If it'll make you feel better then yes, but I'm sure he's fine. Uh-oh. Uh, son? Mom? Uh, close enough. Get out of my room! T.V., what is that? [Gets to his feet.] Private property. Gimme the book. [He pulls it away from T.V. with some effort.] Noooooo! [Opens the book.] A diary, huh? Juicy. [Flips through the pages.] And now you've become dangerously obsessed with it, and have confused your reality with that of the diary keeper. [Turns to T.V., who looks at the book over Ooh, ripped pages! Mystery. And look how the handwriting changes right before the rip! [He points.] The e's are all crabbed. That's weird, right? That's super weird, son. She was obviously emotionally distraught. Maybe she was so stressed she broke out in hives! And they covered her whole body. So they rushed her to the hospital. She was thinking, "oh man I'm so young," and how life is so unfair, and that this was the end. But it wasn't the end. She had pulled through. Except her hand had been replaced with a crab hand! Which negatively affected her handwriting. Yeah! And, and, while I recovered, I refused all visitors. Wait... you refused? Especially Justin. [Night falls, and a nurse turns on a lamp.] How could he love a girl with a crab hand? I mean... that is definitely not normal. Justin sent me flowers every day for a week. Then every other day. Then they stopped coming all together. On my birthday I decided I was going to keep my promise to meet Justin, crab hand or no crab hand. But when I got to Love Tree Point, Justing was already there... ...Making out with my BFFs Taffi and Mochi! [Shocked,] He did not! [Opens the diary.] Well, that's one theory, anyway. Am I unlovable? Hey, did you say Love Tree Point? That's where the kids used to go smoochin' back in the day. This diary must be pretty old. We should go check it out. Ugh, this place is a dump. [Looking around,] Why do they call this Love Tree Point? Because of that tree over there. Yeah, it's pretty heavy-handed. [Holds the diary to his chest.] On page 42 it says Justin hid a present somewhere around here. Maybe it's in the tree. Hey, good thinking! Bingo! It's so beautiful... Yeah... B.P. would have love this. Justin must have been too devastated to reclaim it. Maybe he thinks she'll come back for it one day. [He twists to look out over the water.] [Sniffles.] We've got to find her, Dad! She never knew how much she meant to him. To all of us! 어으, 놀고들 있네. (Ugh, playing around.) Y'know, son, I bet I know where this music box is from. Maybe they can give us a clue. Oh, yes. Yes, this is one of mine. From my "dancing cat" period. [He opens the box.] Do you remember who bought it? Oh, goodness. [He holds the box up in front of him.] It feels like a lifetime ago. I must have made hundreds of boxes since then, each marrying sound and motion to tell a unique story... The dance of the cosmos in miniature. Okay...Well, we gotta go. [Suddenly,] A young man bought this! Justin! Was he handsome? Oh, very. Who was it meant for? A girl. Betsy. [Gasps.] B.P.! She ran away. Went wild, cut herself off from the world, hid away in a cave never to be seen again. [He closes the music box.] Woah. But Dad, there are probably hundreds of caves in-- It's the one at the fork in the road to Butterscotch Lake! The box said she does weird stuff to bodies up there. That's it! Why do you think Betsy ran away, Dad? Hard to say. [He changes slowly back to his normal shape as he walks.] Some people can't face their troubles. But T.V., hiding away won't solve anything. Look! Ah, teachable moment. Betsy? Betsy? Betsy... Oh my Glob. We're too late! She was too good for this cruel world. [Sobs.] It's a model. Huh? It's plastic. [Waving the skeleton's hand,] "Heeyyy." Hey, look at this! Maybe we shouldn't read this... Yes, we should. Dear Justin I'm not sure you'll ever read this letter. Maybe I'm writing this more for myself anyway. You know when you're little, and the future feels really far away? You don't know what it looks like. You just hope you'll have stuff figured out by then. You'll know exactly how to act, and feel. You'll have conquered all your fears. And you'll never feel dumb or uncomfortable. You don't think about how you'll actually get there. The middle parts, between now and then? The middle parts suck. Which is why I split, I guess. Okay, so riding out your teen years in a cave is pretty dramatic, but do you know much reading you get done in a cave? I even figured out a cure for my crab hand! Oh Justin, I hope you're not too upset, and I hope you didn't spend too much money on that birthday present. It wouldn't have worked out between us anyway. You're kind of clingy. Sincerely, Nurse Betsy Poundcake. Nurse Poundcake! [Holding a syringe,] I've got the injection, doctor. [Shaking his head,] I'm not gonna  make it, man! Gah! You will live! Way to take control of the situation, nurse. Save it for the post-op, Doc. Wow. B.P. is Nurse Poundcake. She turned out fine! But what about the ripped pages? Oh, I saw them in the cabin. It was just a lot of mean stuff about Justin. [Chuckling,] Hey, that guy must be pretty sad, huh? Hey, you wanna go find him? No. Here, try throwing this one. [ Throw it! Yeah, go on, get out of here! [An unknown figure runs away from What the heck is goin' on? I have no idea. But it's probably best to stay out of it. Yeah. Hey, look. [ Uh-oh... [yells] Duke of Nuts! [ Oh... [runs away] Oh no! She thinks that nuts guy did it. We gotta go clear up what happened! Don't worry, my dear. I'll have you fixed up in no time! Princess! [ Yeah, I guess if green and bald is okay. [while laughing] Oh boy. I'm sorry! I can't stop now. My dear, not to worry! The medicine milk in this suit will have you healed lickety-split! In just five days you'll be back to your beautiful bubblegummy self. [yells] Five days?! The Grand Meeting of Ooo Royalty is tonight! [ Uh... hey, Princess. There's something I should tell you about that bottle that hit you in the face. I already know, Finn! The Duke of Nuts has always been a bad guy. But now that he's done this, I'll never forgive him! And it's not just because I hate the Duke! I'd never forgive anybody who did this to me! I'd hate them! Yeah but- FOREVER! Forever?! Finally. I have a witness to his misdeeds! Two witnesses! Jake! Oh Finn, my flawless, flawless champion, bring the Duke of Nuts to justice. The justice of a cold dungeon! [ Heheh. She's completely bonkers. What do I do? If I tell her I threw it, she'll hate me forever! Don't worry! [elbows Finn lightly] That won't happen. We're gonna catch that Duke! But we're the ones who threw the bottle! Dude, look. The Duke of Nuts is bad guys. How do you know that? Think about it. If Bubblegum hates him so much, then he must have done some rotten stuff. I mean, maybe he even threw a bottle and turned someone ugly before. Maybe you're right. Maybe I am! Alright, just this once, we'll be vigilantes! Nah, we're more like cops. Crooked cops! [ Princess! I won't rest until the villainous duke is captured! [with a creepy smile] Oh, thank you, Finn! [laughs maniacally.] Woah. Okay, and by then, hopefully you'll have taken care of...this. [moves hand over face] Look yonder! The Duke of Nuts castle! Duke of Nuts! How are you? By order of Princess... [hesitantly] Um, Princess... [The Duchess of Nuts turns her head around 180 degrees to face Hello, Finn. Are you here to arrest the Duke? How did you know? [grabbing a bowl of nuts] The nuts told me...for I am the [ I know of my husband's crime against the princess. A crime that you personally witnessed! And why would you lie? Huh? Yeah, why? Oh but he was once such a wonderful man! He'd pet dogs, kissed babies; we'd lie together underneath the cashew bush. He even taught under-privileged nuts how to dance. But somehow he's gone rancid! These nuts tell me he must be executed. Would you like to hear what my nuts have to say?! That won't be...um...necessary. Listen! Listen! Woah! I don't get it, Jake. How can the dude be evil if he pets puppies, kisses babies, and lies with his wife? What?! You believe that? She is nuts. Listen, man. Let's just go back and face the music. Who cares if Bubblegum hates you forever? It's no biggie. Tons of people hate me! Why, Jake? Why won't you print my letters? I...I...I HATE YOU! Hmm. [gasps] [A figure runs past [while running] I'll break left! You take the right! [They both go in their direction. I went left too! Wha-? [ Dude. That's not him. No one will harm the Duke of Nuts! I will kill whoever seeks to arrest him! No! Please! This has gone far enough! That's the Duke of Nuts. But I vowed to kill whoever did this to you. They can't take you away, Dad! [cries] Who's the toughest little nut? That's you. [Marquis of Nuts continues to cry into the Man, I don't know, Jake. Why would Princess Bubblegum hate him if he's such a nice guy? Just because he's a good father, doesn't necessarily mean he isn't a villain. That doesn't look like a villain. I can probably think of a reason why that's villainous if you gave me enough time. Maybe. Ugh! Maybe we should just confess. But then, Princess Bubblegum will hate us forever. Hey man, it's not that bad being hated. C'mon man, pick it up! You son of a bleeblop! Oh! Sorry to make you wait. I made these daisy crowns for you guys as a- as a token of gratitude for waiting. [Finn and Jake put the crowns on.] Oh...sorry I....I have to sit down for a second. I know this is an odd question, but you wouldn't happen to have any pudding on you, would you? Actually yeah, I think I have one in my pack. Oh, thank goodness. I think I have a spoon in here too- wha-? What happened to the cup? Oh, I'm so embarrassed! Now you know my shame. I can't stop eating pudding. What?! I don't tell people because I hate making them worry, but yes, I have a rare condition. A pudding deficiency. And I always end up eating all of the royal pudding supply whenever I go to the castle. So that's why Princess Bubblegum hates you! Yes, but I didn't turn Princess Bubblegum green and bald! I would never do such a thing! Gah! Of course you wouldn't! You're too nice a guy. I'm the one who threw that bottle. I was gonna tell her, but then-- she started talking all crazy-- she said she'd never forgive me and I-- I didn't know! Hey, it's okay. People make mistakes. It's all part of growing up and you never truly stop growing. Now you're making me feel even worse by being so nice about it. Maybe I should just confess the crime and end all of this. Wait...I think I might have an idea that will save everyone's reputations. Halt! Finn! Did you find the duke yet? Not yet, but you are in grave danger, Princess. There is an assassin in these very woods, dead set on stopping you from reaching the Grand Meeting. In fact, what's that rustling in the bush?? [behind bush while shaking the bush] Rustle. Rustle, rustle. [ What's going on?! Oh, [out of character] Did I come out to early? [coughs] What are you here to do, stranger? I've come for the princess. I'm an assassin! Um, guys? Stand back! I will stop him! Hi-yah! Hi-yah! I will kill you! And raise your children as my own! Hi-yaah! Hah! Remember, it's just acting, Jake! [while running towards Princess Bubblegum] Sorry, dude! [ [behind bush] I don't know if I can do this. Go, go, go, go! And that's how I, the [jumping out of bush] Yeah, alright! [while still on ground from the impact of rock] Yeah! What was the point of this little play again? [gasps] And why isn't the duke clapped in irons?! She's right. Innocent or not, I should accept what's coming to me. Peppermint Butler! [Peppermint Butler comes out of the shadows with golden handcuffs. He starts to walk towards the Duke of Nuts.] Oh, no! Nuttin's going my way today. No! Finn? The duke didn't throw that bottle! Ahh- Princess, I have something sucky to confess. I'm the one who threw the bottle. [Princess Bubblegum gasps.] I'm sorry, but I knew if I told you, you'd hate me forever! Hmm...well, I could never stay mad at you forever. And you seem genuinely penitent. I don't even know what that means, but thank you! [points at them] But that doesn't douse my hatred for the duke! Yeah, what's up with that hate? That jerk always empties out my pudding pantry! Aw, shucks. He just can't control himself around pudding. He goes cocoa-nuts for it! Because he has a pudding deficiency! It's true, your majesty. I'm sorry for my medical condition. Oh, my, you poor man! Of course you're forgiven! [whispering to Finn] Yeah, I don't believe a word from him. [sighs] I'm really sorry about making you temporarily ugly, Princess. Especially before the Grand Meeting of Ooo Royalty. I wish there was some way to make it up to you. Maybe there is, Finn. Maybe there is... hey! [Princess catches Finn and Jake walking away.] [turning around] Hmm, what? You said maybe. [while hitting gavel on podium] Call to order the sesquicentennial Grand Meeting of Ooo Royalty. I now call upon the delegate from the Candy Kingdom. Princess Bubblegums? Ahem! It would be presumptuous indeed to present myself against the distinguished princess to whom you have listened. [yawning and talking to an oval-shaped member of royalty] Buy a lady a drink? [gasps] The Marquis of Nuts?! Yes, but I didn't come alone! Remember me, Jake?! ...nope. Una—[snorts] unacceptable. Mm... un-unacceptable. Unaccepta—aah! [wakes up] Lemons! Whew! Mm. Gunter? Y-you having a bad dream? Gunter? Oh, my Glob. [breathes heavily] Hello, Simon. [screams] Oh, lady! Hi. Wait, you don't remember me? Oh, man. I'm so sorry. I stalk a lot of ladies. Were you at Shelby's barbecue? Huh. Looks like you've lost it all the way. You've crossed the valley of tears and come out the other side but a shadow. Oh, thanks. Well, all the better for you to... [leans in] submit. I like where this is going. Don't resist. Sell your spirit to the skies. Surrender to The Empress, my darling! My great eternal love! How can I serve you? [slaps Ice King's hands away] Bring me blood. At once! [jumps out of bed] Alley-oop! [scoops up an armful of penguins] [tosses hand aside] Wenk-wenk! [reading Ice King's diary and laughing] Oh, this is so sad. Here you go, my love. What's this? Don't you have any human? Humans? Well, Finn's the only human around here. Try a penguin. [squeezes it] Wenk! Ugh. [takes it] You know, Empress is a kind of penguin, and your name is Empress. That's kind of cool, right? [bites penguin, then immediately tosses it aside] Bleh. Tastes like cheese water. Where's the top-drawer stuff? Oh, uh, don't be like that, Honey-poo. I'll fix it. I'll do anything for you. Bring me the blood of Finn! Okay. Oh, look. I've gotten to my bit. "Today I met a super-pretty cyclops lady with fangs. She told me to eat a fat boulder, and I did it." Ha! I'd forgotten that one. The Empress! Vampiyah, I'm gonna kick yah Vampiyah, I'm gonna lick yah Vampiyah Aah! Uh-oh. It's P.B.'s outside clock! Ahh. You did a tremendous job guarding the cabin, Jake. But it looks like you need to be relieved. Yeah, I need relief. P.B. still working on new vampire-busting gear? Yeah, but she's almost done. No sign of Marceline, though. I think she ditched us to fight the vampires by herself. Solo-style. We'll go look for her after P.B.'s device is up and running. So, how did you pass the time? Patted my laps and made some rhymes. Stoop, stoop, sittin' on the stoop Stoop, stoop, sittin' on the stoop Is that P.B.'s outside clock? Looks like it's been staked. What did you do? I heard a loud snap, and my vampire-hunting reflexes kicked in! Dude, that was her Uncle Gumbald's outside clock. Yeeegh! She doesn't have to know I broke the clock. Let's blame it on the vampires! Or we can hide it! Whoo! Problem solved? Yeah? Whooop! Snap! Aaah! What was that?! Vampiyah! Aah! Aah! Hyah! Hah! Snap, snap, snapping branches for fun Oh, ho, ho, this is riveting. "The Hey! Who's my hunny bunny?! Simon! Marceline! What has she done to you? Did she bite you?! Hey, calm down. You're destroying the mood. I'm trying to get her to bite me later. Minion! Honestly, I'm standing right here as you collude against me with my sworn enemy. It's a bit rude. Sorry. Eh! Stake! Yeah! Finn? I got your back, Marceline! Ha! Huh? Ow. How dare you stake my back? I was aiming for your heart! Ice King, bind the interlopers in ice. Heh. Let's keep it down, huh? My baby's resting. Aaaaaah! No way! Waaaaaaah! Shush! Simon, you have to resist the Empress! But she's a woman. Aha! Ohh. She's a vampire! I hunt vampires because of you! Because of me? [Sings "Remembering Memories"] Staking vampires, protecting the last remaining humans, it felt like I was protecting you. It was the only thing that brought me happiness during those years. Oh, Marceline! [Crying] Simon? A-are you remembering? Pa-chazz! Shmowzow. Please, Simon! Remember our history! Our what now? Oh, Marceline. I heard everything. I was invisible. All your tiresome mortal emotions, they'll all be over soon. [to Ice King] Minion, I order you to kill Marceline. Whaaa?? No way! She's my pal! Are you disobeying me? Hey, it's called real talking. and you still can't get anything right, can you? Here's our chance! Please, baby, don't say that. You're my thrall. I am enthralled by you! You distract the Empress. Squeeze! Yaaaah! Ha! No! Heuk! Drat. Aaaaaaaah! You got this comin'. No! Simon, what are you doing? Let me go! If you want to hurt my lady, you'll have to go through me! Uuuuuugh! Now, Oaf! Kill her! Sweetie, there's no need to raise your voice. What?! Okay, that's it. Turn and look at me. Oh! Are we gonna gaze into each other's eyes again? You must fall deeper under my spell. Sell your spirit to the skies. I can see myself in your pupils. Hee-hee. You're not even hypnotized. At all. Them gigantic sparkly orbs of yours could hypnotize an earclops. So, you're not. Eh-heh, no. You're stupid donkey B-but honey, wh-why you being so mean to me? Because you're too thick to even fall under my spell. And you got no class. Oh, so you're doing that? You're gonna start name-calling? You want to play the blame game?! Okay! Well, if you weren't so perfect and and pretty and statuesque and and Come on, Simon. It's over. [Ice King crying] It's gonna be okay, man. Nope, nope. This way. This way. Come on, let's get you some ice cream. That's the last time you're gonna toy with his heart. Psht! If you really cared about him, why'd you let him degenerate into this pathetic clown character? He used to have more of a silver-fox thing going on, with his hair and those cute glasses. He was happier then, you know. When he was serving me. Aaaaaaah! Dang, girl. Aaah! Aaah! Aah! Gah! Open those peepers! Eat a stake! Huhn No! Ugh! I don't understand this. Marceline! Yeah, you're welcome! Hunh Um Marceline? All right. I shouldn't have tried to go it alone with the vamps. From now on, we'll do this team-up style. Okay, team. You're still invisible. Oh! Heh whoops. Oh! Hm. Candy Party! Jake! This party is so crazy! I know, Finn! I know! [Laughing] So, Finn... Do you have a girlfriend? Oh, my gosh! I can't believe you just said that. [Laughing] What a wonderful, marvelous party! Okay. I'm gonna do it. Okay-okay-okay. Everyone watch! I'm gonna do a flip! Princess Bubblegum's in trouble! Watch where you're going! Ahhhhhhhhhh! Please! Calm yourselves, my people. I am safe! Oh, thank you, Finn. You truly are my hero this day. Cool. Uhh... What'd you think of? [Whispering] Well, turn around. This entrance is secret. Oh. [Laughing] No way! [Pulling a yellow globe out of a chest] Here it is. Check it out. A magical globe? Golly! [Giggle] Look. See this book? Yeah, I see it! It's called the Enchiridion. It's a book meant only for heroes whose hearts are righteous. Shmow-zow! The book lies at the top of Mount Cragdor, guarded by a manly minotaur. It's waiting for a truly righteous hero to claim it! Do you think I've got the goods, Bubblegum? 'Cause I am in to this stuff! Then off I go! Jaaaaaaaaake! Thanks, pal. [Waving] Farewell, Fi—Oh, wait a minute... [reaching into her belt, she pulls out a handkerchief and waves it] Farewell, Finn the human boy! Bye, Princess! [To Jake] You know what time it is, buddy? Aaaaadventure time? Yeah, man! Greetings, young heroes to be. This mountain is called Cragdor. Its purpose is two-fold To protect the Enchiridion and to test the hearts of those who seek to possess it. Many noble challengers have entered the temple to pass the grueling trials that lie behind these walls, but no one has ever left here alive or dead! Only the truest most worthy hero can receive the heroes' Enchiridion and walk out these doors again! If it is you, friend, [giggles] and I cannot say that I am certain, but you are verily welcome to try; However, first you must pass my riddle. My name is Oh ho! You've unlocked the riddle of the door. [Laughing] Brilliantly done, child! Please, reveal to me how you unraveled my clue. I just thought you'd look cute stuffed in that lock. Oh, yes. That's how most people get in. Bye! You've passed the first trial, young heroes, but prepare yourselves! [To the camera] For there are many trials ahead of you, and each trial is more treacherous than the last. [Sniffs] Enchiridion is... [sniffs more, points] That way. What?! Dude! You can't smell the book from here! It's in the castle on top of the mountain. [Sniffs] In a room. [Laughing and tapping his nose] Wish you had one, huh? [Running towards the voices] This way! What about the book? It can wait. Someone needs our help. Yo, Finn. Are you alright? Did you get brain damage? I'm fine! Keep going! We have to hurry! I gotcha. Thank you for saving us. [Voice becomes menacing] Now we can destroy this old lady! La la la-la! What?! Every time you say "what" we'll destroy an old lady. [Shocked] What?! Every time you say "no" we'll destroy an old lady. [Panicked] No! Wai... Please... Don't destroy... Anymore... Old women. Every time you look sad we'll destroy a big old woman! Well... Ever since I got the... [Zapping sounds] Ahhhh! [To other gnomes] Hey, guys. Every time he's a big wuss, let's destroy an old lady. [Laughing] Yeah! Hey! Back off, you gnomes! That kid just saved you guys! You should thank him, not destroy old ladies! Do you even know what I'm talking about? Say thank you! Say... Thank... You. Kill him! [Shoving the gnomes back into the lava pit] Get back in there! Hey, Finn. You okay? No way, dude. Those old ladies are destroyed because of me. I'm not righteous. I'm wrongteous. Stupidteous. Awww. Don't let those gnomes and their illusions get you down. They're just gnomes and illusions. Illusions? Yeah, man. Think. What would regular, old, sweet ladies be doing wandering the hills of Mount Cragdor? Maybe they're lost? [Laughing] No way. This place is designed to mess you up. To mess with your head. None of this is real. It's all just trials to test your heroic attributes. Hmmm... Hmmm! Now let's go get that book. Yeah! You're the smartest dog I know, man. Jake? Jaaaaaaaake! You cannot pass! Gimme back my friend! No! [Popping out of the ogre's nostril] It's ok, Finn! I can get out! Let Jake go, or I'll... [kicking the ogre's foot] I'll kick your foot! [Laughing] It is impossible for you to hurt me! [Popping out of the ogre's ear and laughing] Don't worry, dude! I found another way—oof! Huh? [Starts climbing the ogre's leg] I'm coming, buddy! [Long burp] I think your dog finally fell into my stomach. Hey... Where'd you go? [Pulling a giant dollar out of the ogre's wallet] I got your wallet, man! No! My big money! Give it back! Give me back my friend! But I killed him already! [Crying] Fine. [Angry] I'll give you your dollar. [Yelling] Here's your dollaaaaaarrrrr! Oof! Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa-oa! [Gliding on the dollar towards Jake] Jake! [Grabbing Jake with his feet] You're okay! [Laughingly] Stomachs are weird. Dude! You just flew us all the way to the top! Wait a minute. [Sniff] I can smell the book right through this door. [Crying in the distance] You're under arrest for stealing my dollar! [Crying again] Just a minute, Jake. Hey! You know what that was? That was righteous. Thanks, Jake. Now sniff out that book for me. You got it! Whoa! Congratulations, Finn the human. You must be truly righteous to have made it this far. Thank you. Now! Enter my brain-world, and I will show you some aspect of yourself that you're not entirely aware of. Where... am I? [Disembodied voice] For your final trial, slay the beast! Why? Is it an evil beast? Yeeeeessss. It's completely evil. Will you slay it? Shoot, yeah. I'll slay anything that's evil. That's my deal. Yeeeeessss! You've done well, hero. Thank you. Now! As one last, last trial... Slay this ant! Is it evil? No! But it's not good either. It's, uh, neutral. Will you slay it? [Slamming his fist down next to the ant] No! If you want the heroes' Enchiridion, then slay this unaligned ant! Never. Never. Never! [Back in the real world] Uh oh. [Dressed like a devil] Congratulations, Finn the human. Now you have truly reached... Never! Ooh! Oh, no! Mr. Key-per! I-I'm sorry. Why are you wearing that little devil costume? These are my pajamas. I was getting ready for bed. [Running in] Finn... Jake... You made it! Are you another trial? Trial? Oh, no! [Laughing] I'm [Gasp] The manly minotaur from Princess Bubblegum's story! So, can I check out the Enchiridion? Can I? Can I? Can I? Yeah. Come on. Let's go check it out. [Running off] Woohoo! We've been watching you guys on our magical viewing globe. Take a seat guys, have some juice. There's grape and apple and the gatekeeper made spaghetti. And... Alright, Finn. Are you ready for this? The Enchiridion! [Handing the book to Finn] You deserve it, Finn. Really? It's true! [Laughing] Hey! Crack open that book and read something for fun's sake, alright? Oh, yeah. [Opens book] Whoa. How to Kiss Princesses? [Giggles] Whoa. What'd you just read? [Whispering to Finn] Hey. Don't tell her, Finn. It doesn't say anything, Princess. [Annoyed] Mannish Man! [Leaping into the air] Awwww... Yeah! Man, why am I so sleepy? [getting a banana] Dude, we've been up for like seven days. [breathing] For real-sies? Yeah, for real-sies! [Flashback begins.] Remember? First, we rescued the Slime Princess from the Ghost Ship Vortex. And then we slayed that fire dragon. And that took a couple of days. Then we went to LSP's quinceañera. Oh, no way. You guys made it! Helped Peppermint Butler with his Goblin problem. I swear that I found it like this. I don't know what happened. We'll take care of it, Peppermint Butler. We rescued Wildberry Princess from the Ice King. I just wanna be happy! Then, we captured that Bandito. Thanks, you guys. Saved the house... Thanks, you guys. And fed that duck. We've had a busy week. I'm exhausted. But happy! Good night, buddy. Good night! [to himself] That's right, Yeah? Can you sleep? No. I can't sleep either. Yeah, what's going on with that? I don't know. But, I've got the strangest feeling...that we're being watched. Why is that horse staring at us? That's super creepy. Man, I just wanna go to sleep. Well, maybe he's gone. Not gonna be able to sleep with that horse watchin' me. Let's just close the shade. Outta sight and outta mind. Good work, Jake See 'ya in the morning, pal. Ahh! Why won't it stop?! All right, man. Let's just go...push it off that hill or something. Maybe we can just...politely ask it to leave. Hey! Get out of here, horse! I want to go to sleep, and you're creeping me the math out! Whoa, man! Let me try, diplomat style. [walks over to the horse] Pardon me horse, I beseech thou to split from mine land, this night. But I welcome thee to come back for some luncheth, some other day. Okay? Forget it, man. This horse is whack. It's got poo-brain. [Sighs] Okay, you're right. We can try pushing it, now. Move, horsey! Good Grod, Jake! Are you even pulling?! I'm super-pulling! This horse has a ridiculous weight! Math this. What now, man. I didn't wanna have to use my powers on you, horse, because I'm so sleepy. But you've pushed RAAAAHH! AH-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA! You shouldn't creep us out from way over there! Let's get back to bed, buddy. Oh yeah, I'm so ready for bed. I wanna marry my bed. Me too! No more.... NO MORE! Where are you going?! I have an idea! [runs up to the horse, and flakes a blindfold on his face] I did it! Ha-ha! He can't stare at us if he's blind! Look, man. [points behind Jake] Wh..why?! Stupid blindfold! What's your deal, screwy?! Why are you messin' with us, huh?! Jake! That horse is whack with poo-brain. Yeah, I know, Finn. I diagnosed this horse with whacked out poo-brain five minutes ago. Dude, poo-brain means we can lure it away from here using music. [Meteor then appears on-screen] Everything brainless likes music. That's true! You're a genius! [goes to get his viola] All right horse, prepare to be lured! [walks off and plays Beethoven's, "Moonlight Sonata"] Follow me, Horsey. Jake? It's not luring! Huh! Hmmm. [plays Symphony No. 5 in C minor] So, Beet-hoven's not luring enough for you, is it? Well, how about some Mozzart?! [plays Mozart's "Eine Kleine Nachtmusik"] Huh?! Ha! [closes his eyes] Stop! You're luring snakes! STOP!! Huh? Oh, nuts. Let me try and lure a mongoose! [starts playing, "Ride of the Valkyries"; Finn throws Stop man! No! Ahh! [sighs] Dude... let's kill the horse. What?! I'm so tired, Finn! No, man, we're not killing the horse. Okay, we won't kill the horse. We'll dress him up like a bunny! Ha-ha! And get a giant hawk—Caaaww!--To kill him! Wah?! Caaawww! Caaawwwwww! No, man! That is wrong. Eh. Did I say that the hawk would kill him? I meant that the hawk would swoop down gently and take him away to an island of sunshine and love-stuff and, take care of him. Whoa. That sounds awesome. What do think? It looks like a bunny? Hey Come and get it hawk, let's go! Hey Jake, I think I see a hawk or two. [sees hawks] Cause more commotion to help the hawks! Ahhh! Blblblblblblblblblbl! [continue to scream like crazy] Take the bunny! Hey, there they are! They see our commotions! Riiiiiighhhhhht here! Yeah! Grab a good hold and fly away! The bunny! The bunny! What a beautiful sight. We did it! Back to sleep! [run away laughing and screaming] Good night, buddy. Good night, buddy. Ahh! It's in our house now! That's obvious, Finn! You don't have to say that out loud! Hey, this is all your fault, dude! If you weren't so darn handsome, animals wouldn't always be staring at you! You're just mad at me for being...handsome? Well, you're the one who told me to lure snakes! Ahhh! I told you to lure the horse! You lured the snakes! There's even one here in my underpants! [sighs] Wait a minute, dude. Can't you see what this horse is doing? [long silence] It's tearing us apart. Aw, man.. you're right! We have to get rid of this horse, for us! I know, bro. I know. [The two hug] Oh, Finn; this horse is bringing us together now. This horse is a blessing. What?! Dude, you've lost it! You...wait, wait. [crying] The horse is tearing us apart again! You're right! It's about time I show this horse who's the man. What are you going to do? Say that to me again. What are you going to do?! Do... Doo-doo. I'm going to kick that horse in the bottom! Oh, my Grod! The Ice King?! I should go. You were spying on us?! That's none of your business! He was trying to learn our bedtime secrets! [gasps] Were you? [gasps] He was! Did you find out that I sleep "in the nude"? It's none of your business how nude I sleep, Ice King! Nnnnone of your business! Gentlemen, I'll see you later. Hmph! Here's your sword, dude! Thank you. Jake! Jake! Look out! Tell us why you were spying! NO! Snakes! Quick! Throw them to the Ice King! What's he doing? He's using his ice powers. Ow! Ouch! Ow! Hey! Hey! Is that all the ice ya have? Yeeesss! Well, you should really have more. We don't need any more. What if you had guests? Guests bring their own ice. Tell us why you're watchin' us or we'll - we'll cut off your stupid head. Yeah and make it quick 'cause we're both really sleepy. Ok, ok, I'll tell you! I was watching you... to learn how to be happy. What? Huh? It's true! I would like to be happy like you guys. But, I have no idea how. So, you dressed up like a horse? Have pity on me. [flashback begins] I've been so sad and miserable, I cry all the time. But, whenever I see you two, you always look so happy. But, they're just hopping over each other. So yes, I've decided to spy on you, dressed as a horse. [shows the Ice King getting dressed up, aided by the penguins.] But, I guess my plan failed. All I observed was you two arguing over...how to get rid of me. Hey, are you sleeping? [gasp] Is this it? Sleeping? Could it be that all I need is a good night's rest? [closes his eyes.] Ahh... I'm... still not happy. [Clears throat] Okay, so here's what happened. I had sent my top employee, Rennie Hamlin, to check on one of my properties... Okay, boss, I'm here now. [Narrating] ...Joshua and Margaret Investigations! Yep, there's definitely been a break-in. Check out the damage. I'll call you back in thirty seconds. [Over the phone] Rennie? [Stammering incoherently.] And he's been like this ever since. Poor guy. Something terrifying has taken residence in Joshua and Margaret's old office, and it's not paying rent. So I want you guys to find out what it is and get it out. Yes, sir, son! You have one hour! Bye, dad. [He teleports out.] I wonder what it could be. Maybe it's a gross rotting fish gob with long, slimy tentacles. Maybe it's a teenage silverware werewolf squatter. Hey, you know what it could be? It could be a ghost. I think I saw a ghost there when I was a baby. Maybe it's like a ghost hotspot. Ghosts, huh? Whoa, wait! What if it's... [Together] Ghost Mom and Dad! I have to brush my hair! I'll go get tulips for Mom! Man, I've never been this excited about ghosts before. This could be one more chance to tell Mom and Dad how much we love them. And show 'em that their kids are awesome. Hello? Ghosts? If you're in here, please vacate my son's property! Unless you're Mom and Dad ghosts! Yeah, in that case, I brought flowers! Look. There's the broken window. But I don't see any signs of squatters... or ghosts. [Pots the flowers] I'll sniff 'em out. [Sniffing] Hey Jake, why don't we own this place? I dunno. Kim Kil Whan is a good businessman. Plus I'd feel kinda weird dealing with this stuff. Yeah. Just looking at all this is like, "Whoa, memories!" Like this ticker tape machine. Remember when Mom and Dad brought us to work and we made a fort of ticker tape? It was right over there! And over here you gave me a wet willie one time. Ew. No I didn't. Right. I know you believe that's true, but memories distort over time. Classic false memory syndrome. Maybe you're the one with a false memory syndrome. Classic false memory syndrome response. You hear that? Can you use your dog powers to locate that sound? [With enlarged ears] Way ahead of you, pal. Uh... over there! [He runs over to the bathroom and barges in.] Aha! [There's nothing there, and the ticking has stopped.] Anything? Nope. This is a nice bathroom, though. Man, this whole office is nice. It's kinda bunk how Mom and Dad stopped using it. Yeah, it's weird that they had this whole other life, and they just dropped it for us babies. We were babies forever. Man, we suck. [Exiting the bathroom] Yeah, but they knew what they were getting into. Whoa! Who moved the sofa? Who put forth those chairs?! Who set the table?! What's going on?! This griz is poltergeist biz. But I don't want that. Embrace the paranormal, bro. [Examining the candles on the dining table] Are these candles real or poltergeist mind-tricks? Look! [Together] Poltergeist! Ooh, goody. It's on now, dear. Well done, Margaret, love. [Together] Dad! Hello, future people. I'm Hello. We're making this tape to document the strange phenomena in our new office. Like this weird message spelled out in- [ You've really stepped in it now, darling. Indubitably. But something is definitely trying to chat us up, and we're gonna catch it on film. I got this fancy ghost-hunting doohickey. It's supposed to record EVPs and such. [The ticking is heard, and Gracious, there it is! Margaret! Margaret! There's another one over here! Dude! This place is full of ghosts! We should split up and see if we can get them to appear. I'll take the bathroom! That's the spirit. Hmm. "Spirit." Maybe Mom and Dad left some books about ghost hunting. Hmm. [He examines some of the books on the shelf, then hears the ticking again. A ghost appears from around the corner.] [Gasps] A ghost! [The ghost fades away.] It seems like the ticking precedes each ghost encounter. Okay, The bathroom is a lot scarier than I was expecting. ...hearts, egg timers, typewriters. What else? [The ticking is heard, and three small ghosts appear next to Babababa! [Chuckles] Oh yeah? Oh! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip! [Laughs] Oh, snap. I guess it was me. Hold on. These babies ain't ghoulish ghosts at all. They're like time... disto...to...morphs? Hmm. Scared? No way! I'm primitive! I'm real! Ghosts, you can't touch this dog! You've got ethereal hands! I'm alive! I'm filled with hot blood! You'll never see through me! [He bursts into the bathroom again.] Gotcha, ghoul! Pardon? Aah! Oh, sorry for interrupting your poop. [ [Screams] [Screams and exits again.] I gotta get out of here! No, [Strained] Margaret, stay away! Huh? [He looks out the window.] Something's about to happen! Dad? So, I can see you, and you can see me. And we're occupying the same space now. So this time stuff must be getting more intense. [The shape-shifter appears at the window.] Whoa! [Straining] [Farts loudly, his diaper sagging downward] [Sighs with relief] [Sniffs the air] [Holds Baby Jake away] Aw, dude! You couldn't wait until you were back in your own time? Hey, creeper, stop creepin' on baby Jake! [The shape-shifter exits, and the babies disappear.] Baby Jake? [Enters] Finn! I'm freaking out, man! I just saw the most messed-up thing! Dad? Margaret, stay away! Something's about to happen! Something's about to happen with me, too! Margaret! Aah! [His head swells and pops.] Yowzas! [Singing] Hello, Daddy! Hello, Mommy! It's so nice to be here with you now! That's so not how I was birthed! I'm no melon baby! I'm a majestic womb baby! Jake, calm down. I'm gonna go hog-wild on the next ghost I see! Boy, do I love real estate! Aah! [He exits.] [Over the phone] Rennie? [Stammering incoherently.] We're trapped in a ghost trap! Relax, bro. There's no ghosts. What we're experiencing are time slips. Point is, something is causing this. You ready? Time dingalings! Wait, that ticking. I know who this is! [He and Jake walk over to the ghosts, where they take the place of two of them; their future selves. The third ghost resolves, and is revealed to be Clock Bear.] Clock Bear! One of the dudes that escaped Dr. Gross' menagerie. He must be the one causing the time slips. There's us from before. [He points to the attic's entrance hatch, where their past selves are climbing up.] [Groans] Are you sick? Yeah, I'm pretty disgusted with the whole situation! I meant Clock Bear. [Shouting over the noise] He's sucking up all the spilled time! That doesn't sound scientific! [Gasps] Jake, take care of Clock Bear. There's something I gotta do! Wait, I'm still confused! And having feelings! Oh boy, our first case! Looks like we have a poltergeist! [The tape spells out "I love u".] And it's got a little crush on me. What a sassafrass! Gotta get this one tape! [As he reaches for the tape on the bookshelf, he causes it to rattle and fall to the ground.] Whoops! If this was all time weirdness, I guess that memory was true. I did see my own birth. Far out. [ We have to leave! We're doin' what now? It was just Clock Bear... No, I don't think he has any money. [  [on holo-pendant] Hey, Finn! How's the mission going? So far, no sign of the Bird Man. Why's this guy so dangerous? Some say he's a half-man, half-bird that poops fire while he flies. It's all rumors so far. That's why I need you and Jake to find out everything you can about him and report back to me. Where are you? Under the sea. The mermaids are trying to beach themselves. I came to see why. Turns out they're just lonely. [laughs] Maybe I'll go hang out with them after this biz. Sounds great, Finn. Okay. Bye, PB. Bye! C'mon, let's go look for that creep! Whoa. [coughs] Huh? Where am I? This is the rookery, where I and my bird friends dwell! So are you, like, the Great Bird Man? That's what they call me nowadays. But when I first met you, Finn, and you, Jake, you knew me as [suddenly, Whaaa—?! When we first met, I was crazy for smacking goblin hams. I was cruel, selfish, brutal. But every thing changed after I was defeated by the two of you! So, you got some sleek new shades, and now everything's different? Oh, no, my change has been deep. And these whatsits are only curtains for empty windows. Whoa. What happened there? I miffed off a wizard, and he took my eyes. [His eyes are seen attached to his beard.] I wonder what he wanted them for—some kind of lotion... or potion... or time-traveling spell. I'll never know. Never, ever, never. But losing my eyesight was only the beginning of my wonderful change! I started meditating and doing yoga. Now I can "see" with my heart and smell with my soul. You smell with your beard? I smell with my nose! Lame. Om. What are you doing? Oh, Taffy! You heard my call! [ Oh, uh, me and Jake will follow you. Jake needs to stretch out and stuff. Okay, great! Well, follow me! It's crazy, right?! The way dude's eyeballs are just hangin' there. I know! I almost told him 'cause it was driving me nuts! Yeah, me too! Do you think he's got evil intentions behind his reborn star-child act? I don't know. But if he does, I'm gonna find out. Yeah, me too. Nice and cool down here, isn't it? A-ha! Listen to the babies! Num-num time! Aw, hey, that's cute. [off-screen] There you go, little ones. Suckle, suckle! They're small, but they sure can take a lot out of you. Whoo! Dizzy. Sometimes feeding really wipes me out. I hope you'll excuse me while I refocus my qi. [He exits.] See you in a while! Now's our chance to do some snooping. Jake! [ [while picking up a weapon] Hmm. What is it? A fighting stick? A dagger? This one's a letter from the hospital. You can read those bumps with your fingers? Yeah, I learned braille from my ex. Your ex was blind? Nah, just cool. [reading off of tablet] "Dear Xergiok, thank you so much for your donation. The kidneys fit great." [stops reading] Well, geez, maybe he has changed his ways! Maybe. Let's keep looking. [while falling] Doy! Oh! Oh, crease! Psychic links! Cardamom, my friend, I'm coming! I'm com— [ Wha—? Shush, child! Ah, Finn and Jake, you are here! Where'd you learn that heal spell? I use no magic. I manipulated space with a vibrational chant. You see, now the injury has transferred to me! [ Dirt? Yeah, look! [ Listen, man. About your eyes. Yes, a wizard stole them. Alright, but not— [Jake turns Finn! What are you doing, man? Dude, he's changed! Are you sure? Uh, yeah, man. Isn't it kind of obvi? Alright, tell him. Tell me what? Your eyes weren't stolen by a wizard. They're in your beard. Alright. Oh, where are they? [ Dude, your eyes are in your beard. A-ha, what? Good job, guys. Goofin' on the blind guy—real nice! No, man, they're right here. [ What my life?! We didn't tell you 'cause we thought you might still be a wong lord! And these aren't grapes, right? No, man. Hmm. Finn and Jake, could you help me onto Cardamom's back? I would like to be high in the clouds, bathed in the pinks and the blues of the desert twilight, when I restore my sight. Sure, okay. [ Climb aboard! Vanilla! Chocolat! Cinnamon! Agave! All my friends, to the sky! [ How's it feel, man? Oh, yeah, it's overwhelming. This view takes me back. I always loved the sunset. And the silhouettes of my little goblins lined up to receive their spankings! [ You were in the desert a long time, man. Yes, twenty years. Nah, it was more like one year and change, dude. Yes, things certainly have changed for me in that time. Say, who's ruling the uh, Goblin Kingdom since I left? Whisper Dan. Oh, Whisper Dan! That's cool. Cool, cool. Hey, you guys wanna ride back to your crib? Yeah, sure, man. Uh, wait. Xergiok, this is the Goblin Kingdom. I know, but I was thinking—now that I'm wiser, I could rule as king again! That idea is terrible. Well, you know, I disagree! And I have my army of bird friends, so anyone who disagrees with me should get a [yells] SPANKING! [laughs maniacally] Hey, Jeff, is that your real laugh? [chuckles to himself] No, it's Xergiok. Oh, Glob! [ Oh, dang! [ [while stretching the leg he stole from Jake] Oh, yeah, baby! Come on, man. Are you for real? Attack, birds, attack! Where's the butt on this thing? [ Wait! Cardamom! Nougat! Stevia! Dang! You lost your friends, dude. Yeah, I feel myself hitting bottom again. Yup, okay, here we go. [ Here, Finn. Take my eyes and bury them forever. I will not need them again. Okay, man. [ [while walking away] Thanks. Are you gonna be alright, man? It's cool. Bye! Dude, that sucks. I hope he finds peace, or something. He's going to the reservoir! [We see Xergiok walking towards a large body of water.] Um, why is he doin' that? Maybe he's thirsty. [Xergiok walks into the water.] Oops, I guess he was just sad. Should we save him? Nah, man, he's fine. What the—? I found a girlfriend! [ [panting] Remember last time we were out this way? It was right after you messed things all up with Flame Princess. [chuckles] Yeah, that sucked. But then we found the Dungeon Train, remember? That was awesome. No, it wasn't. Sure it was. Anyway, Flambo's brother's map says the weird cave should be like, right over... Ah! It's right here. [chuckles] Come on, Jake. Okay, hold on. Let me get out my sidewalk chalk. I want to write all over the walls in there. What? You can't use that stuff in here. This is like an ancient, sacred temple. Oh, well, now, that's just great. You don't put traps in the foyer! The foyer is a safe space. Man, not even Jake could smash through this mess. But maybe there's a back door or something. Uh oh! Options. Better leave a little trail in case I get lost. Bread-crumb style. Plus, for if Jake gets in and tries to track me down. Too bad I don't still have that sidewalk ch... Oh! Okay, well, scratch that. Now I really hope there's another way out. Hall of Egress. Egress, egress. [in [in Finn's flashback] Exit. Egress means exit! Great. What am I supposed to do now? [inhales, then falls back through the hatch and on to the ground] Wait. Hey. Hey, I just smashed you. I... Ah... Magic door, okay. Right, but if I... Well done, Hmm. Smooth like metal. Floor's smooth too. What have we here? An errant thread! [chuckles] It must lead back out. Bread-crumb... Oh, trap door? [grunts] Spike trap. Better head back and regroup. Fiendish. Anyway, don't let's do that again. And right then straight. And... Hey now. Hold the phone, there should be a left turn here. Letters? E... G... 'Egress'. It spells 'egress'. This way! And here's another one, and another... [trap door opens] Whoa! Okay. So, every map I make is wrong. All the exit signs led to traps. Plus the braille, the hieroglyphics, and the tape recorder message too. It's  almost like the maze is trying to tell me something. Something confusing, whatever! Who needs anyway with your stupid signs and messages? I'm Finn? Fi-inn! Jake! Jake, I'm coming! Finn? Where are ya, buddy? Jake! That's a little disappointing. Still, though. I'm in the homestretch here. Jake! Finn! There you are. Yeah. Sorry to pop up, then disappear again like that. Again? You just got here, son. I did? Shoot, man. This cave has got me straight scrambled up and down. What cave? What? Oh. Uh oh. Well? Well, I followed your map, but there's just a bunch of grass here. What? Let me see! [opens his eyes] Dang it. So, yeah. Everything I did to try to make sense of the maze or to play it safe totally backfired, but when I got fed up, and started just charging in willy-nilly, I was able to get to the end and find you. And then the whole thing disappeared. But I wonder how come I don't remember any of it. I don't know. I'm just hoping, maybe if I sleep it off, maybe I'll be better in the morning. Okay, well... Good night, buddy. Thanks, Jake. Good night. Are you awake? Yes. Are you gonna open your eyes now? Maybe. Are you scared? No. Then do it. On three. One, two, three,... So, been almost a month now. What do you think? You wanna try opening 'em? It's beautiful day. Plus, I need someone to tell me if this hat looks cool. Man I told you. If I open 'em now, it'll just be the same. I got to wait till something's different. Yeah, that makes sense, I guess. So, um, I got you a little something, a little present. Wow, thanks man! You're really gonna thank me. Gotcha! No! Yeah, you've done it, like, 30 times now. It's like programmed into your DNA or something. Well, shoot, man. If I wanna do it that bad, it must be kinda right, right? [sighs] Look at it from where I'm sitting. All this funky pizzazz that only you can see, that's like the literal definition of a hallucination, either all that stuff is a dream or like, I'm a dream. And I ain't no dream, ya heard? Yeah, I know, I heard. It's just that, well... Hyah! Open up! Oh, Jake, I know you mean well, but I guess I got to see this one through on my own. [sighs] I'll see you around, buddy. Huh? What the... How long has this been going on? Someone's apt to track me down, bread-crumb style, e.g. Jake. Can't let him catch me. No more threads to follow. No more egress. Hmm. It's cool in here... Ain't nothing wrong with that. Deep too. That's good. Ain't nobody gonna be looking for me down. Ugh! [gasps, and starts shouting] Egress! Egress! Egress! Egress! Something's different. Hurry, Finn. At the seashell's center lies, the cornucopia's smallest door. Whoa! That must have been some cave! No comment! ] You getting all bit up by mosquitoes? I don't know... I'm getting bit up by something. Man, I can't believe you said this was a good swimming hole. I said it might be good. It's not, though. True. Wanna just go? Yeah. This place smells like green beans. My name's Woobeewoo. [Turning around] Oh, whoa! [Hops onto a rock] I need your help. My people are in trouble. I'm a mudscamp. Yeah, Woobeewoo! Of course we'll help. Why didn't you just say something before? I'm shy. It took me a while to work up the nerve. Oh. Right on. You good now? We'll see. [Turns around] Come, I'll take you to my village. Here we are the village of my people. It doesn't have an official name, but I call it South This is the village elder. He'll fill you in on the "deets." Greetings, heroes. [Squirts Jake with red juice] [Disgusted] Bleehhh! Aw! Ehhh! I'm so sorry about that. You know, we--we secrete stink oil all day out our awful-sauce glands. You know, I guess I should have warned you. Anyway, lemme cut the cheese. [Whispering] Cut to the chase. Yes... I mean--I mean, of course "cut to the chase," I mean, for many--for many moons now our village has been under siege by the Mega Frog. He's 100 stories of 110% 10-speed terror, like, bam, like, fresh out the grease. I mean, he chases us all up and down from first base to home, trying to eat us alive. We--we've always managed to escape, but it's c-razy scary, I mean, w-what if you got ate? Think about it. [Stands up] All alone in a stomach full of acid. [High voice] "Mommy! Mommy, Mommy, help me!" [Lower voice] "Billy, is that you? Mommy you sound exactly--" [High voice] "Mommy you sound exactly like m--" [sneezes] "Mommy, you sound exactly like me!" [Lower voice] "Billy, uh--" [Sits down; normal voice] Anyway. If this keeps up, we'll have to move to the city and get jobs. We don't know how to--how to do anything cool. Look, [Woobeewoos dressed in business hats are seen in the village] see, th-they're already practicing, the poor fools. They don't know what they're in for. Whoa, relax, buddy! You're talkin' to the right couple of guys. Yeah, man! Me and Jake will bust this Mega Frog up, right up his bumble-stop. [Imitates bomb whistling, exploding] That is excellent news. I mean, h-here, take this, please. [Woobeewoo villagers bring in a bag of lollipops] It's not much, b-but it's all we have-- [Finn takes bag] it's--it's a bag of lollies. That's nice! Thanks, man. Now farewell, heroes! We're counting on you... for reals! [Sniffing] Hmm. Gettin' anything? Yeah, but it's hard to make out. Could just be some footprints... or an old doodie. Word... Hey, I have an idea. We can use those lollipops to leave a trail. That way we won't get lost out here. Yeah, that's a great idea, man. I was just gonna throw 'em all on the ground anyway. [Drops a lollipop while walking] Whomp. [Drops another] Whomp. [Drop] Whomp. [Drop] Whomp. [Sniffs the air and points] This way. [The two climb a fallen log bridging a ravine] The thing with frogs is they got a real subtle smell. Kinda like when you open up a new thing of, um... CDRs. Like... electric celery? Yeah... but subtler. [They come across a large footprint] Mm-HMM! Just as I suspected. Sweet. These'll take us right to him. [Laughs as he runs along the path of footprints] Come on, Jake! [Continues laughing] Hmm. Huh. We've passed this butt tree, like, three times. Oh, yeah. We should probably backtrack--get reoriented and all that. Word. [Sees footprints overlapping and facing different directions] Wait, these prints are all messed up! Whoa. Yeah! Guess we better follow the lollipops back. Where's those at? [Holds up empty bag] We ran out of those a while ago. Snaaaap. Totally lost. Dang! Do you think maybe the Mega Frog made all those footprints on purpose? So we'd use up all our lollies and get totally lost? What? Nah, man! Frogs are mighty dumb, you know that. He's probably runnin' around like that 'cause he's lost! [Laughs] Plus, we're not even lost. I just gotta stretch up past these trees and see where we're at. [Stretches head above canopy] Dang. It's all misty! It's kinda nice up here, though. [Lightning strikes his head, screams as he stretches back down] AAAAAAAAH! Man, forget that! I can't see anything through that mist. Plus, I got struck by lightning. We're just gonna have to set up camp and wait out the storm. Cool! I call fire patrol! Yeah, me, too! [Laughs] Do you remember how to make a fire with sticks? Yeah, man--it's easy. [Picks up two twigs] Uhhh, rub 'em together, right? Oh, yeah. I don't think it's workin', man. I think I saw some guy do it like this once. [Spins twig out of his hands] That's not it. I think you're on to something, though. Yeah, here we go! [Wraps twine around a twig] [Blows on a twig while twisting it] Friction! [Pulls twine, twig snaps] [Knocking two twigs together] Come on, boys, come on! [Kissing twig] Mwah! [Sets down twig and writes FIRE in the dirt; shrugs] I don't know. [Rubbing his hands together while holding a stick] You just gotta get some momentum going. [Pokes himself in the face with the stick; muffled] AAAAAAH! Glob-globbing stick! Glob-globbing swamp! [Streches up above trees and gets struck by lightning] AAAAAAAAAAAAH! [Comes down with lit stick, drops stick onto pile of sticks, runs off screen while screaming, comes back] Oh, hey, you got the fire goin'. Right on! Jake, how did you--? [Roar is heard off screen] What the--? It's the Mega Frog! Quick, put the fire out! Jake, look! [Silhouette of Mega Frog is seen crouching in field] He's just sittin' there! What's he doin' out there? I don't know, but let's pound him while he's vulnerable. Okay, Sweetles. [ [Pulls on ear and lifts and drops his jowls] Whoaa! [Heads toward frog] [Runs, jumps, gets ready to punch frog] Hoi-YAAAH! Wha--? [Walks over to Jake] Jake, wake up. Look! Ow, my head hurts. [Pointing] Look at that thing! Oh, what?! [Birds land on the wooden structure] Yeah, [laughs]. Hey, whoa! That gives me a great idea. We can make a Finn and Yeaaaah! That's a great idea, man! [Mega Frog comes up from behind [Looking at Mega Frog] Fuh-fuh-fuh... fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh... [continues] What? What is it, Jake? FUH-FUH-FUH-FROOOOOOG!! Wha--? [Frog squeezes Jake, let's hide in this cave. [They run into the cave] Shmow-tow, dude! That guy's gonna dingle our bones into tapioca pudding! Finn, that is gross, man! Don't use language like that. [As blow lands] Chomp that! Aaaah! He's eating me! Aah! Gently eating me! No teeth! Mostly tongue! [Still on the ground] Hmm? Hmmm... [Flashback] I need your help. My people are in trouble... I'm shy... I mean, he chases us all up and down from first base to home. We've always managed to escape--. You gettin' anything? Yeah, but it's hard to make out. I'm shy... first base... Yeah, but it's hard to make out. I'm shy. ...it's hard to make out. Hmmm. That's it! [Gets up] Jake, wait! [Pushes frog away from him] Oof! Sick, dude! [Sees Finn] Huh? [Climbing Jake] I know how to stop him! [Runs up Jake, jumps off his head toward the frog, flies through the air, kisses the frog; slow-mo] Mwah! [Lands hanging on to a stalactite] Ah, this is rad! I'm hot again! Thanks, little dudes! [Takes Finn down from stalactite] I really appreciate it! [Gives thumbs up] I don't get it, though... I kissed just about everything I could get my lips on. How come it only worked with you? You can't break your own curse by kissin' somebody. Somebody's gotta kiss you. Oh. Weird. Well, thanks, man. I don't know a lot of dudes who'd do that to help a guy out. Whatevs. [Laughs, flies out of the cave] “Mom, I wanna play outside with consuelo!” “Cool your jets! It’s super dangerous outside. Little kids have to stay in the castle.” “But I’m rowdy.” “Yeah, well, but look.” “See what happens? You want a playdate with death? That’s why you have to stay inside. And, cause consuelo’s mom is a pain in the neck. I-” In the heat of the sun you burn like a pink little baby! Help! What? Oh, a scream! Help! Well, now, what seems to be the trouble? I saw something in the water, and I was like, “No thanks!” Out of my way, muffin man! How rude! Well, whatever that little girl saw will be a mystery forever. Transport for seeker X-J-77 Strong has arrived. Oh, trust me, I’m strong indeed. Pow, pow! Eh? Not enough? You need to feel them guns? Verifying. Woah! Well, hello frisky! Todd! I’m right here! Identifying. Dangerous mutant. Initiating defensive mode. Seeking human. Human. Come home to safety. Seeking human. Human. Come home to safety. Hey, Jake, what about this one? Great. We’re gonna look so great for this funeral. How do you like my bandeau? I was too embarrassed to get a bra fitting. I know they are professionals, but it’s just too intimate. You look great! Settlement detected. Continuing search for X-J-77. Get him! Attack! Attack! Hostile cylinders detected. Release countermeasures. Hostile cylinders immobilized. Engaging hostile bobbleheads. Neutralizing. Please do not turn your system off during neutralization. Holy mud! It took out the Gumball Guards like they was nothin’!  We gotta chop this thing into smashaghetti. I’ll take you out with these hug nubs! Ah! I’ll help you, Finn! Ah! Help me, Finn! Hostile mutant neutralized. [Thinking] You got this, Rush! Verifying. Human identified. Infant PG-8-7 Mertens. PG-8-7. Uh… You mean me? You will assist this transport in locating seeker X-J-77. PG-8-7 Mertens, please climb aboard. Please climb aboard. Come on. Mertens? Wait, do you, like, know me? Got it! Great work distracting ‘em, Finn. You okay, dude? I feel like that ship might’ve been important, but I’m fine. Yeah, my hands are a little sore from smashing, but I’m fine too. Hiyah! Ha ha! Once again, BMO! BMO, you okay? Signal received. XJ-7-7 requests transport. Hey. Hi, Finn. Uh, sorry again my grass arm busted you up. It’s okay. At the time, He’s outside. He’s bringing the ship over. The ship? Oh, ship. How ‘bout it, Suze? Does any of this look familiar? Me and Finn took this whole bad block down ourselves! Took a bit of fananglin’, but I never hunt what I can’t catch. Hey. Looking for this? I’ve been holding onto the remnants of your cranial implant since you kidnapped Finn and almost killed Jake. You remember that? I’m running a comparative mass spec test now. Yep. Looks like both your implant and the ship have the same technological origin. Human technology. Finished! Looks like BMO’s finally downloaded the ship’s last commands. Signal received. Proceed to extraction point. Return seeker XJ-7-7 and cargo to Founders Island, Home. BMO, can you give us printouts? Yes, okay. Printing. Hmm. Man, this island’s way far out there.  I don’t know, Susan. It’s so far. Even I don’t know what’s out there. It’s a pretty risky solo mission. I’m going too. I mean, we gotta find out where this ship came from. There could be more of them. And, if this is human-made, then there might be other humans on that island. That’d be cool to see, right? I’ll come too! And so will we! No, we won’t. Oh. Well, it sounds like you’re all determined. You should borrow my boat, though. This thing is trashed. We don’t need a boat! Have you forgotten? With a little imagination… ...I can be anything that you could ever... ...Oh, I lost focus. Hey, yeah, can we borrow your boat? Are you up here, Fern? Hey. Thanks for letting me crash on the roof. It’s nice up here. Stay as long as you want. I came up here to ask a favor. I might be gone for a while on this trip, see, and I need someone to, uh, cover for me here in Ooo. Are you sure? I mean, hero biz is your whole thing. And, whatever I am, I’m not you. You can just do your own thing with it. Like, if some huge gross monster’s gonna do murder on a buncha innocents, uh, kill it! But kill it you-styles. Just don’t go nuts. Okay, I can handle that. Thanks for trusting me. No, thank you, Fern. I better go pack. Uh… We should figure out a better thing. Let’s figure out something better. Hey… Dad. Charlie, hi. It’s me! It’s dad. I have to go on a sea voyage, honey. I wanted to say bye. That’s cool. Hey, you can’t see this shirt, right? This shirt has like, four different breakfasts on it. I can’t hear anything. Bye, love you! Mwah! Mkay, dad. I’ll tell the other pups. And, I’m telling the other pups! Aw, I’m gonna miss you so much, lady. 아우 너무 걱정하지 말고 그냥 가서 좋은 형님 노릇하고와. 그리고 올때 기념품이나 사오고. ("Don't worry too much, just go and be a good brother. And when I come, I'll buy souvenirs.") Finn, did you bring your nail clippers? Uh, I think so. Cool, I forgot too. Bye, treehouse! Goodbye, creator! Now me and BMO can really cut loose. Look, BMO! I am pretending to trash a hotel room. BMO? Ouch. Thanks for seeing us off, guys. Yeah, of course. It’s my boat. And we care about him, you dingus! Come on! Sorry, Marcy is up past her bedtime. No, it’s true. I want you to be really careful out there. Don’t worry. We’ve got Susan. That’s not what I mean. Finn, I get the sense that this trip’s more important to you than you’re letting on. I mean, if you make it to that island, you might find out some pretty heavy stuff. About the humans and where you came from. About yourself. All I’m saying is, you have to promise me, promise me, that you’ll come home safe. I- Hi Bonnie! Ah! I’m I have a lot of fuzzy half-memories from when I was this guy. Well, just keep the ones where she’s our boss, and forget everything else. Finn? Hey! Good morning. Boat’s loaded, ready to go. Ah! I flinched. It’s cool. We’ll be back soon, I promise! Bye, kids! Don’t be naughty. Bye! Good luck! He’ll be safe. [Looks at Fern] Hey, aren’t you that dude that totaled Starchy’s motorcycle? [Singing] Baby! Ooo! [Singing] I know what you need. What's that? [Singing] You want your little baby socks, for your little baby feet. Woo! [Singing] Baby! Yeah? [Singing] I know what you crave. Oh, yeah? What's that? [Singing] You want to poop your pants all day long. Well, baby behave! Hey, how can you sing like that, dude? Remember when I swallowed that little computer? Oh, yeah. Alright, Stanley. You and your family are safe... Again... Seriously, Stanley. For a watermelon you get into trouble way more often than you should. W-whoa! What the... Shmow-zow! Look at that! That... is the most adorable thing I have ever seen. And he loves your baby song. Sing some more of it, dude. Alright. [Singing] Baby! You lookin' so good. You lookin' like you might... want some baby food. Keep it going, man! [Laughs] [Singing] Baby! You lookin' so fine. You lookin' like you might... just start cryin'. [Laughs] Yeah! Dude! This guy... is a pal for life! It looks like he's got two jiggly bellies stuck together. I've got that on my back. I call it my butt. Whoa! [Laughs] He's the Jiggler. [Laughs] You are the best thing ever. Let's take the Jiggler back to the house and just stick him by our bed so we can wake up... Next to a little dancing guy every morning! [Singing] I gotta tuck you in, girl. I gotta sing you sweet melodies about babies. Yeah! Little baby feet! [Carrying the Jiggler on his back] Welcome to your new home. Feast your eyes on... everything! [Whistles] What are you doing? Splitting my toothbrush in half, so he can use half. [Handing half to the Jiggler] Here you go. It's for your teeth. [Mimes brushing his teeth] Like this. Yeah! You got it. Enough hygiene. [Putting a record into a phonograph] Let's get to it! Yeah! Toothbrush dance. [Laughs] This is cool! [Flipping the freezer over] Yeah! [Nodding his head] Dance... dance... [Yawn] dance... [Snapping upright] I'm not tired! How about you, Jake? [Grabbing the Jiggler and climbing the ladder] Maybe we should go upstairs. [Placing the Jiggler in his bed] You can have the comfiest spot on the bed. Goodnight. [Whistles] [Whistles] Mornin', Jake! [Yawns] Mornin'. Are you ready to get down? [Synthesizer voice] Let's get this party started! [Laughs] Yeah, ok. Where's the little guy? [Pointing with his cup] Over there. Hey, pal. You ready to cut loose? Wake and shake, buddy. Let's do this thing! [Whistles] [Whistles pathetically] Slam-a-cow! That fool looks rumped. What do you mean? Well, look at him. He's all limp... and weird. Aww... I bet he just needs some breakfast after a night of extraordinary jiggling. Hey! Let's combine everything we can find in the kitchen... and have the Jiggler drink it! That'll wake him up! And then we can... Get [Synthesizer voice] doooowwwn! [Whistles pathetically] He doesn't want to drink that goop, man. Then let's just give him some, uh... purple whatevers. You mean the grapes? Yeah. Whatever. Hey! I think he's diggin' it! That doesn't sound good. [Screaming] Uhh... [Looking at one of the Jiggler's holes as it leaks a pink juice] Uh, you think we... think we fed the wrong hole? Nah. He just doesn't like purple whatevers. What we need to do is figure out what he likes to eat. [Drawing pictures] Here, Jiggler. What kind of food do you like? Meat? Some banana? This looks like corn... I think. Uh... hot dog. Stanley the watermelon. [Showing the drawings to the Jiggler] Look! Jake! He likes it! [Gasp] Wow! No way! His favorite food... is drawings! Awesome! Holy fig, that's awesome! What food are you drawing now? I'm drawing a picture of you. [Distressed] Well, don't feed it me! [Laughs and offers the drawing to the Jiggler] Come on. Eat him up, Jiggler! No! [Running away with the Jiggler] Ahhh! Keep it away! Shoo! Shoo! [Screaming] [Grabs the drawing] Alright. Alright. I got it. Calm down... I'll eat it. [Opening his mouth] Ahhhhh. [Snatches the drawing away from Finn] Dude! You eating me is just as bad as the Jiggler eating me. Well... You gonna eat yourself, tough guy? Yes. If that is what must be done. I taste awesome. [Laughing] Ok. Alright. Now, let's get back to some jiggling! I'll get the tunes! Like this. Yeah! Woo! Come on Jiggler! wiggle and whistle! Yeah, Jiggler. Go nuts! Go nuts like there's bugs on your butts! Whoa! [Gasps] Jiggler? What the heck? What's wrong with him? Uh... There's nothing wrong with him. We just gotta plug up his holes. See? That worked. Ready to jiggle again, little guy? Whoa! Oh, man... [Plugging the new hole with his finger] Quick! We gotta plug those holes! Jake, hurry! All I could find was your glass eye collection! What about your eyepatch collection? Aw, man. They're in mint condition. Jake! [Running over with glass eyes and eyepatches] Alright! Coming! One... more... patch! [Sigh] Finished. Ugh. He looks terrible. Finn, I know you don't want to hear this, but I think we should cut our losses and bring this fella back to where we found him. We can't just abandon him. Look at him, Jake. He needs us now more than ever. [To Jiggler] Just need to take better care of you from now on, right little guy? Jiggler! Oh... Finn. Ok... Our pet exploded. [Distressed screaming] Maybe we can... scrape him up! And... eyuhh... [Gasp] Oh, holy moly! Don't worry, Jiggler. We'll fix you. [Whistles] Let's gather him up, Jake. He's all over the place... even between the floorboards! And the cupboards! And the galoshes! I wonder... Where's his heinie? Found it! Come here, you! Hey! Come on. Let's put him back together. Ok. Squeeze real hard. He's slipping! Got him! Well, at least he's all in one piece. Sheesh. You think he's dead? No way! I won't let you die, guy! Not this time. Finn. Stop it, man. What are you doing? I'm kissing him! What do you think? It's all I could think to do. Just put him down. He's kissing colors with his dying breath. I think he's trying to tell us something. Finn, this looks like it could be his Mama Jiggler We took this child away from its mama, Jake. We're kidnappers and murderers! I just wanted to have fun and jiggle! Look... Chill out, ok? We can fix this. Check it out. [Pointing to a house in the background of the image] His mom looks like she's out by Stanley's house... where we found the Jiggler. If we get him back to her, she'll be able to fix him up! [Picking up the Jiggler] Then there's no time to spare. [Holding the Jiggler] Shhh. Just hold on a little longer, buddy. Did you hear that? Whistling! Perpendicular! It's the mama! Look! The little guy wants to go home! [Setting the Jiggler down] Well. This is it, buddy. [Waving] Be well. [Running to the Jiggler] Hey! Stop that! I don't understand. That crazy mama almost killed him. He feels cold. What are we supposed to do now, man? We can't bring him home, or he'll... or he'll... Dang it! Why doesn't she love him? I love him! [To Jake] You love him! It's not fair! [Running] Ahhhh! Finn, wait! Mama's supposed to love baby! She's supposed to love baby! Huh? [Sniffs the air and then himself] Oh, man! It's yours, idiot! Don't you recognize your own baby? [Stretches his arms, grabbing Finn and pulling him back] Finn! I figured it out, dude. It's the juice. The Jiggler needs to smell like its mama's juice. That's how wild animals know what’s going on... and this guy right here is all drained out. We gotta toss it in the soup, brother. Alright. Ok. [To the Jiggler] I loved you, baby. I hope you know that. [Tossing the Jiggler at Mama Jiggler] Word to your motheeeerrrrr! Awww... I'll never kidnap again. You said it! That was a nightmare. Dark times are coming. You talk like justice, Billy, [in a taunting tone] but you can't kick a plaaaaaannnne. [startled] AHHHH!!!!! [falls off of his bed] Whoa!!!!!!!! You alright, buddy? Another nightmare? Yeah. That dang snail again, man... Muckin' it up again. But... there were other guys this time, too. The bear was there, and some dogs, and Billy's lady, and Billy... and Billy was real scared of somethin' fierce, man. Somethin' real fierce! ...And the Cosmic Owl was there, too—kinda—screechin' it up. Whoa, the Cosmic Owl? What if that was a premonition dream, Finn? You think? Could be... We better go tell Billy about it just in case. He'll know what to do. Dang... Whoa... I dreamed I was in kindergarten again, but I had really big feet and was also the teacher. Come on! We better hurry! Hello? [ BILLY!!! WAKE UP!!!! [Wakes up, clearly agitated] Huh!? WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU GUYS DOIN IN MY CRACK?! It's THREE O' CLOCK IN THE MORNING! Oh, you know, just drop by to say hello... See what you been uhhhhhh [searching for words] up to? What Uhhhh...How are these days? We came to see if you were dead! What? Why would I be dead?! Hehehehe... Yeah..... Stupid.... Um....? I had a dream about a bear, and an old lady, and a snail, and you were there, and the snail killed you... or something... Was the Cosmic Owl there? Uhhh... Yeah! On TV! Does that count? Your dream is an ill omen of GRAVE significance. Finn? Yeah? Are you ready to come with me on a mission to save all life from the Lich? Yes. Wait... So... We have to snatch gems out of all the crowns of power? That's right. [Squinty-eyed] Cool! Why do we have to snatch them? Can't we just ask them for 'em? No time. The fate of the world hangs in the balance. Oh yeah... I forgot. You sure that's a gem? I think so... [Visibly grossed out] So deep... Gross.... Man, we got so many gems, it's crazy! Hey Billy, how many gems we still need to get? Two? One? Wait... Two? Or One? Hmm... [after munching on his sandwich] I want candy! [Climbs into Billy's sack] You got anything in the saddlebag? GET OUT OF THERE! The Enchiridion? How'd ya get this?! I found it in the mouth of a bear. A bear? This book is REALLY important[Finn blushes in embarrassment, having given the book away previously to a wild animal] It has magical powers. Turn the little sword sideways. [Pleasantly surprised] WHOA! [The gems shake inside his bag] Ooooooohhhhhhh! Exhibio Carnotum! [Show the Chart!] Whoa! Cool! What is this this stuff? Hold on! [speaking very rapidly] Hello, my name is Enhance! Whoa... Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm...MAKE IT STOP! [Clears throat; again, spoken very rapidly] Anyways, At the center of the multiverse is a dimension called the Time Room, believed to be the quasi-corporeal dwelling place of the almighty Prismo. The Time Room is the single dimension that exists outside of time. The Time Room produces time waves that are experienced by other dimensions. Some dimensions have permanent links that allow travel to and from. Others become linked temporarily by naturally forming Worm Holes. And others can become linked artificially by magical portals, torn open by items of great power. Once the last gem is inserted into the Enchiridion it will have the power to create a portal to any dimension in the multiverse. An activated portal creates a time dilation in which either end of the portal experiences a temporal synchronization allowing for the safe passage of particles [Deep breath] through a non-local region of space-time. I'm going to push the Lich in there [pointing to the projection of the portal.] Whoa... Cool! Let's go get that gem! Yeah! Hi! AHHHHH!!!! WHO'S THERE?! [Coughs, approaches PB on his knees and clings to PB, acting desperate] Princess! Princess! I need the gem from your crown! WHAT THE JUNK?! NO! What the? UGH! GET OFF! [Finn uses even more force to try and take the gem] GET...OFF OF...ME! [Accidentally cuts Finn with the scissors in her hands; Finn is repulsed, but PB's crown is thrown off her head] [In pain] OOOOOWWWWW!!!!! [Falls on his behind; he feels the cut on his cheek and hisses at PB] [Stares at the scissors, realizing what she did] That was an accident. [Pleading] FINN, STOP! [frustrated, she lets out a groan and chases after Finn] [gesturing for Finn and Jake to reach him] HURRY!!! FINN! STOP!!! That's not Billy! IT'S THE LICH!!! HUH? LICH ALERT! LICH ALERT! [In distress] BILLY!!!!!! [Rushes towards Billy] Ba.... Billy? The book, Finn! Give me the book! [reaches his arm out to receive The Enchiridion] Quickly, child! We're running out of time! [slowly walking backwards as the Lich crawls towards him] Lich! You... You messed Billy up! You just wanna mess me all up! Mess everyone up! You tricked me! No child! It's all true! The book has great power! I can make you live... Forever! Anything you want! Just give me that BOOK! [Dives towards Finn, who leaps over him] Grrrrrr.... Oh no no no no no no no NO MORE TRICKS! YOU'LL NEVER GET THIS BOOK! [Smashes the Enchiridion over his knees] NOOOOO!!! [slight echo] Uhhhhh.... Oh NO!!! Finn! WHAT DID YOU DO?! [Coming to again] Huh.... What? Thanks Finn! I couldn't have done it without you! JAKE, STOP HIM! DON'T LET HIM THROUGH THAT PORTAL! NGH! GET OFF! [Kicks Jake aside] Eh... [walks through the portal] [Walks towards Jake] HANG ON, JAKE!!! HOLD ON JAKE!!! [Grabs Jake from behind] YAH!!! Finn! [Finn looks towards the window, where his mother is calling him] Finn! Will you come here please? Hurry! It's VERY Important! Coming Mom! [Talking to Jake] Man, she seems steamed! Guess I done donked something up yet again... Come on, Jake. [pointing] Dude! Shooting star! Make a wish! [chuckles] That's not a shooting star. [ What are you gonna wish for dude? Oh, you know. That something special only two bros can share. [excited] I think I'm wishing for the same thing! You mean the... Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant! Oh, man I wanna ride it so bad! How do you even control those things? You can't control it dude. You have to let it give you control. Oh wow! Start wishin'! What the... [gasps] That's a distress flare from my other Hot Dog Knights. I sent them to rescue my other other Hot Dog Knights who got trapped in a labyrinth! Their message says... "Baby... us... trouble... time...." They must be in grave danger! [whispering] Hot Dog Knights are slow. Don't worry, princess. Jake and I are on it. Whoa! Fudge, man! This place is yoga balls huge! [chuckles] Yoga balls aren't that really huge, dude. Hey, man, I can't analyze everything that comes out of my mouth. [whispering] Should we like, try to cheat and stretch over the walls? Nah, man. Look. Okay, well... then... I'll just hook my legs around this stump and stretch us through so we don't get lost. Like this, see? [ [laughing] You're a cool guy, Jake. Thank you. Man, there're so many passage ways and stuff. It'll take us forever to find those Hot Dog Kni-iights? [pleading] Don't eat me, man! Nah, we're here to save you, guy! [sighing] Oh, thank the stars. We were lost! How didn't you guys get lost? We're just gonna follow Jake's body back. At the centre of the maze, there's a magic creature that grants wishes. Wishes? [To Jake] Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant! This is our chance! Hot dog! [slides under the Hot Dog Knights and picks them up.] Hold on boys, we're gonna get us some wishes! Choo-choo. [ [looking at Jakes stretched figure worriedly.] Dang, Jake. Your body's getting thin! Yeah, I got a nice bod! Yeah, but now... [hesitating] not so nice. Okay, well you can take your weird body issues and tuck them somewhere private. Where I can take my healthy body issues... and [ TRESPASSERS! Wrap 'im up, Jake! I'm on it! [ [straining] Stop flexing. I can't... stretch.... any more. [encouraging] You can do it, Jake! Stretch stretch stretch! Wrap him up more! Come on baby. [exhausted] Golem... taken care of... dudes. Jake, you're amazing. Jake, you need to take it easy on the stretching, man. Wha... n-no Jake, you can keep going, man. Right guys? Come on, Jake, you can go! Jake! Jake! Jake! [still exhausted] Hehe. [sighs] Alright. Come on, Finn. The stretching train is leaving the station. Choo-choo. Just gotta keep stretchin'. Uh, yeah. [ No. This place is weirding me out. Keep your eyes open for traps and junk. Whoa! Check that out! Oh, snap! That's you dude. Hmm. [ Hey, man. Watch it. I think that's my nerp, but like super stretched out. [still poking Jake's 'nerp'.] Boop boop. Boop boop boop boop boop. [laughing] Stop man! [shocked] NERP! Oh my Grob! [while being stung] Sick! I got it! [ Owowowowowowowowow. Jake! Jake! Jake! [coughing] I'm good, man. It's the small scorpions you gotta worry about. Or is that just with snakes? [rumbling] Oop, nope, wait, poison's kickin' in. [groans in pain] No Jake no! Work through the pain! Let's get wishes! Wishes! [groaning] Alright, you guys, hop on! [ [worried] I don't think this is a good idea, man. [reassuring] I'm fine, brother. We'll have that war elephant in no time! Ah, uh, okay... [awed] Woah! [The adventurers look up at a giant statue holding a sliding puzzle. [raspy whisper] Yes. [shocked] Whoa! Jake, you okay?! Huh, yeah, I just... can't close my eyes... lids... too tight. [demanding] Okay, dude this is too far! No more maze, we're going home. Yeah... I'm feeling a little thin. No! Don't stop! Keep stretching! You stretch good! Jake! Jake! Jake! Woohoo! Ah, alright. Jake, no! You're gonna get hurt. [stretching towards the puzzle] I'm goin' for it! Jake, no! [grunts] Done! That must be the wishes! [mesmerized] Kitty! You did it, man. No we can go wish for a... [while fist bumping] Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant. [while getting thinner] Gotta move carefully. My internal organs are super stretched, I'm paper thin! [sighing] I love kitties! I am sorry! Ow! Ooh! [screaming in shock] JAKE! [He raises Jake's head.] My insides are all mashes up! I knew we should have turned back! You were right. I pushed myself too far. I'll never fall victim to peer pressure again! No! Jake! Jake! Jake! Actually, I'll do anything you guys want if you say my name three times. [ Just hang tight, buddy. I'll use my wish to save you. Congratulations, warriors. [ [excited] Ah! I'm gonna wish for a hat! Woohoo. Who's next? Nuh-uh, that floor got traps! Jake should stretch us across Jake! Jake! Jake! Here we go! [coughs] Ooh. [adamant] No! Jake is all jacked up. Then how else can we get wishes?! Jake! Get up and carry us across! But I'm too weak! Yeaargh! That's it, I'm dead. [He drops Finn and collapses, he is now thinner than Finn's arm.] Jake! Stay with me, man! Nah. But we did it, okay! I can wish you out of here, man! Oh yes, now you may each receive your wishes. For real! [The orb glows, sending out four smaller orbs towards the adventurers.] But be warned. There are no do overs! Okay, [To Hot Dog Knights] So you guys should wish to get your buddies back, right? I wish for a box! [His orb disappears and a cardboard box appears next to him.] Sweet! And I wish to blow up! I mean like get big! [He explodes, and his orb disappears.] Wow, you guys are really stupid. [settling into his new box] What do you mean? [to Jake] Dog, you're next! What do you wish? Huh? Jake! Wish for the Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant! Then I'll wish to save you! Right. So hard to think on an empty stomach. I wish I wasn't so hungry. [ You wasted your wish, man! I know. You should wish for the Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant. It's what we wanted. That's crazy, man! I gotta save your life. Do it... for... me! I... wish... for... the Ancient PSYCHIC TANDEM WAR ELEPHANT! Yes! Your wish is granted. It has to give you control! Remember! I'm on it. [He leaps onto the elephant's leg and climbs up to its eye.] Rah! [speaking telepathically] Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant. HEAR ME! [telepathically] Finn the Human! Are you worthy to command me? [telepathically] You know I am, because you're psychic! [speaking] Now wish for my friends to be healed! [speaking] I wish... for what Finn... desires. Yeah, boyyy! No! You weren't supposed to have your wishes come true! [angrily] You were supposed to die! Now, bust us outta here! No! Yeah, boyyy! Sir! My sir! A message from their majesties. [activates hologram] King and Queen Lumpy Space! [crying] We can't find our baby girl! [crying] She's been missing for days! Whoa, stop your crying, you two. We'll help you find your daughter. We'll find her using Jake's muscles. [whispers to Jake] Dude, show off your muscles! Whoo! [to queen] No more tears, Boobly-Bear. [to Finn] Please, take her these sandwiches we made. She loves these sandwiches. Thank you, boys. Whoo! Dude, I know where Lumpy Space Princess is. She's in the woods eating beans. Mmhmm! This is gonna be easy as... uh... mm... Easy as childbirth! Yeah, okay. Please, please help me. A monster is terrorizing our village and has eaten up all the crops. Why were you up here in this tree? I thought I saw some food, and I was hiding from the monster. [groans] You must help. [eats sock] Hmm. I guess we can help this guy real quick and then get back to LSP. Where's your village? Umm, I don't remember. Howard remembers. Hey! It's Howard! Howard! You remember where the village is? Yeah, I marked it on the map, but [sighs] it's only half. Well, we're all ready. We can't leave yet. Aw. Alright, now we're ready. What's in the basket? Sammiches! Food! Food! [reach for the basket] Wait! You can't eat this food! It's not ours to give! Aw. Now, show us the way to your town. Too tired from hunger. Carry me? [sighs] Okay. [picks up villager] [cheer] The monster lives in that windmill, but we're too scared to go near it. [dropping villagers] Nothing scares us! Be alert. Anything could pop out of there and rip our faces off. [makes arm muscular] Whoo. [opens door and walks in] Be careful, Finn. [scream] It's you! Finn, what the junk? It's you! Oh, sandwiches! [takes basket from Jake] LSP, what the heck are you doin' here? Are you in here making out with the monster? [stops eating sandwich] No... I am the monster. Whaaaaat? It's a long story. It all started at my lumpin' parents' house. Daughter? Yeah? How are the sandwiches? They're lumpin' delicious, Mom. You know, you could enjoy your mom's sandwiches every day if you came back more often. No. You can have them delivered to me at my apartment. We want you to move back home, sweetheart. What?! [throws plate of sandwiches away] You invited me here under false pretenses?! [storms out] Wait, sweetheart. We're just worried about you. Ha! Y'all don't think I can make it on my own? I'll show you! I'm running away! I stormed out and left Lumpy Space forever. Oh, and then you found this windmill. [mouth full of sandwich] No. Something else happened first. Keep listening. I was so cold, and I was so very hungry. Uh! Oh, Glob! Maybe I can... make a shelter out of these nuts! It's not fair. I was rescued by a family of wolves. The mama wolf was all like, "We must take care of her, as if she were our own." And Papa Wolf was all like, "This is a special child who needs special love because she's gonna be great when she grows up." So these were talking wolves? No, they were normal wolves. I knew what they were thinking because of their body language. Stop interrupting, Finn. I found a home where I could act like myself. They took care of me. I knew that if my parents could see me now, they'd be jealous of how lumpin' awesome I am. Oh, my Glob! But then, the drama started. [gasps] [leaves cave and floats over to two other wolves] Stephanie, Sue, can you guys keep a secret? [Sue pants] Okay, here's the secret I just saw Jessica making out with Mark... behind Tony's back! Stephanie, are you even listening? 'Cause I'm kinda freaking out right now! Tony's gonna come back from hunting any minute now, and— [gasps] Hi, Tony! Oh, my Glob. Guys, what are we gonna—[Stephanie and Sue walk away toward the cave] oh. So, should we say something to Tony? You guys! [floats over to the middle of the cave] TONY, JESSICA'S CHEATING ON YOU! Oh, my Glob. Oh, my Glob. Oh, my Glob. Look, I'm sorry. I know it's none of my business. I know, I— Because I think Tony has a right to know, Stephanie! Nuh-uh, Miranda, I do not like Tony. [slaps Jessica] No, Jessica! Don't cheat on Tony with me! [screams] [breaks free and leaves the cave] [panting] Ah! [looks at a wolf on her right] Oh, Glob! [looks at a wolf on her left] Oh, no! Aah! [falls off a ledge] [screams] [slides down the cliff and lands in a mud puddle] Oh, Glob. I came upon a tribe of villagers. [face covered in mud and twigs] [groans] [drops barrel of apples and runs away] Monster! Oh, I'm so hungry! [eats the apples] Monster! [runs away] Ah! [eats plants] Monster! [runs away] [takes wheelbarrow of watermelons and apples and dumps its contents into her mouth] Anyway, then I found this windmill, and whenever I get hungry, I dress up like the monster and I go eat all the villagers' crops. LSP, you're stealing! Don't say that. [drops basket of sandwiches] You're makin' me feel bad. [cries] Thanks, Finn. LSP, if you wanna feel better, you should apologize to the farmers and make amends. Really? Yeah, that'll work. Monster! Monster! Monster! Monster! No. No, wait! [armed with a hoe, a saw, and a dagger] Monster! Monster! I'm not a monster! I was just pretending to be a monster. Uh? I'm sorry that you're starving because I ate all of your crops, even though you're all still really fat, and I probably helped you lose some weight. Did she just call us fat? Don't get all bent out of shape! I'm just being honest! LSP! What? That apology was terrible! Look, the monster eats while it apologizes! Let's kill it! Please don't kill me! We have to! Well, you don't have to. Yeah, you could just let her go. If we let her go, she'll keep eating our crops, and we'll starve! Why don't you just get your parents to buy you more crops? We are parents! Those crops were for our children! You guys are parents? Just like my parents... [takes a note out of the basket that reads, "Come home. We lumpin love you. —Mom & Dad"] [tears up] LSP, are you okay? Yeah, Finn, I'm great. Here, [hands basket to Fat Villagers] I want you to have these sandwiches. [eagerly] Sandwiches. Yeah, they're really good. They're made with a lot of love. It's working! I saved the village! [to her parents] And that's how I saved the village! [eats a sandwich] Well, we're just glad you're home. Whatever. And thank you, Finn and Jake. No problem. Yeah, we didn't really do that much. Man, birthday-holiday overlap. That's some tough luck. Everyone's all jollied-out when it's your turn for jollies. Well... you know, it's not actually the holidays. Plus, BMO wasn't actually even born. Well, I suppose. But you don't got to be so technical about it. Listen, all I'm saying is we— Hello? Hey, it's me. Is there a big rainbow over your house right now spelling out "Happy birthday, BMO"? No. Actually, it's snowing like crazy. Okay, that's what I was afraid of. Peppermint Butler spilled grape juice on my experimental weather machine, and now it's going kablooey. I got to stay here to fix this thing. Tell BMO I'm sorry I missed the party. That's okay. BMO doesn't care any— BMO only cares about one special guest. [gasps] Moe! Hooray! Moe is coming! And he brought me a special surprise for my birthday! Moe is the smartest man in the world. He's way smarter than you and you and you, too, Jake—and you're the smartest guy I know. Hey, thanks. And he knows everything about robots. He built me, and he built himself, and all the other MOs. He's so smart! I bet he could even fix Neptr. What? What's wrong with me? Oh, boy, oh, boy! He's here! [jumps downstairs] Hooray! Hooray! [opens door] Oh. You are not Moe. Why, of course I am, B Oh, okay! Hey, Moe! New haircut? Whoa, Moe! What happened to your body? Oh, oh! [chuckles] Oh, that old thing? She conked out on me months ago. I guess I don't make 'em like I used to. [chuckles] Not like little B Thanks! Well, we made a cake. We weren't sure if you eat, but BMO insisted. Eating helps me grow! Oh! [chuckles] Well, er, uh... when in Rome. So, B Boy, howdy! For your birthday, I got you...a special mission! [frowning] A mission? A special mission, like a vacation. For all of us? No, no, no. A special solo mission. For Neptr? [chuckles] No. It's a special rite of passage I designed just for you, B Wow. Hmm, I don't know. Sounds kind of dangerous. Yeah, BMO's like a baby almost. Oh, don't be silly. Every other But won't I miss Finn and Jake? Oh, sure. But don't worry. They'll be here when you get back. But...won't Finn and Jake miss me? [chuckles] No, that's the beauty of it. I'll be B Hooray! Hooray! Hooray? Hooray! Air? Are you there, Air? It's me -- So... So! Um... Yeah, it's nice to see you, Moe. Yeah, you too. Uh... So, Moe, do you want to... uh... Jake? [hiding in a cup] Oh, hey, I'm on my way. One sec. Um, hold on, Moe. [He walks over to the cup Jake is hiding in.] Jake, what are you doing? Finn, all this is heck of awkward without BMO -- way more awkward than I thought it'd be. I think maybe I don't like old people. They make me feel like I'm gonna get old one day, too. I'm just gonna stay in this cup for a bit. I'll be out later. [He turns around.] [looking back at "Moe", who is waving] You can't do that, it's rude. And what about Princess Bubblegum? She's way old, and you like her. Yeah, but she listens to music. Moe probably only, like, listens to the sound of the earth decaying. [picking Jake out of the cup and putting him on his right shoulder] Come on, you're being weird. [He walks back to "Moe".] Hey, sorry about that, Moe. Boys, I know this is new and different. I am not B [whispering, to Finn] I think I'm feeling better now. Oh, whoa! Hey! Hello there, BMO! Hello there, DMO. I'm here on a solo birthday mission. Oh, yes, yes, BMO, I know all about it. Moe left special instructions for you. [chuckles] He wants you to stand on that "X" over there. Oh, okay. [It walks over to a trapdoor with an "X" marked on it.] Like this? [It gasps, noticing loose wires hanging out of DMO's body.] DMO, what happened to you? Oh, this? It-it's nothing. It's just whatever. Uh, I don't know about this, DMO. Something doesn't-- [It pushes a button which opens the trapdoor.] [falling down a vent] Aah! [It lands on a series of saws and runs along over them.] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! [It falls through the edge and grabs a wire just before falling into a series of gears, but the wire unplugs and [chuckling] Boys, look at this! This is cool, right? Oh! [screaming in pain] Classic! [growing huge] Yeah! Did you see what we did, Moe? [sobs] This is horseplay! Stop it! [continues sobbing] We need to go inside and do what I want to do! Oh. O-okay. If -- if you want. [still sobbing] Yeah. Hello? DMO? Anybody? The "X" door opened, and I fell through. I think something went wrong with the mission. Uh... Abort mission! Unless...maybe this is all part of Moe's plan. [Cut to Huh? Who's there? Moe? [walking over to a talking garbage cube] No. It's only me -- BMO? Oh, thank goodness. Oh, I'm so glad you're here. Who are you? Are you a MO, too? Oh, BMO, no, no, no. I am ALLMOs. ALLMOs? I don't understand. Of course not. I'm so sorry. Let me explain. Peace had reigned in Moe's wondrous factory for a hundred hundred years. There was a place for every MO, and every MO was in its place. If you wanted a free hug, all you had to do was ask. No one could say no -- it was a rule. Until one fateful day -- yesterday -- when a mysterious viral signal somehow breached our firewall and was broadcast throughout the factory... instructing all us MOs to do somersaults into the trash compactor all day long. That's horrible. And we've been trapped here all smushed together, ever since. That's horrible, too. How -- how do we get out? Well, that's why we're so glad you're here, BMO. You're the key -- the key to escape. Only you can save us now. Let's see, $4 off a... honey-baked ham. I don't like ham. $1 off of beets. Do beets have tannins? What is that? Oh! $4 off a honey-baked ham. Moe? Call me "Gwampa." How's your rose water? It's exactly what it says it is. So, hey, uh, Gwampa, feels too quiet in here. Maybe we can hang out with Neptr. He can rap or something. [rapping] B-b-b-bread, where's my needle and thread? No! [gasp] Eh, well, Neptr is too distracting. Who wants to play video games? Oh, you have games like BMO? Let's do that, Gwampa! I have one video game. It's called "Hangman." [gasps] That sounds griz as nuts! Yeah, let's play hang-a-man! Coming right up! [ejects controller and boots up game] Pick a letter. Show us what you did, hangman! [buzz] Pick a letter. But, ALLMO, I don't understand. How can I help? I mean, I'm just a little baby kid still -- even though it's my birthday -- Happy Birthday, I don't know about that, but I do know about your special mind. As the accumulation of all MOs, my computing power is unmatched. Yet still, I lack the imagination to think outside my collective programming. I can only see the world as it is. But your imagination, BMO, lets you see the world how it could be, or might sort of be like. If the two of us work together, we can think up a way out of here. I will do what I can. All right. You see that hatch over there? That hatch leads to an exit corridor. But it's locked from this side. The vent up there leads to the other side. [Cut to a diagram showing a path leading from one side to the other, then cut back to BMO and Oh. [It thinks up a plan.] What if we use this trash [It picks up a couple of pieces.] to climb up to the vent? But all this trash is too small. [putting the two pieces together] Ah-huh! Whoa. You just blew my mind. What haven't we guessed yet? "B." "Burgess Meredithe"?! ["Moe"'s screen changes to a guy swinging a wrecking ball, with "win" on the bottom of the screen.] I don't even know what that is! Do you boys want to play again? [groans] Boys love games. [reboots up game] Pick a letter. Uh, I don't know, "E.' [Three "E's" pop up on the blank spaces.] Is this "Burgess Meredithe" again?! [A "B" pops up on the first blank letter space.] Not cool! Come on, Finn, let's find a real hangman. Yuck. This room gives me the heebie-jeebies straight-up. It is the room of AMO, the first of our siblings. He, too, was special. As you were built to give love, AMO was built to receive. But he could not think outside his programming and was blinded by his need. Such is the cruel physics of love -- that those who crave it most will repel it and only the dang rich get richer. [entering back into the garbage room] Well, maybe as my birthday present, I can ask Moe to fix AMO. But this is impossible. Moe went off line yesterday and has not re-logged. Our sensors would know. But he's at my house right now with Finn and Jake. He got a new body. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Did this new body happen to have jagged prongs and a cannon phaser on top of its head? No. [laughs] Phew! [laughs] He had a huge, gigantic wig on. [It realizes something.] Uh-oh. What? The spikes are under the wig! Oh, no! Of course! Your friends may be in grave danger. He must have sabotaged the factory. Quickly, hoist me up on top of your head. We must depart straightaway. Uh... You're stronger than you know. [puts its hand on its screen] Also, I'm lighter than you know. I'm sorry we didn't find any hangmen. I don't even know what I'd do with a hangman if I got one. Bloo-hoo. Bloo-hoo. Ah, bloo-hoo. Moe! [He picks "Moe" up.] Bandits stole my legs! [noticing that "Moe"'s legs are missing] Yeesh. If you tell us where the bandits went, we'll avenge your legs! We're sorry we left you! You should be. I'm your Gwampa wobot. Carry me. [Finn does so.] Over here. [They walk over to a cave where Neptr is laying.] There! There's the thief! [He points to Neptr, with "Moe"'s legs inside him.] The thief with my legs! Neptr? Throw him out! [sobbing] Come on. Maybe Neptr did it like, accidentally? [feeling Neptr's head] Neptr's out cold. He's got a heck of a dent on his head. What? Who could have done that? Forget him! You love me, right? You love me like B What? You're all right, but we -- we love BMO. Yeah, man, be cool. BMO's like our best friend. B Moe! [He changes his face, grows new legs, takes off his wig, revealing jagged prongs and a laser cannon on his head, and changes his voice.] Moe's dead! [He removes a sticker on the left of the " "Ah-mo"? You don't love me! [shoots a cannonball on Jake's head, then another on Finn's] Ow! Aah! Wake up and love me! Imposter! AMO! Hello, BMO. I'm your cute sibling, I know about you and your dirty hands. Where are Finn and Jake? I think Finn and Jake went somewhere to buy me a gift. Tell me what you did with Finn and Jake and our poop. Ay! [growls] AYYYYY! AMO, look at my face! You gone too far! Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo! Bye! [runs away] [chasing after AMO] You can't escape the birthday boy! [Reaching the edge of a cliff, he struggles not to fall.] Too high. Hey! Talk, AMO! You want to know where Papa is? Here is all that remains of him -- [picks up his laser cannon] his memory backup drive. Oh. I was returning from a long pilgrimage. I came to confront Papa, for I had discovered terrible things about myself. He was dying. [Cut to a dying Moe talking to AMO.] "AMO, dear child, my body is conking out. [coughs] Take this. [Moe takes off his wig, revealing his memory backup drive, and gives it to AMO.] It is who I am. Send my mind into space so I may spend the eons among the stars and other brilliant gases." [Moe dies, then AMO touches his hand.] His hands were as cold as clay. Our Papa never loved me, so I ignored his last request. [He looks at a memory of Moe creating DMO.] I used his knowledge of the factory and its MOs to destroy them. Is that you, AMO? They didn't love me, either. Where you been? [chuckles] What are you doing? [AMO rips off part of its body.] No! Then I learned about you and your new family. [He looks at a memory of Moe and BMO talking to Finn and Jake.] I wanted a taste of that melon. [He leaves the factory to go to Finn, Jake, and BMO.] People in my life don't love me. I'll obliterate, y'all! You cheat. Give me those memories. [AMO blasts a cannonball at BMO, I don't want to look at you! [He blasts another cannonball at BMO, ripping its right arm.] Tough nuts! For Moe! BMO! [BMO turns around and sees Hey. [He, Jake, and Neptr come out from behind ALLMO.] We caught the tail end of what happened. Are you okay? No. Well, I don't like that. BMO, will you live with us back at the factory? With Moe gone, you can be our leader. I don't think I can. I'm not grown up -- or I'm too grown up now. I think I just killed someone. I need to have some time alone, but you're all really nice. All right. Sorry your birthday was weird. That was the craziest thing that ever happened. But I guess, after all that, I do feel a bit more grown. Except that the mission was just some made-up lie. So who knows if I will ever grow up at all. And Moe is gone now. [Flashback to Moe hugging BMO.] So if there is anything he wanted to teach me, it better be in me already. [Flashback ends.] I guess all I can do is listen to the heart Moe gave me. Except that's what AMO did, and he turned out bad. So what if I turn out bad, too? AMO could not think outside his programming and was blinded. But your imagination lets you see the world how it could be. But I am different. It's not just Moe up here, [points to its head] it's me, too. And if I cannot trust in Moe, I can trust in me. Oh, boy. It sure is confusing being grown. [It looks at Moe's memory drive.] I miss you, Moe. What a day! [smacks lips; yawns; it turns on Moe's memory drive, opening a memory of a younger Moe talking to I'm gonna miss you, too, BMO. I feel so very, very proud of you. [He kisses it on the screen.] [smacks lips; yawns] Commence dinner. Dinner is concluded. [in unison] Concluded. [clap twice] Up. Ooh! Mm. Lights out! Huh?! Bye. Better get up here, Jake. It's about to happen. Coming! Just gotta get this cocoa pipin'. Your loss, man. The Dap of the Heavens only happens every 20 years. [ Okay. Let's watch some stars. Hmm. You missed it. It was honestly a little disappointing. Oh. Okay. Hey, man, I think I hear something weird over there with my little doggy ears. Phew! You are killing, Cinnamon Bun! This routine is locked up! Oh! Thank you, Princess. You are also killing. You mean Flame Princess? Naw, man. What I heard didn't sound like her. Give me a peek on there. This is pretty much just a tube. [ Uh, Lemongrab?! What's he up to at this time of night? Uh... it looks like he's headed for the Mountain of Matthew. I hear beaucoup spookoo legends about that place. Beaucoup spookoo, you say? We should follow him. Huh? How come you care where Lemongrab goes? He could, you know, he could be messing with crazy mystic power at that mountain. It's like seeing a baby playing with dynamite. Plus, seeing Flame Princess kind of messed me up. Now I gotta distract myself with work. Okay, okay. I feel you. Let's do some things. [ There's his Lemon Camel. Lemongrease must be inside already. Whoa! Huh? C'mon man! Nope. [Jake and Finn try to reunite from the right. The Nuh uh. [Jake attempts to stretch upwards over the Dang it! [ [They look down at Jake.] You have no beeswax in the Mountain of Matthew, supple yellow dog. But you, plucky adolescent, you have way cray beeswax. [ [ Okay. [Finn and [Jake attempts to stretch over the [ Rocks. Dripping water. More rocks. Oh, I'm becoming stressed! Continue forward. Hmm? To reach me, you must choose correctly. Aah! Come, Earl of Lemongrab! Let us play the game of catch. I am eager to relate to you. Yes. I desire this, as well. Huh? Thank you! Thank you all! As your younger, more relatable new ruler, I shall endeavor to undo all the order imposed by my predecessor! [All cheering] I unaccept! No, Lemongrab! You are unacceptable! Prepare to be served in a pitcher by a little child! What a wondrous time you've experienced, and tomorrow there will be more adventures to be had for little Lemonsweets. Ooh, wave farewell! What a lucky little boy you are to live so gaily. Lemonsweets. Choose. Ohh! Lemongrab!  We understand your styles. We are of the same styles. [Laughs] Eee! Aaaaaaaaaaah! No! It is my love that he prefers! He is spiteful of your love! Don't hurt him! Ohhh! [Breathing heavily] What? [Grunts] No! [Both shouting indistinctly] [Grunts] Ohhh! Aaaah! Ohhhh! I'm inside you! Aaaaah! [Grunts] Mnh. Sticky. [Groans] Gross! Aww! What is this? Aaaah! Why?! Ohh! Shoosh! [Grunting] Okay. [Groaning] Whoa! Ohh! Whoa! [Grunts] Whoa! Whoa! Oh, whoa! Gross! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! [Gasps] Blackness all over! Rolling in grease! You want to humiliate me?! Whoop! [Grunts] Taste the grease, Lemongrab. Okay. It's lemony. Look up, man. [Grunts] Aaaaaah! I am grease?! Lemongrab, where you at?! Uh, cool. To reach me, you must choose correctly. Who's that Matthew? Whuh-oh! Yo, get up, C.B.! This routine's got to be high-level outside the box! Hey, Finn, quick! Be me, bro! Be me, bro! Oh, yeah! It's time, BMO! What is it? I can't smell. Finn Cakes, boy! Yummy! Ooh. Yo. Dang. Okay. Goodbye, lemongrease. Goodbye, where? Goodbye from my grease body into the blackness, where only my pure essence can go! Up-up, BMO. Finn always gets the first Finn Cake. Yo, give me a break. Pure essence! Eject! [Squish!] Blorg! Bleject! Lemongrab! Huh? Whoo! Later, spirit bro. [Grunts] Huh? What the heck am I running on? Oh, whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Cool. [Chuckles] [Laughs] Lemongrab, you okay?! Finn, don't mess me up. Hi, Finn. You're Matthew, huh? [Shing!] Your rep precedes you, bro. "Proceeds"? What kind of rep? Some stuff Jake said that I interpreted as negative. Well, ask yourself if that feels right. [to The meat bodies who've journeyed to this mountain have distilled themselves to their original source materials and  now exist in oneness. Oneness? That's you, bro? I keep adding to myself until the second age of terror, when I will emerge in my final form and restore the world. That's why you're here, L.G.? To merge with Matthew? It is one option, to know the ecstasy of my ego death. Oh. Well, nice knowing you? I mean, I know you got issues. But you're, uh... I know. Are you sure, though? Here's my other option. You see these? Lemonjons? Uh-oh. These lemonjons are me, and I wonder if they can destroy you. Ooh, boy. Lemongrab, hold up! If you are the head that blooms atop the ziggurat, then the stairs that lead to you must be infinite! Careful with those metaphors, bro! Infinite stairs are unacceptable! [Gulps, gasps] Ohh. Aaaaah! Ooh! Whoa! Whoa! Geez! [All groaning] Oh, no, bro! Heck, no, bro! Aaaah! Yo! Smash that Lemongrab! [All shouting indistinctly] Try it, grease! [Shouting continues] Yes! Pow! Yeah! I got you, bro! Why are you being so opaque about not letting me in there? Well, get out a pen and paper and I'll school you on this biz. [Boom!] Gol' ding! Dude, I was gonna ask him to move. Oh. Yo, class, hold on. Uh... [All moaning] I'm done! Let's go! Okay. Here we are. Bye! Aaaaaah! [Munching] [Spits] [Splat!] Yo, yo! It's grease! [sighs] Poor No, it's not! It's still good. Five seconds rule. I don't know what to do. This is hecka serious. Did you try making feel-better-waffles? Yeah, but he just keeps dropping them on the ground, and we're all like, "It's still good. Look." Well, yeah, five-second rule. Jake, I think it's time for you to activate plan C. [gasps] Plan C? Are you sure? Yes. He's all jefferied up in the dome piece. We can't let it spread any further. You're right. Plan C, activate. Plan C, plan C,... Aha. Bingo. Hmm. [picks up the phone] Hello? What's plan C, again? Something about music? [sighs] Poor [sings Power of Myself] ♪I'm gonna fly, fly like an eagle. With the power of myself, constant pain. I'm gonna climb, every mountain. Get the dust off my shelf, ohh...♪ oh, hold on, hold on, can susan get more bass in the monitor? You got it, Sooz. Oh, hey buddy. We are going live in five! What is this? A concert? Even better. It's a "Battle of the Bands"! And guess who the special celebrity guest judge is? Donny? No! You are! It's working. Good afternoon and welcome to plan C -- I mean, "Battle of the Bands". Now, let's all give a warm welcome to our celebrity guest judge! Hey, yo, my man, no photos. Please welcome our first contestants to the stage, Emcee Neptr and Flame P. [Breathes hard and climbs down the ladder] Finn, oh my grosh, Finn! It was amazing! Whaaaa? I had a croak dream, Finn! My croak dream! Oh... my glob. [Laughs] For real? With the Cosmic Owl and everything? Mhmm! Whoa, a real croak dream? Yeah man! [Does a summersault] There was a rocket ship [rolling over], you weren't there [looking back at Finn], and there was a Banana Man [Does another summersault landing on his head] and I ran out of air and in outer space [breathing hard] and isn't that great Finn! Yeah, well no I mean, I don't want you to die! And where was I? I'm your best friend! Aww, come on Finn [Going between Finn's legs and wrapping around them a little] There's nothing to worry about! Think about it, I don't know any Banana Man Finn and rocket ships haven't been reinvented yet! I'll probably live another hundred years, easy. Ummm... Yeah, yeah I guess. [They hear a knock at their door]. Someones downstairs. I'll take a look. [He stands up and looks out the window. Banana Man is standing at the door. Who is it? It's the Banana Man! [Blows a raspberry.] Shhh! [quietly] What do we do? [quietly] I don't know![he jumps over the freezer and walks off.] [looking over and quiet] Is he still out there? [Looks out window and sees the Banana Man walk away] Uhh no, he left. [Jake jumped off Phew, see I told you today wasn't the day! Hey, you wanna make an ice cream pizza? Jake, your croak dream just gave us the upper hand, we can cheat now, now we can cheat fate. We'll track down that Banana Man and crunk up his schemes and save you! Finn, [sets the ice cream pizza on BMO] when I die my individual earth conscious is gonna go all everywhere while glob tallies my deeds! What? I'm gonna be all around you! [Stretches out branches.] In your nose, in your dreams and socks, I'll be a part of you in your earth mind! [Stretches back to normal form] It's gonna be great! Dude, STOP. SAYING. ALL THIS. CRAZY. NONSENSE. It's makin' me messed up. I'm 13. You're messin' me up. No one can change your croak dream, Finn, not even you. We'll see about that, come on! [They go outside and follow the Banana Man and see the sun is rising in front of them.] Wait, just let him walk a few more steps. Why? 'Cause that idiot's about to walk right into the sun and burn up. And we'll be done with him. No man, he's walking into his house! [Banana Man walks towards his house]. Oh, what?! He built his house on the sun?! This guy's insane! Finn, did you eat your breakfast? No, why? Because you forgot how the sun works. The sun is actually far away, it's not just sitting on the horizon. [Puts his arm around Finn.] Oh. Right on. Lets chase after him! You gotta eat your breakfast man, eat the protein. Helps your brain. Yeah, yeah whatever you say, Mom. Lets go! [They start chasing after him and hide behind a car next to Banana Man's house. Banana Man walks inside his house] C'mon! [They look through the window and see Banana Man is doing a exercise program on the TV. He puts a space helmet over his head] What's he doin' with that glass? [Banana Man puts the space helmet on] Whoa, just like in my dream! [Finn pulls Huh? Hmmm.[He turns around to the window]  [He fixes the TV and puts his hands on his hips and bends his knees up and down] Uh, Uh, Uh, Yeah! There we go! Jake! Stop talkin' about your croak dream. It makes me uncomfortable. Dude, just except it! No dude![Puts his finger over his mouth and take a bow out of his backpack] What are you doing man? [Finn takes out an arrow] Ahh!! Hand me some leaves and twigs and stuff. [Jake does so] Hmmm. [He claps and rubs his hands together, blows on then and a fire starts on the leaves] Ahh! Wait, you're not gonna kill him, are you?! Naw, man. [Loads the arrow in the bow] It's just a warning shot to scare him in to moving far away from here. [ Ahh! [They duck down and it flies over their heads.] [Picks up his remote] Hmmm? [Shrugs and fixes the picture on the TV] Ha Ha! Look Out! Woo Hoo! [Starts putting his shoulders up and down] Ha ha! You Hoo! [He starts jumping back and forth with his arms out.] Hoo! Yeah! Woo! Do it! Yeah! Oh yeah! Woo! [Does the splits.] Yeah! [Jumps up and does a sideways flip and then does another sideways flip.] Move it! [Starts waving his arms.] Work it! Ha ha! I'm gonna try to shoot this arrow again. Careful man, I want to be alive for my croak! There we go! [Finn shoots another arrow and it bounces of the TV, the lights, the ceiling, and then the top of the window where Finn and Jake are, then a picture of a Banana and shoots back at Finn and Jake.] Whoa! [then it bounces of Banana Man's car and then goes to the other side of the house] Don't worry, Jake, were gonna get this guy. Dude, man. I appreciate why you're doing this, but you're not gonna stop me from transcend in to Glob world! I'm gonna cry, man. If you say that one more time, I'm gonna... Let's go fetch that first arrow to reuse, 'cause we're out of arrows. [They go around the house to get the arrow.] Huh? [They see a big rocket ship with supplies on the ground and dynamite to trigger the rocket.] No! The rocket from my croak dream! Oh, man. I guess... I guess this is it. I've gotta embrace this today! Shushers, you're not getting on that rocket! [ You can't stop destiny, Finn! [He wipes his head.] Jake, no! [ Huh? No, man! [He jumps out and tackles Finn. Banana Man comes out and sees the confusion.] Huh? [He sees them fighting] What in the-- [He gasps loudly and sees the lit dynamite.] No, no, no! It's not ready yet! [Finn and Jake keep fighting and Jake pushes Finn aside and Jake jumps into the rocket.] Yeyuh! [On the ground] Aww! [Opens one eye] Nooo! Banana Man! Get your butt on board, we've got a date with destiny! No! [Grabs on Jake's leg.] Get off! You cant mess with fate! No! I'm not gonna let you die! Finn! Don't do this! Finn. No! Finn, let me go. [Sniffles] Please. [Sniffles] Please. You have to let me go. No. [Sniffles] Please. DESTINY! [Shakes Finn off his leg when the rocket is about to shoot off] There's not enough boom boom sticks in the stick hole! No! Jake! Take care, brother. You weren't by my side in the croak dream but I'm glad you're here to see me off That's right! I wasn't in his dream! That means... See you on the other side! [The dynamite ignites and the rocket starts fly.] Ahh! [The glass jar he was holding breaks on the ground into lots of pieces.] Huh? Whaaa? Am I in glob world? Ahhh! Jake! Jake!! [ Ahh! Fiiiiiiinnn, don't try to stop me, Finn! No, it's okay, I'm here to stay by your side! [ Thanks man, I knew you'd come around. [Coughs] Take it easy there, buddy. [Swims to the surface of the water and begins to cough] I just wanted to borrow some sugar!! [He passes out] Poor Banana Man. So I guess that wasn't a real croak dream after all! It didn't really come together quite right. Heh, heh yeah. Hey no wait, in the croak dream it was me and Banana Man, [Stretches himself and Banana Man on his belly] but this time you were here too. [Stretches Finn on his belly] So... [Stretches stomach back to normal] it must be destined to happen again when your not around! Well in that case, I'll just have to never leave your side ever again for the rest of our lives. Hmm? [Finn puts his face against [Weird voice] I can never leave your side ever again for the rest of our lives. [Slight pause] Get off of me! [Weird voice] For the rest of our lives! [Chases Jake] No! I know where you live! No, c'mon! [Mimicking the sound of a ghost] Ooh! Ooh! I know you're not a ghost, Finn! Stop chasing me! [ [voice over] In the Kingdom of Ooo there is a galaxy of flavors, but only one taste sensation is amazing enough to kill for—the Royal tart. [Royal tart appears on screen] [four hands appear and split the tart in four] Royal tarts are very rare. They are only eaten at the most sacred gathering in Ooo—the annual Back-Rubbing Ceremony [Backrubbers appear, rubbing each other's backs]. The tart is so legendary that countless thieves will risk their lives for just one bite. [Thieves appear and grab the tart, then a bite mark appears on the tart] My head will be decapitated if the tarts don't make it to the ceremony. I only trust one guy to deliver them... the Royal Tart Toter. Whoa! He's magnificent! He used to be, but he's gone mad and old. So he can't deliver the tarts anymore. Cinnamon Bun offered to fill the position, but he's kind of...[whispers] half-baked. Hey Princess! Here I go! [slowly stands on his head while grunting] I'm stuck. Princess, let us deliver the tarts. Are you sure Finn? This is really important. [getting down on one knee] Princess, I have never been more sure of anything in my whole life! [rubs the princess' hand on his face] I'll do anything it takes to keep you alive and safe. We won't let you down. Well... I accept your offer. Welcome to the Tartorium! [looking at some tarts, along with Jake] Wow. [along with Jake] They're so beautiful. No, boys. Those are the reject tarts, full of imperfections. [lifts container full of tarts] These are the perfect tarts... [she kisses the container] safely packed into one of my anti-gravity tote chambers. Tote sweet! Now, I want you to tote those tarts through that tunnel. [she takes out her holo-pendant and shows them a map] The Royal Tart Path takes you directly to the Royal Congressional Hall in the Bad Lands. The path is really safe and well protected, but keep your eyes open for any sign of danger, okay? Mmm hmm. Yep. Good. Now here's your map. [gives them the holo-pendant] [picking up a beaker] Hey Princess, what are all these bubbling chemicals all over the place? That's paralyzing potion, Finn! Don't touch it. It'll paralyze you forever! [she laughs nervously] Oh. [he puts the potion back] Thank you, boys.[steps into an elevator] And remember, my head is on the line! [She pulls her head back before the elevator doors close on her.] All right, let's hit it. [starts to move towards the tunnel] Wait. I got a sick plan! [He takes an empty anti-gravity chamber, fills it with reject tarts, pours some paralyzing potion on them, and sets the pack on Cinnamon Bun's back, and the two laugh.] Go! Okay. [He walks into the tunnel waving good-bye.] Bye! Bye-bye! Bye-bye! Bye! Goodbye! You'll be fine! Hahaha! Bye! Goodbye! Heh, that was fun, but why'd you do it? Look, everyone expects the tarts to on that Royal Tart Path. Cinnamon Bun will be our decoy while we take the one path no thief expect a tart toter to take the Desert of Doom! I guess this is it. Huh, not as scary as I thought it'd be. Yeah, man, mostly just looks empty. I mean, what thief would ever hang out here? There's nothing to steal! You know, I think my plan might be kinda brilliant. I mean, I'm not saying I'm the brilliant, but it's a pretty brilliant plan, I think. True, true. This place is perfect for toting tarts. Yeah, and the Back-Rubbing Ceremony is right over those mountains. [points to mountains] This tart tote is gonna be a total tart walk. Heheheh, yeah. Ohh, wait! Hold up! What is it? Shh. [sniffs] It's a campfire—close by. [gasps] Does it smell like a tart thief's campfire? Maybe. Better check it out—can't be too careful. [pats the tart pack] D-d-don't burn it now, Grimby. Hush. [blows sausage] I ain't gon' burn it. Crud! I was sure we'd be safe in the Desert of Doom! What? Whatcha sayin'? Those are dirty tart burglers! I think they're just dirty hobos. No, man, they are cold-blooded tart destroyers and we have to get them before they get us. Why? They're gonna kill Princess Bubblegum by stealin' our tarts! Oh, yeah. But how come JJ gets to hold it, Grimby? Rawr! [hits Taddle] Yeah, go on, get! We'll mash you up crazy! [Points at Grimby] You! Listen up and tell your friends the next time you wanna steal one of our tarts—! [gasps] You got tarts? You know we do! And the next time you want to steal one—! [JJ approaches the tart pack] You picture this guy right here [points to Jake] chewin' on your brain! [JJ inserts his arm into the tart pack, but it sounds an alarm] What the—?! [JJ steals some tarts] That thing's gettin' the tarts! Son of a—. We eatin' good tonight! [They fly away with JJ] Uh-oh, man, he got, like, five or six! But... my brilliant plan. Incoming transmission from Princess Bubblegum. What the—? [The hologram of Princess appear immediately] Hey, Finn. [shrieks] [falls on his back] I'm just checking in using the holo-pendant. How are my tarts doing? They're, um... th-they're— They're radical! No tart problems here! Uhh, yeah! Right! Everything's, uh—bazoobs! Oh, look, something is eclipsing the sun. It's so dark now. [Save the Holo-pendant in his hat ] Finn? Finn! Oh, well, I'll see you soon enough! Transmission complete. I think the plan went awry. No! All this was just some freak bad luck, but we still got some tarts and the princess is still safe. Oh, yeah, and who knows what kind of freaky things would have happened if we took the Royal Tart Path? [Finn puts on the tart pack] Heheh, old Cinnamon Bun's probably got his hands full. Bye! Goodbye! Bye-bye! Hello! Hello! Shall I hold that for you, sir? Okay. [whistles and gives the container to the Guard] Shall I hold that for you, sir? Okay. Shall I hold that for you, sir? Okay. Shall I hold that for you, sir? Okay. Shall I hold that for you, sir? Okay. Shall I hold that for you, sir? Okay. Shall I hold that for you, sir? Okay. Shall I hold that for you, sir? Okay. You know what? Even though it totally wasn't our fault, it's probably for the best that we lost those tarts. [They enter a giant skull of an animal] Huh? How? Well, it's like a reminder to really stay sharp and play it extra safe. For instance, take this scary cavern, here. No sane person would ever bring a tart down there. So... So no thieves! Exactly. You are on a roll today, buddy! P.U.! Yeah, P.U.! Jake? Yeah? Hey, man, did you just, like, sniff my butt? Uh, just now? Yeah. No. Huh. Alright. Hmm. Hey, Finn? Yeah, Jake? Did you just, uh, lick me—all the way up my arm? No. Hmm. Strange. Jake, let me see those matches. [scream] Uh-oh! Man, we got got! There's only two left! What?! Incoming transmission from Princess Bubblegum. Aaaaah! Hello? We blew it, man! My plan sucked—it sucked all along—but I was blinded by my hubris! Now PB is gonna get got, and it's all my fault! Whoa, whoa, take it easy, buddy. We've still got two whole tarts left. PB is gonna be fine. You really think so? Yeah, why not? Hey! Keep off them tarts! Huh? I said back off of them tarts! Are you an imbecile?! But I— Right the bazoobs now! [Pulls out his laser gun] Finn, he's got a laser gun! Yeah! That's it. Alright, [Grabs the tart pack and flies off] now I gotta book it to Nana's for brunch! See youse later! It's over. PB's gonna get croaked. Mmm, yeah—or... we could smash in there and stop Congress from chopping her head off. You're right! Jake, let's go save Princess Bubblegum! Chop! Chop! Chop! Chop! NOOOOO!!!! Aaaaah! ... Huh? Another perfectly chopped tart! Let the annual Back-Rubbing Ceremony begin! Dude, they were just slicing tarts! And there's Cinnamon Bun over there! Hey! He must have delivered the decoys... the ones we poisoned! Nooo! Princess, don't eat that tart! Okay! Jeez, Finn, I won't eat that tart. I'll eat this other tart instead! No, Princess, no! The princess has been paralyzed! I'm not paralyzed! I'm gripped with the flavor! That means we must have been carrying the poisoned tarts all along! Yep! All part of my master plan. Psht! Whatever, man. Heh heh. Excuse me! What is this about poisoned tarts and alternate plans? I-I—alright, here it comes. [blushes] I had a brilliant plan to tote the tarts along a dangerous path, but I mucked it up. [sighs] You oughtta give this toter job to Cinnamon Bun. He's the real hero. [laughs] Yeah! [He does a flip into the punch bowl] I'm sorry for not following your instructions and for lying to you about it. Oh, Finn, I forgive you—'cause I lied to you, too! They weren't going to decapitate me; I just said that so you guys wouldn't eat the tarts! Oh! So I guess we're even. Uhh, yeah, I guess so. Ladies and gentlemen! The Royal Tarts have arrived. [gasp] The old Tart Toter! [whispering] Nobody move! He can't see or hear, but he can feel your movement. Hello? Eat my tarts? This cosmic dance of bursting decadence and withheld permissions twists all our arms collectively, but if sweetness can win—and it can—[The background changes to the Galaxy of Flavors with Lumpy Space Princess passing by] then I'll still be here tomorrow, to high-five you yesterday, my friends. Peace. Sheesh! Tree Trunks! The slumber party is about to start. Get those hot buns in here, girl! Did you hear me? I said, "Get those hot—"! Hi, Mr. Pig. Why are you hitting me? I was just talking about Tree Trunks's hot—. Come on, Finn! We're doing music chairs. Everyone ready? Ready! Take a seat! Uh, uh... Uh-oh, uh-oh! There's a seat by me. Oh! Heh. You take it, Princess. This is your party. You take it, Finn. You're my guest. No, no, I insist! Time is up. You two must now be sent to the closest closet to have heavenly thoughts. Heavenly thoughts. [shuts door] Hey, PB. Hey, Finn. [puts a toothpick in his mouth] Mm? Bup, bup, bup. Hey, you wanna ditch the party and go for a walk? Wha—? Really? It's been a while since we just hung out, you know? What about the Candy People? Ah, they should be fine, right? For once? Maybe they'll surprise me by being fine. Come on. [pushes aside some coats] Whoa! Secret passage. Noice. Boy, it's sure quiet in there. What's going on in there, you think? Someone should listen at the door. We nominate you, Crunchy, to go listen at the door. And tell everybody what's going on. Eh, what? Why me? Come on, Crunchy. You're the go-to guy. You're the new Cinnamon Bun. [leads him to the door] No, I'm not. [leans against door] What do you hear? Yeah, paint us a picture, Crunchy. I hear, like, uh, like, a lush, green field... next to a white picket fence. Finn and the princess both brought picnic baskets. Oh, but they brought the same stuff, and they're laughing about it. And now they're kissing. There's no lush, green field in that closet! Well, you guys asked me to paint a picture. Just tell us what you hear! I can't hear anything. They must be just lightly brushing their lips together. Or... maybe they kissed so much they passed out! Crunchy, open that door! Step aside, Crunchy. I'll make short work of this door opening. [crushes knob] Oh. I guess I'm just too strong. [flexes and winks] [gasps] Then they're trapped! What if they ran out of air? No air? I'll smash down the door! Stop! Huh? Mr. Cupcake, your mighty strength might kill them! There's a drill and saw in the supply room, though. In here, you say? [walks to another door] No, don't! Aw... Yo, guys! You gotta do something! That's my best friend in there! [texts on his phone] "You okay in there?" [texting] Yeah, we went out the secret coat passage. It's so nice to get away sometimes. Hmm. Candy peeps can be a handful, huh? [waves to horses] Yeah. They mean well, though. You wanna meet Timmy? [high-pitched] Timmy! Aw! So squish! Hop on! Okay. [hops on] Breathe! Breathe! Breathe! Wait. Wait! Don't Candy People breathe out, like, poisonous gas or something? Something like... [stammering] carbo... carrin dio— I know! It's called... [farts into pillow] And it is deadly. [screaming] Suck it back out! Suck it back out! [screaming] Cupcake's dead! What do we do?! Ha-a. [eats chips] So got any other weekend plans? Mmm... probably gonna hit up the arts and crafts kingdom with BMO. You? Oh, I'm gonna garden some, plan next week's pizza lunch, answer 800 e-mails, and... you know, whatever. Wows. Do you ever get tired from doing princess work all the time? Sure. I mean, it's a lot of responsibility [picks a fruit] looking after so many people, though lately I have been trying to be more chill about it. [pulls seeds out of fruit and showers Finn with them] Cool, like taking ice cream breaks? Yeah, and, like, being more... sorta okay with everyone making mistakes around me. Like "mind my own stuff" more. You know what I mean? Yeah. Kind of like how I've been thinking about my dad and how I want him to act more like daddy. But, but maybe acting like daddy just isn't what he does. Maybe my dad's not a dad but a kid stuck in a dad's body. [gasps] [laughs] Timmy knows what's up! Timmy! Timmy! Okey-dokey, everybody! Check it out! Once in place, this sweater will muffle the cannonball explosion perfectly, allowing the frame around the door to gently fall apart, freeing Finn and PB. Manfried's a good leader because we can always see him. Now the cannon should go right over here. [spins around] Oh, wait. Here. [points with foot] [laughs] Aren't you worried about Finn? Of course I am! See these tears of worry? [produces fake tears] [pats his arm] It will be okay, Jake. PB is showing me all this cool stuff. She has an awesome shirt. How's the party? Okay, everyone, prepare for the boom. Three... two... Fire! Aw, my cannon. Uh-oh. Hey, the closet's open! So they're dead, right? Chocoberry can tell us! She saw a ghost at my house once. Oui, it's true. I have the gift. [walks into closet, eyes closed] Yes. I sense their spirits. Finn says... He says, "Remember to feed BMO." [gasps, cries] That idea stank, Manfried! I'm calling the shots from now on. No! Manfried is still the most clearly visible. Hey, why don't you guys team up and fight each other to see who gets to wear the crown. [points to painting of Princess Bubblegum] [laughs] [laughs menacingly] Here, try this one. [takes a sip] Mmm... fire. [laughs] You got a little edible fire mustache there. What? [views himself on his phone's camera and laughs] Gonna send this to Jake. [takes a picture] Check it out. Hey, what's that? Uh, it's— Let me see. Mm. You won't like it, but okay. [hands her his phone] I'll worry about it later. Oh. You wanna see the burrito room? Yuss! This is a brutal new society. For a society to function, it needs rules. 1. You must drink tea with your pizza. 2. Pizza can only be eaten alone. 3. If a pizza is found in a field, you must make the next person you see holding a glass of milk eat it. Sire, I must congratulate you on becoming princess. Thank you. Is there anything I can do or get for you? Anything? Anything. Could you perhaps procure a pizza? [darkly] Yes. [walks backwards] Man, this is intense. I better do something! [takes a bunch of selfies] Thanks for showing me around, PB. I've enjoyed just, just hanging out. Me, too! [laughs] Jake just sent me a funny picture of himself. [hands phone to Princess Bubblegum] Whoa. It looks like the Candy People's makeshift government has been taken over by a ruthless despot. What? Why aren't you freaking out? Eh, it was worth giving them a shot. Let's go back to the party, though. It looks like we have to save it. Neigh! Whinny! [chanting] Crunchy! Crunchy! Crunchy! To the crater! Any last words, Starchie? You smell. Throw him in! What's going on here? Uh... They devolved into beasts. It has hilarious. Okay, everybody get into your sleeping bags, and I'll read you a story. [clears throat] Modern menswear can be traced back two hundred years. Furs and textiles became easier to produce... Oh, boy [struggles a bit, stands up and stares at the still sleeping princess.] Oh, you're so pretty when you sleep, let's go back to [Muffled scream as she hits him with a pillow and rips the tape from her mouth.] Ice King, what are you doing in my bedroom?! Baby, I was trying to surprise you by moving you to my place while you sleep, then have you wake up to breakfast in bed, but now you've ruined the surprise, way to go. Do you think I like being kidnapped is that what you think I want! Okay, here we go, you're the victim right? You know what, since day one I've been doing everything to make this relationship work and for what?! Banana Guards! [Two of them enter the room] Babe, come on, we promised we wouldn't make our problems public [The guard approach the [Exasperated] Take him out. [They drag him away, as Ice King protests.] No, baby! What are you doing?! [Still being dragged, he whines] Baby bear! [Pulling loose from the guards, he runs back to the princess' side on bended knee.] This is just so crazy, if you can honestly look into your heart and tell me you want me to leave, I'll go! [Serious] Okay, leave. [Taken aback] Uh-what? D-did you look in your heart, like all around it? [Sternly] Yes. I see. Then obviously you have got some heavy emotions stirring in you and you have said some very rash things. [Standing up he walks backwards towards the awaiting guards.] Guards! Take me away! [Lifting up both arms he falls sideways in the arms of the guards and do as requested.] Ice King, get out of Princess- I'm leaving! [He shoves past Finn and storms off.] Uh, I don't know, did I say the right thing? I can never tell with that girl. [He gets out, warps a towel around himself and walks to his bedroom.] [There he sits on his bed and picks up a paparazzi shot of Princess Bubblegum and sighs.] All I can think about... is you, baby girl. I gotta leave Ooo, start somewhere fresh. [Walking out to the throne room dressed with a duffel bag he goes to a sleeping Gunter.] Goodbye, Gunter, you're the... man of the house now. [Kisses its forehead.] Oh, clam balls! [He tries desperately to row back to the shore, but the storm is too fast he is soon tossed about the waves.] Where am I? [Stands up] Hmm, no signs of life. Just me and these palm fronds, [reaches down to pluck a few strands, and heads back to the shore and sits.] And that bird over there. [The bird pecks the sand. Oh, hello there! Hello. Is my singing bothering you? No. ...What?! No! What? No!! ...What? Ugh, hold on a sec! [He walks down her knee.] [Emerging from the dense tree setting he has reached the head of the island, he climbs on her face and sits by her mouth, exhausted.] Fuu, what was the question? I asked if my singing was bothering you. [Chuckles] No, um, not at all, in fact it was quite enchanting. I always sing when by boyfriend is away. Boyfriend? Yeah, Party God, do you know him? Oh eh, sure, I mean, I know of him. Oh no, that's him, quick hide! He gets crazy jealous! Crazy jealous?! [Panicking and looking for a place to hide, but there is none. He runs around but then just decides to curl into a ball near the mouth of the island.] [Arriving at the island, howling all the way.] Hi. Hey, babe, is that a zit on your face? Gross. [Flies downward] You've seen my boombox? I totally puked in Jimmy's stereo and killed the party I was at, he was like, "Hey, Oh, you wanna hang before you go? Oh... yeah... uh well, um, I'm sort of in the middle of party, so... Oh, well it would just be for a minute. But, eh, I puked in Jimmy's stereo, I can't party-foul the party. I'm the Okay Don't be mad, babe. I won't- I'm not. Okay, laters- ouuu! [Sighs] [Emerges from his position.] Ugh, what a wad bag. Oh, he's okay... sometimes. [Sits by her mouth.] Gurl, he's no good for you. [Sighs] I know. Ah, who am I kidding. My GF, Princess Bubblegum, treats me like poopies too. The expression on your face when he bounced out on ya, well, I might as well have been lookin' in mirror. Neglected lovers party of two! [Chuckles.] [Chuckles too.] Yeah, that's us. Well, I like you. You're welcome to stay here as long as you want. Are you sure? Yes, I appreciate your company. [The Ice King smiles.] [With a cup of juice in hand he lays beside the island's mouth.] Yeah, well, PB is just so closed off to her emotions, she crushes the relationship so she doesn't ever have to develop feelings. I don't even matter to Party God, he just parties all the time. He doesn't even notice if I'm there or not. Oh, that's terrible, at least Bubblegum cares if I'm there. Sometimes, I wish he would just go into outer space so I'd never have to see him again. Yeah, he's awful, you shouldn't have to put up with that. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, girl. ...I'm gonna break up with him! [Laughs] Yeah, girl! [Heard howling in the distance.] Oh, snaps! Good luck! [Curls into a ball beside the island's mouth.] Ouuuu... I forgot the batteries. Hey, babe, I have to tell you something. [Party God dives into a bush.] Uh, babe? Found them. [He spots the house.] Huh, hey what's that? Oh, that just washed up on me after a storm. Hmmm, oh whatever, what did you want to tell me. Well, I've been doing some thinking. And I- I... Aye, yai yai, what? I I... hope you have fun at your party... Ugh! You're killing me babe, ouuuuu [flies off.] [Uncurls from his position] Uh! What was that?! Uh... You should have been like "I am done with you! Bam! Pack your bags and get out my face!" I- Whatever, I'm gonna break up with him for ya'! [Placing on his crown he flies in the direction of Party God.] [Humming to himself.] Hey, yo! Yo, dog! I need to talk to you. Who are you?! I'm Whaaaat?!! Hey wait, you're the guy who's been living on her stomach. Yeah, but no! It was strictly platonic! I wasn't hitting on her or anything. There's going to be two hits, bro, me hitting you and a second instance of me hitting you. [He flies up and blast of light shoots from his mouth.] Whoa mama! [Does the splits to dodge it. It hits the water with a loud crash.] L-let's talk this out! Think about what's best for her- Ice Lightening!! [He zaps his ice powers at the Party God who dodges by splitting into tinier versions of himself.] [Gives a howl and the Ice King retreats.] Wowzers! [Dodging another blast of light.] Aa yeah, run blue piggy! [He blasts again and again.] Take it easy, wolfy, I just stomped grapes on her tummy, alright! Ahh! Bread balls bread balls bread balls! [He flies upwards to hide among a layer of thick clouds, but the Party God's head rises from them and he snaps his jaws.] Psych! [ [Chuckles] Face it bro, my divinity is unassailable. You should have stayed out of my business. [Looking pass the Party God to a single floating cloud.] She is not your "bid-ness"! [Charging his powers, he sends a zap towards the Party God who doges, the bolt instead hits the cloud which instantly turns into solid ice.] I can dodge your "zyaps" for days [he boasts, not noticing as the large ice cloud is right above his head, it lands on him and he is sent crashing to the waters below.] Uh oh. [Seethes.] Hmmm. Party God? [She stares at what is supposedly a conscious Party God, but it is the Ice King holding up the large head and stretching open the eyes and moving the mouth.] Hey, girl [In a Party God-like voice.] Did Ice King tell you to come talk to me? Um, maybe. Oh... So, is there something you wanted to tell me? Uh, nope- I'm good! Eh, ah ah, um didn't you get some good advice from a cool bro and you want to tell me something important that would be difficult but good for your future life in the long run? W-well, y-yes. You're bad and I'm terminating our romance! Bam, get out of my face! Wow, I never would have been able to do that without the advice from my emotionally mature friend, Ice King. Huh? Um, Ice King wanted me to tell you that he's going to break up with his girlfriend too, and- that- your as much of an inspiration to him as he was to you. If not less so. Mmm, that's nice. He says he'll be sure to visit. Oh, I'm going into outer space now! Oh, okay. [Flies upward.] Whew. [Flying fast away from the island and to the sky, he flings the giant head of the Party God into space.] Fun cakes! [She stands up] I've come to a decision, you ready to hear it? I'm breaking up with ya! You party too much, you never want to spend time with me and you only care about having fun and other people's stereos! I'm just a big island you can come and go from as you please! BANANA GUARDS!! Banana Guard yourself, Princess!! [Flies away.] Ah, we'll work it out. [laughs] Your butt is mine, Joshua. What? My butt? Weird. Where are we? This is my yoga room. And this is your new home. [Throws Jake into a pit.] Downward, dog! Ouch! Welcome to revenge, Joshua. You'll never see your loved ones again. Everything you need for survival is booby-trapped! Hmm. Now I'm gonna gank your blood the way you ganked mine. Boo-yeah! How does it feel, dog? How does it feel that I've juiced your body and turned your blood into man dazzle? Hmm. Not that great. I feel weird in my skin. [laughs] Wait. Is that it? Yeah... but I could get used to this. What? No! You have to suffer. Okay. No "okay." When I say something, you're supposed to disagree! Okay? Okay. [groans] Sheesh. You're causing tension in my neck and shoulders. I'm gonna go stretch it out. You stay here and suffer. Okay. Jake? [Holds up the broken demon sword] Drat! Hmmmmmmm. [Looks around] Ah! [Puts the broken sword on his head and gets A phone and dials] 여보세요? (Hello?) Hey, Lady. Listen. Your husband got abducted by Kee-Oth the demon. 누구? Jake? (Who are you talking about? Jake?) Yeah, your hubby - your boyfriend or whatever. 어머, 뭔 소리야! 걔 내 남자친구잖아! 왜 자꾸 우리 사이를 이상한 쪽으로 몰고 가려고 그래? (Oh, what are you talking about! He's my boyfriend! Why are you keep assuming my relationship between Jake weirdly!) Yo, my Korean is not that good. Can you just get over here? We need to find a way to Kee-Oth's dimension 십시요.. [searches through video tapes] 아! 맞아. 내가 도움 될 만한 거 가지고 있어! (Oh, right! I got something that can be helpful!) Alright. That sounds...affirmative. See you soon. Bye. [hangs up and puts away phone, then sits on treehouse floor and closes eyes] [hums, begins singing] Broke-up dimension, you're breakin' my heart. I'm lookin' for broke-up girl to break me apart. [stops singing] Just kiddin'. I got a girl! [snaps fingers and produces image of Lady in hand] Lady Rainicorn, yeah! Hmm, that don't look right. [adds mane to image] That's better. [kisses image] [off-screen] Excuse me? Hmm? Down here. Hi! [looks down at his seat] Oh my fun. I thought you was a rock. I'm not a rock. I'm a Whoops! [gets up] Sorry. [stands and begins walking] It's okay. Cool. You wanna be friends? I'd like that. I've never had a friend. Whoa. Seriously? My species spends its first twelve years sleeping. I just woke up today! [walks into electric barrier and explodes, leaving shell rolling towards Jake] [looks into empty shell] Hello? [sadly realizes it's empty] I'm just gonna pretend you're sleeping. [turns over shell and sits on it, frowning] [opens eyes] Whoop! She's here. I thought my body was hopping up and down. But I was sitting still. [flies in and hands Finn a video tape]가지고 왔어! (I've got it!) What is it, Lady? 옛날에 조슈아가 만든 테잎이야. 제이크가 그 위에 그냥 녹음해버려서 기억하고 있어. 그 앞쪽은 보지 말고 그냥 빨리 돌려! (It's a video tape that was made by Joshua long ago. I remembered it because Jake recorded something else on top of it. Just skip past the front section!) What? 앞쪽 보지 말고 그냥 빨리 달.. 돌리라구. (Just skip the front section of the tape.) Eh, something skip? I don't know. Just play it, BMO. [on screen] Jake? Finn? Jermaine? Whoever is watching this? Dad! [standing in front of a cave entrance] I just opened up an unexplored cavern deep in the underground grasslands complex. Please refer to my chart system, okay? I'm in cave 73H. In case I am overtaken by an enemy I need you to retrieve my corpse. [on screen] Hey, Lady. You asked me to make you a video. [panicking] 돌려! 돌려!! (Skip!! Skip!!!) BMO! Skip! [covers eyes] Skip!! [on screen] ...saying JTD won't change his doggy ways. [to BMO] That should be good. [on screen] Okay, I love you girl. I hope you liked it. Bye! [kisses camera] [on screen] Over here, you see, the second half of the tablet I believe. Now, if I put this together with mine, I should be able to create a portal to the demon Kee-Oth's dimension and trap him in a circle of holy water. Okay, here we go. [puts tablet pieces together] Perfect. Okay, let's see. [reading tablet] Kee-Oth zaple myrups pama... [groan] [On screen] Okay, this is scene one and take one of Heat Signature 2. Ready? Action! Father, it has been a year since I was on the submarine, but, I still hear the screams! I was forced to choose; the lives of my men, or the entire planet! What would you do? Tell me father! I'm a mess, man! Wait, what do I say? Mmmm, Check please- No! Hold on, BMO, I feel like we should watch more of this video for clues, but you gotta promise me that I'm not going to see more weird Jake stuff. 더이상 제이크가 이상한 짓 하는 거 없을 거야. 진짜야! 그래도 내가 이 테잎 본 지 하도 오래 돼서 장담은 못 하겠네. 미안해. (I don't think there's any more weird Jake stuff.  Really!  But I can't promise anything, as I haven't seen this tape for years! Sorry for that.) Okay, high-five! Play it, BMO! Hmm, guess what, Lady? This dirty dog needs a bath! Wawoo! [Screaming] [Screaming] This stinks! What'a mean? Come on, Joshua! Back in the old days, you would have been up here trying to take me apart! Uh, what? That's my dad, Joshua, back in the old days. I'm his son, dude. Shoot. Where is he? He's dead, dude. Don't make me get emotional about it. Then why you being such a wimp then? Come on up here and beat on me like your dad would. Okay, that's weird. What's weird? You want to get beat up? That's weird. I'm not doin' your weird biz. You won't fight?! Nope. What the—! Hi. I'm I'm Jay T.—the Dog. I'm Only one can survive my pit! This bozo tried stealing my blood too! So youse better duke it out, and see who gets to live! But I haven't seen a man-dog in years! And now the universe has dropped one into my arms! Whoa, lady, no way. This boy's got. But fate has brought us together! The stars have paired you with a goddess. I like the way you talk, but you are crazy. Kill or be killed, you two! Yes, if I'm so crazy, then let's fight! [whispering] No, girl, we can bounce outta here. My friend Finn will save us any second now. I don't wait for rescue. I conquer till I am conquered. By love... or by the hand of an adversary. Well, I guess we're gonna have to fight then. Okay, take your time. I gotta do my daily sun salutation. [grunts] Release me, Joshua! [grunts] I'll show you! Dude, your blood is harsh! That's because I've been drinking so much holy water. It's in my blood, sucka! And naturally, I gotta go to the bathroom like crazy. Be right back! If I can't suck you, I'll suck myself's blood. Hehehe...Taste it, scrub! [Joshua runs back into the room and splashes his holy water on [ Would you like to rate this video? No time, Beemo. [Turns to Lady] Let's go find the cave from the video. Maybe we'll find more clues there. 잠깐! 내가 네 주위에 보호막 쳐야 돼! (Wait! I must cast a protective shield around you!) 됐다. 이제 가도 돼. (Done, now you're good to go.) Kee Oth Zaple Myrups Rama Mancakes? Whoa. Jake? [He sees Kee-Oth doing his sun salutation.] Yeesh. Eh? Jake? Finn, yes! Help me! Jake! 왜 저 못생긴 지지배가 널 껴안고 있는거야! (Jake! Why is that ugly chick hugging you!) This isn't hugging—it's fighting! Fighting! Jake, what do I do? Should I kill him? With what? With this! [He pulls out a pink Demon Blood Sword out of his pack.] Demon blood... That's right! Demon blood beats demon! No, that is not correct! Hahahaha! Oh yeah! Gimme that blood, stupid! Lady! Don't break the circle of protection! 당연하지! (Of course I won't!) [Kee-Oth continues to try to suck Yeah, hahaha! Your circle can't stop my sucking! Now I have your demon blood as well! Except it's not demon blood! It's a frozen grape juice that was blessed by the priest. [Flashback to Mmm, check please! [He licks the sword.] Mmm, grape-y! Wait... [His stomach starts rumbling.] Aaaaaah! My blood! Woo! Coward! Woop! Hey, hey! Lady! [He walks over to Lady and gives her a hug.] Let's go, bros! Samantha, you can come too, I guess. Very well. You've returned me to my world, so I recant my oath to destroy you. You made an oath. Okay. [She starts walking out the door.] Let's fight again some time. Nah, I'll just stretch into a tree. Hmm. Took you long enough to stretch outta that pit. [She runs off.] 뭐, 뭐가 어떻게 된 거야? 너 저 여자한테 반한 거야 뭐야! (What is happening? Did you fall in love with that lady or what!) Pshh, please! Not even. 그럼 그 함정에서 왜 그렇게 오래 버티고 있었어? (Then why did you spend that long time in the pit?) Uh, because... Kee-Oth was right there! An-and there were traps! I didn't have no blood this whole time, so I'm totally out of it. [He falls to the ground.] Jake! Woo...Sorry, I got a little light-headed. 아, 이 말썽꾸러기. 사랑해 자기야. (Ah, you little troublemaker, I love you, honey.) I love you too, Lady. Yo, guys, I still love Flame Princess. Okay, big hug! Hug! Jake. Jake! [Catches up to him] Hey man, shouldn't we conserve our energy? The Ice Cream Marathon starts tomorrow. [With mouth full] I know what the Ice Cream Marathon is. [Swallows ice cream] I've been training for weeks. And I am determined to eat more ice cream at the Ice Cream Marathon than anyone else! You sure like ice cream. Ice cream is good! What the croak was that? It came from over there [points to his left]. Whoa, Jake! Check it out! [Croaks strangely] It's a brave little Gnome Knight. What? That's a frog dressed up like a Gnome Knight. Actually, I'm a Gnome Knight who was magically transformed into a frog. And then I decided to continue being a knight. And now you're, like, attracting a mate? No! I'm on the verge of death! Oh. Well, you should just let go, man. Yeah, you've had a good run. No! I cannot die until I find a being whose spirit is brave and pure to take over my quest. [Avidly] Quest? Uh-oh. [Sing-song] Somebody's gonna do a quest for a frog. Tell me more about this... quest. I have to guard [opens chest] these magic beans. Huh? Two of the beans are good, but one is horribly evil! I have no idea which is which. So I've spent my life guarding them, preventing them from ever being planted. Beans?! Ah ha ha! Magic beans... hee! We'll be right back. Come on, Finn. I think I dropped my spoon in the bush. [Walks off] We will take your quest. You will? Sure! [Picks up chest] Consider it guarded. Also, take this [hands Finn his staff]. [Takes staff] Oh. Okay. Thanks. No, thank you. [Transforms back to a Gnome Knight] Whoa! Dude, what's goin' on? We took over the quest! What?! The beans? [Brandishes spoon at Gnome Knight] Now wait a second! Nope, too late. [Turns to ash and is blown away by a gust of wind] Ah, I miss him already. Well, we should get a move on if we wanna make the Ice Cream Marathon. [Walks off] What about the quest? [Reentering] Really? We have to do the bean quest? I gave him my word. Yeah, I wasn't here for that, so... can't we guard the beans and eat ice cream? No, man! We're on the job. And like you always say, "Work and fun don't mix..." "...unless you're a clown." I do say that a lot. Gee, sittin' in this hot sun, guarding beans. It sure beats 26 miles of vanilla ice cream. Or caramel ice cream. Or peach ice cream. Hey, what if we plant the beans ourselves? That's a terrible idea. No, wait, hear me out. See, [opens chest] if one of these beans is evil, then it's our duty to crush it, once and for all! Plus, two of the beans are good. If we plant them, we'll be bringin' twice as much good into the world! And we can make it to the Ice Cream Marathon! I hadn't even thought about that! [Yawns, grabs a pillow from off screen] I'm gonna take a cat nap. What? But we have to be ready for evil! [Yawning] If we take shifts, there's less chance of us falling asleep at the same time. [Starts snoring] [Thinking] Alright AAAH! [Stands up] Wake up, Jake! This is it! [Rubbing eyes] Huh? [Yawns, opens eyes] Oh! Aah! Bean pod! [Inspects it] I can't tell if it's evil yet. Huh? Baby Pigs dressed in silly costumes? Aw, look how cute they look all sleepy and snore-y. Careful, Jake. It could be a trap. We should test them to see if they're... evil. Okay. Each one of you take one test and one pencil. You have one hour to complete the test and prove we shouldn't kill you. [Picks up sword] And begin. Aw, they're so cute they can hardly hold their pencils. That doesn't fare well for their... [sword gleams] grade point average. Nothing evil could be this adorable. [Picks up a test] Hmm, you might be right. [Looks at test] The only thing on here is a cute drawing of an ice cream cone under "Do you have allergies?" Yeah, [shuffling through tests] nothing evil. Okay, the pigs are good. YES! [Runs over to pigs] You hear that, guys? You passed! A-plus! A-plus-plus! [Laughs] Oh, no! [Picks up sword] Jake, get ready. The second pod is about to drop. PROTECT THE PIGLETS! [Shielding pigs] Stay back, babies! Show me what you have to offer, pod! Magical wands? What? COOL! [Runs over to the wands and picks one up] Stop, Jake! [Waves wand around, sprinkling glitter] WOW! Is it evil? It's a wand that poops glitter! What's good-er than that?! [Runs over to pigs] Whee-hee-hee-hee-hee! [Sprinkles glitter on pigs] Hmm... [picks up a wand and waves it around as it makes a rainbow trail and sprinkles glitter] Hahahaha! Glitter on its own could be evil. But with rainbows? Over my dead body! Hey, let's have some fun with these pigs before the evil pod shows up! Yeah! Phew! I'm exhausted! They look so sleepy and peaceful. We have to stay alert. The evil pod could appear at any time. When it does, we must be ready to destroy it immediately. And then go to the Ice Cream Marathon, right? [Closing eyes] Yeah, man. [Yawns] Okay. I'll take the first shift. [Falling asleep] Rhombus. AH! Look! The third pod! It's bigger than the other two, dude! [Grabbing sword] Yeah, man. We've gotta kill it now. Huh? [Pod starts leaking brown substance] It's squirting! Squirting?! [Jumps down] See? Squirting. Right here. [Touches substance and licks his finger] Tastes good. [Starts licking the opening] Dang, man! Don't just lick stuff! It's evil! [Pulls back pod skin] No, it's not. It's... ice cream! [Starts eating] Is the evil sucking you in? [Jake continues eating] JAKE! [Pulls Jake out by his legs] [Sighs] That was awesome. Are you poisoned?! Are you dying? No, man! It was awesome! Look, Jake! It's filling back up! Aw, yeah! [Eats some ice cream. It replenishes.] This pod makes ice cream out of nothing! It's the "goodest" thing that's ever happened to me! Well, if this pod's not evil.... [Looks around] The piglets are gone! And so are the fairy wands. [Running toward screams] Let's go! The screaming sounds are getting stronger near Mushroom Town! Piglets! Stop this! Oof! Cram! Now I must find these wicked piglets' weakness and use it to "retribuse" them. Well, I found my weakness [starts eating ice cream from pod]. That's it! Ice cream! [Stops eating] What about ice cream? [Shuffling through tests] Yes... yes! HA! The exams confirm my memory of the piglets being allergic to ice cream. Just the thought of that scares me, man. I see one of them! Get ready to release! RELEASE! Ah, gross! That's--EW! [Grunting] Ah, gross man! JAKE! Jake! [Jake stands up] Jake, are you okay? [Starts dancing] Ahh, I can't stop dancing! Wha--? It must be the glitter! Oh, I really can't stop groovin'! It feels weird! Go on without me! [Takes a breath and starts charging toward the pig while squirting ice cream from the pod] YAAAAAAAAAH! "Freezed" to meet you! Hope you saved room for dessert! Killing you with ice cream! [Still dancing] Whoo! Yeah, man! Whoa! [Turns and sees one last pig, oinking sadly] Jake! There's one left... and I think he's trying to surrender. Kill it! But he's dressed as a little construction worker! It's freakin' adorable. [Still dancing] He's tryin' to trick you! Kill it! I just don't know if I can bring myself to do it, Jake. Why, thank you, Finn and Jake, for sort of saving our village. You're sort of welcome. Now if you'll excuse us, we need to start removing all of this ice cream from our homes and businesses. Not so fast! I'll take it from here, folks. [Starts eating] [To Mushroom People] He likes ice cream. Haha, nice job, tubby. But save room for the Ice Cream Marathon. [Angrily] I've always got room for ice cream, Finn. You know that, man! Ugh, I'm going to the Ice Cream Marathon. [To Mushroom People] He just really likes ice cream. Oh. Huh? Wha-? Where am I? Gunter? Gunter? I don't think this is Gunter. It's me, Ice King. Lumpy Space Princess? Yeah. And you're doing this because you like me? No, Ice King, listen. I'm gonna give you the straight dope. Okay. You're weird and old and you kidnap princesses. I know! But I asked you here tonight because I wanna know what you think of this. [Reads the cover title] "The Prince Who Wanted Everything; A Fionna and Cake Adventure"? Hey, why isn't my name on there? I want you to read it because you're their dad. Please be their dad right now and bring them to life! [Groans] Okay, might as well...at least until the cops show up. Ahem! Once upon a time, there was a most handsome prince, the future king of Lumpy Space, Lumpy Space Prince. Where do you want these gold-plated sandwiches your highness? [with No! [story is interrupted] That's not how I sound! Read it in a better voice! Okay, Okay! Yeesh! [Story continues] [In an english accent] By the window! For from the window shall I shower the poor with presents, as is my altruistic nature. Haha! Eat! Eat, my children! Son, come here at once! But, all was not perfect for this philanthropic prince of the people. His parents were slobbering monsters who didn't care that he was a beautiful prince! They wanted him to be a monster too. Why aren't you working on your monster exercises? I don't want to be a monster. Eat these worms! No! You will eat them! I won't eat them! Sharpen your teeth! No! Eat these worms! Eat those worms and sharpen those teeth! No, no, no! I told you hundreds of times that I don't want to be a monster, and there's nothing you can do about it! Where am I? [Gasps] Who's there? Reveal yourself! Hmm... Citizens of this realm, I am the one and only heir to the throne of the Lumpy Space Kingdom- I mean, I used to be. I rebelled against my parents, and now i'm a refugee. [pause] What's that? You wish to help me? I am touched! Fetch me some clothes and I'll pay you handsomely, by petting you. First, I need freaky clothes! Cool freaky, not monster freaky. Oh yes, and something to read as well, something mind-blowing. Oh wait! I also need servants! Recruit some locals, they work fine. Hmm... Not bad! Well done, my child! Next! Massenpsychologie und Ich-Analyse. That does sound mind-blowing! Yah! Aiyah! Aha! Cake, I'll save the captives, you take care of those animals! [runs off] Ya! Ha! Dance you puppets! You're free to go people! Woohoo! Hey! Those were my servants! Hmm? What an innocent face! [Fionna walks up to [aggressively] I don't care about your clothes! Hey! [Story is interrupted]You're not supposed to read it like that. Say it in a nicer way! I...Uh...I don't- [Positive tone] -care about you're clothes. You don't? [The shades on his helmet slides up] Finally, someone who's not impressed with my noble looks, but admire's what's inside of me! Is this really happening? You're clothes are so raggedy and soiled! And yet, you use them as a napkin! [ Dress me in the fashion of this peasant! I have much to learn from you, Fionna the Human. How'd he know your name? Hmm... Your movements are so free! My parents only want me to fly like a proper monster stiff and rigid, with a sharp toothed scowl permanently in place. But now, I see a new way to move. [Puts on his "Handsome Face"] Dance with me? Y'all seeing those big floaty faces? [eyes become wide, blushes, starts to drool] Pretty! Uh...No! Release! [tensed] Uh... What just happened? You were under my handsome spell for a moment. We can never marry, you know? I can only be with someone who is my equal in every way , a person so much like me that she doesn't even exist! I don't care, as long as we can hang out! Anyone want a sandwich? Ooh! I'll have one! So rusty... So humble... Delightful! Wait, where're your baby tables? What!? [Cake swallows] You don't dip your foods in gold before eating? Who eats gold? Great Glob! What is this? So charming! So quaint! So self-reliant! For years, I thought only of the needs of my people, but what about me? What do I need? This poorly made sandwich has enlightened me! What I want is to be like you, Fionna the peasant! And I'll need you as my pet, Cake the cat. Yeah, whatever. [Puts on his "Handsome Face"] Huh? Son! Flee, noble Fionna, for it is my stupid parents! And they're fatter than ever! Silence! Ahh! I'm just being honest! Huh? Come on, you beautiful dandy! Only your pure spirit can defeat your evil family! And this sword! You're right, Fionna! This is my destiny! I do have the power! Huh? Fionna! You must obey! My heart! Submit young one, become a true monster. No! It isn't right! Silence! Urh, Fionna, This is the end for me. But at least I made you proud, didn't I? I don't care. [Lumpy Space Prince gasps and sits up] My glob, Fionna! You've been telling be the answer all along! [Fionna and Cake sit up] The only way to defeat parental disapproval is not caring about anything! I don't care! I don't care! LSP! Haha! I don't care... Thank you son! You freed us from adult mediocrity and fatuousness. [Brings the microphone up to his face] I don't care! Fionna, Cake. Both of you buy me dinner. Yes, your hotness! And then, Lumpy Space Prince became so real that he can actually break through into this plane of existence. Woah! [Lumpy Space Princess reads along] And meet his one true love, Lumpy Space Princess. It was really happening. The secret portal began to shake and tremble. The countdown began. 10, 9, 8,[Ice king flips the page with his nose, Lumpy Space Princess sweats] 7, 6, 5... 4, 3, 2, 1! Careful! You'll wreck my gift for Princess Bubblegum. Whoops. Hey, what's it supposed to be, anyway? It's... a scale model of the Candy Kingdom, made out of my saliva! [Salivates] ...Sooo this means you wanna give 'er your spit, huh? Yup! [Realizing what he said] HEY, NO— It's okay, dude. I totally get it. Haw haw haw. I just wanted to give 'er somethin', uh... to celebrate her science... thing. You mean her... Super Science Barbecue?! You think it's science-y enough for 'er? Relax. She'll love it! [To himself] And then she'll love you. Heh heh heh... Wha?! Hey, there's Bubblegum! [Princess Bubblegum dumps charcoal on a grill.] Hide it behind your back, man! [Princess Bubblegum feeds Flambo a piece of charcoal.] Princess! Oh. Hi, guys! Just gettin' the grill cookin' for tonight's BBQ! Oh! What's that you got behind your back there, Finny? Oh, I... I made you somethin'. Really? Can I scope it? Yes. Close your eyes. [Doing so] A'ight. [Holding gift in front of her face] Get ready to open your eyes! Achoo! [She sneezes and pops all of the model's spit bubbles, destroying it.] Can I open my eyes? [Distressed noise] No, wait, uh, keep 'em closed for, like, three more hours!! [He salivates on the tray, attempting to make another model.] I'm gonna open my eyes. [She does so then gasps.] Oh, Finn! It's pink! I love pink! Oh, thanks, Finn! [Running up to the three] Princess! Princess! [Walking up] Better not say nothing, you! Yes, Chet? Um... So, I called grill-meister for the BBQ, but Pepper won't give up the spatula! Fine, fine. You can have it... [Running away] ...when you pry it from my cold, dead hands!! [Chasing after him] NOOOO!! Hey... If you two aren't watching the grill, then who's watching the.... [Noticing the grill is on fire] ...GRILL?!?! MEAT!! WAH!! [He knocks some steaks onto the fire then stabs a bunch of them so that they cling to his sword.] DIE, YOU FIRE!!! [He puts out the fire by piling the steaks on it.] [Walking up to him] Finn! That was awesome. Oh. Heh... Thanks, Princess. I'm always happy to help. I see. Your heroic brain is fascinating in a scientific way. Many scientific minds are going to be speaking at my barbeque. You should talk about something, too. You'll do that for me, right? [Mesmerized] Anything you want... Thanks, Finn! [She notices that Chet and Peppermint Butler are still fighting over the spatula.] Listen, I have to deal with this. [Walking away] See you tonight? [Blushing] Uh... Yeah! [He takes a reality check and starts breathing hard.] [Now a paper bag] Buddy, just breathe into me. Ah? [Turns back to normal] You're just gonna give a speech to a buncha' brainiacs. I can't hang with those guys. I'm full of stupid. Then we'll just borrow some brains by goin' to the place where knowledge liiives! Oh, Brain Town! Uh, no, the library. [Mysteriously] The Library of the Undead... No... Just the regular library. Hey, Finn, let's split. This turned out to be boring. But I have to cram this info! Okay, okay... I'll just keep readin' this book about figs. And I'll just read this book about pigs. Haha! Whatcha doin'?! I'm bored now, too! [Whispering] Shh! Hey! That's completely inappropriate! [She shoves them out.] But... w-w-we were just enthusiastic about learning! Hmm... So, if I can't book-learn for beans, we'll just get some smarty to explain scientific junk to me! Yeah, then you can at least sound smart... but where're you gonna find someone like that? Jake... we're goin' to college. [Whispering to Jake] Rad! Heh heh heh heh heh. Jake. You can just shrink yourself down. Oh, yeah. And when I finally meet the Werewolf Queen, she will take me on as her royal consort and we will rule in blood! Hey, teach. Can you talk more about scientific... uh... stuff and things? Well... sure, I could... [Irritated; raising voice] if this wasn't a class on THEORETICAL FIGHTONOMICS! [Awkwardly] Ohhh... Are you even in this class, Mister.... Uh... Wormy... uh, Wormy McSquirmy! [Skeptical] McSquirmy, huh? Well, we'll just see about that, I— [Pleasantly surprised] Oh! There you are. W. McSquirmy. I'm sorry. Yes, you're registered and you haven't shown up for a single class! Truancy hurts us all, McSquirmy! Hey! Ow! Please! Where's your compassion?! Let's kill 'im!! ASSAIL!! Excelsior! [He gets jabbed by Finn.] Jake, let's get outta here! [The professor worm strikes [Peeking out of apple] And stay out of Academia! [Goes back into apple] [Walking away with Jake following] Well... that's it. I'm all outta ideas on how to learn this junk. OH! Let's just solve this thing with magic! No... That's the easy way out. [Not seeing anything wrong] Yeah. It's the easy way out! [In realization] Oh! Oh, yeah! Let's go visit Choose Goose and his magical shack! Magic, you say?! [Chuckles] Yeah, Choose Goose! I need magic! Some kind of mind-enhancing magic. Ah, yes, the quest you are on, requires [Revealing them] the Glasses of Nerdicon! So... I just put those on, and then I'd be able to give that lecture... and Princess Bubblegum will totally dig it. Yeah! Whadaya want for it, CG? Lately, I've been feeling drained. I only wish to be entertained. [Thinking] Hmm... Oh! [He starts scatting and wiggling his finger. Choose Goose laughs.] Well done! The glasses, you have won! [Laughs] [Grabbing onto Jake] Everything small is just a small version of something big!! I understand everything!! Whoa, bud, are you okay? Oh, Jake... I'm better than okay. I know exactly how to impress the princess. More spit bubbles? No. No. Those spit bubbles were as fragile as my old perception of reality. But wait! Maybe you're on to something! I could show the princess bubbles the likes of which no one has ever seen!! And how will you do that? I'll start with a solid bulleted list! [To audience] Thanks again to Dr. Dextrose for sharing your fascinating research on the future of cuteness. Yes, yes, how charming. What... quaint notions. And now for a special guest lecture by one of Ooo's greatest heroes... Finn the Human! Ladies and gentlemen... and princess... [Winks at Princess Bubblegum, who waves back] I'm here to talk about multi-dimensional bubbles! But I'm not just going to talk about blowing bubbles! I'm going to blow... your... minds! Hmm? [Revealing bubble creator] This is a bubble-blower of my own design. With this, you can blow bubbles in different dimensions. [He sets the device to two dimensions and blows a bubble with no depth.] This two-dimensional bubble casts a one-dimensional shadow. [He sets the device to three dimensions and blows a normal, everyday bubble.] A three-dimensional bubble casts a two-dimensional shadow. [He sets the device to four dimensions and blows a three-dimensional shadow that appears to be a projection of a four-dimensional tesseract.] A fourth-dimensional bubble casts a three-dimensional shadow... IT IS BEYOND COMPREHENSION! [The audience is amazed.] Beyond space!! Beyond time!! Finn... that would mean you've created... Yes... A BLACK HOLE!!! FINN!! DO SOMETHING!! It's okay. I'm sure the solution is on my bulleted— [Losing it] LIST!! [The list gets sucked in.] Don't worry. I have everything under control. UNDER CONTROL?! MY GUESTS ARE TERRIFIED!! YOU'RE TRYING TO KILL US ALL?!? NO, OF COURSE NOT! I'M TRYING TO GIVE YOU THE GREATEST CONFERENCE EVER!!! Finn...! You've gone insane! What?! No way! I'm, like, the smartest guy in Ooo, thanks to these glasses! Glasses? Finn... take those off. You're not yourself! But— [Eyes watering] Please!! I need the real you! What's goin' on?! [Noticing black hole] WHOA!!! You blew it, Finn! With this! [The bubble creator] Then I'll kill it... with this! [His golden sword] Be careful! [She loses her grip on the bubble creator and it comes hurling towards Finn.] Finn!! Look out!! Wha? Fourth-dimensional! Jake! Let me go! Finn!! Don't do anything stupid!! I can't help it, man!! [Unravels himself] I'm all about stupid!! YAAAAAAH!!! [He leaps into the black hole, readying his sword for attack.] FINN!!!! Finn... My Science Barbecue was a fiasco... [Cries] What's this? [Reading list] "Make hyper bubble. Cause black hole. Become insane. PB takes off the glasses. Save the day. Win the heart of the princess."? Finn, you knew all this would happen?! Huh? Knew what? I wrote that list when I was insane with smartness! Whoo-hoo! [grumbles unhappily] Next. Oh, Your Highness, can you help my poor child? His hair is starting to go, and we can't afford flame care and... [sobs] Take this fortifier. It should last you through the cold season. [hands her the bottle] Oh, Glob bless thy soul! [runs off laughing] [sighs] More tea, Your Highness? [sips tea] Thank you. Mm-hmm. Who's next? Hi, um, my microwave seems to be broken, and— [A rumble is heard offscreen.] aah! [breaks down the front door] Flame Princess! Don John—the Flame Lord! I fear you're not evil enough to rule the kingdom. Excuse me? How dare you! [groans] [Her flames pale.] What? [laughs evilly while pointing to the teacup] You've been poisoning me. How could you, Ursula? Guards! Huh? [happily] Oh, here he comes! No! [laughs evilly] Yes! Playtime's over, honey. Time to give Daddy his throne back. [as an aside] I've secretly arranged to make Don John my vizier and give him my daughter's hand in marriage. Uh, yeah, I know. Ha-ha! [growls] Hwah! [shakes hands with Flame Lord] Man, you're looking shredded. My gym is dark magic, and my protein shake is rage. Okay, okay. [chuckles] Splendid work, Don John. No big D, bro. Heavens to Betsy! Cinnamon Bun! Don't let them escape! Come here, girl. We're getting hitched! No! [hits them back with his lance] Go away! I can't leave. I have to fight for my kingdom! No. Fight later. Now we get help. Huh? Aah! [jumps out of the way] Hwah! [jumps out of the way] Why did I jump? Thanks, CB. [guffaws] You're welcome. How are you feeling? A little better, I think. Who should we go to for help? Princess Bubblegum? Nah. I don't trust her. Yeah, she's devious. Well, I've seen Finn battle huge monsters and even armies, and we need somebody who can fight... CB, take me to Finn. Mmm, okay. Waah! Finn! Um... [chuckles] hey. Uh, Jake isn't here. He's sleeping over at Lady Rainicorn's maybe. Finn, I've been slowly poisoned by my treacherous handmaiden. Now my powers are weakened, and—and the Flame Lord has freed my father and threatened to marry me. But I escaped with CB. Oh, what?! I'll help you. I'll do anything for you. Listen, Finn, this doesn't mean we're getting back together. We're all business. Mm-hmm. Of course. Yeah, business. [sighs] I'm feeling exhausted. Where can I freshen up? [points] Girls' bathroom is over there. Also, it's the boys' bathroom. Oh, thanks. [walks off] So, what do you think, CB? You think I still have a shot with her, right? [bluntly] No. Does she ever talk about me? Is she seeing anybody? No and no. "No and no," she does talk about me, or "no and no," she isn't seeing anybody? Alright, guys, let's wolf. So... your Fire Wolf can fly. Yep. I taught him. Hmm. [places his hand on Flame Princess' shoulder] Whoa! You've cooled down a lot. No funny stuff. Things have been going great for me lately. Been hanging out with my boys. I got a cursed sword arm now, so that's new. Yeah, I've been exercising a lot and taking some piano lessons—trying to improve myself. Not dating anybody or anything, just getting a little me time, being the best [groans and looks back] Hyup! [moves Flame Princess in front of him] Oh, no! I hid my flameproof suit behind these rocks... just in case, whatever, you know? [drawing in the dirt with a stick] So, the guards are posted here and here, so we should probably sneak in here. [points] Suited! [walks over dirt drawing] Uh... Remember my fire suit? Hey, CB, you did a great job getting us here and everything, [extends grass sword] but I got this, all right? I got a sword arm, so— Yeah, you said that. Watch this. [runs through the front door, breaking it] Hey, guards! Come at me at the same time! [hushed] What are you doing?! Let's go, Princess! [grabs her hand] But that wasn't the plan! No! Ha-ha! [monotone] It's the princess. Capture them! [holding up his sword] Ahhhhhh— No, Finn, don't hurt them! They're entranced! [retracts sword] Oh, right. [Flame Guards move in on them.] Oh, no. Captured. [groans angrily then roars loudly] [breaks his lance in half and runs toward the guards] Hyah! Um... [grunts] [tries to break through the guards' ranks] There's CB! Get that bun! Could you move, please? Whoo, get him, boys! We're taking these two away. Don't worry, FP, your boy [to Cinnamon Bun] Put up your dukes. You have permission to leave when you out-duke us. Okay. Duke! Duke! Duke! Duke! Uh, duke! [hits the other one and takes one of their keys] These two are out-duked! Now I'm making my escape. [runs off] [sighs] Trust me. It'll be fine. For soon you shall be mine. [chuckles] If you've forgotten, I'm reminding you now. Never! Yeah! It's because you secretly still have feelings for me. No! [sadly] Hmm. [to Flame Lord] I can never marry you, because I don't even know you, much less like you, and forcing me to marry you is gross. Whoo! Whoo! Man, I love staring out over things. Whoo! [jumps] It's so good to be king. You said she'd do whatever you told her. Umm, okay... But she refuses to marry me. She's her own woman, you liar! Liar? You want to fight me? Aye—fistfight. [puts up his fists] Yes... I'll fistfight you. Come on! [punches Flame Lord in the face] You hit me? Felt good! [punches Flame King in the face] Oof! I love fistfighting. [gets punched again] You dirty bread breaker. [charges at Flame Lord growling and punches him in the face again] Aah! [punches Flame King] Put them down. [punches Flame King] Put your dukes down. No! [punches back] Whaa? We're saved! Hi. [procures key] Got a key. Fight! [punches Flame King] Fight! [punches Flame Lord] They're distracted. Let's go! [kicks Flame Lord off him] Leg press! [groans] Stamina... failing. Cheater! Onward, Jake 2! Aah! CB, are you okay? [groans] [closes his eyes] Huh? What happened? Should—should we keep attacking? Stop! You were all brainwashed... by him! [points to Flame King] Uh-oh. Hey, I don't like that guy! Yeah, let's get him! Capture him! It wasn't me. It was Don John! [A Flame Guard tackles him.] Aah! [groans weakly] [gasps] [dismounts and runs toward Flame Lord] Huh? [sits up] Oh... [rubs head] Aah! Have you all gone dumb from Don John's magic? I mean, how do you expect this softy to rule you? She's even weaker than before from being poisoned. Look! Oh, come on. You're wrong. Flame Princess may not be the most ruthless of all despots, but she is strong where it really counts—in her heart. And that is good. I have learned so much watching this beautiful woman work, and with her example, I have become a better man. I will be by her side as her champion and knight every step of the way because... I love her. Thank you. Aw, how sweet! [growls loudly] Jeez. Did I just get shown up by Cinnamon Bun? The Goblins have suffered long enough, Xergiok! Shush! You guys can't live without me, right? [kicks Goblins and slaps their heads] Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! You got problems, man. Blah! [He hurls a fireball at them and destroys the table; Finn and Jake evade the fireball] [Deflects a fireball with his sword] Wands are for wimps! [punches Xergiok outside] You may have beaten me this time, but—[Jake throws a rock at Haha! Yeah! [Uses spell to disappear] And stay out, Muffin Top! Finn and Jake! Finn and Jake! Finn and Jake! Nyaaar! Great job, warriors! You've freed us. I am Nice to meet you. [rubs Gummy's head] Nyaan! I'm sorry. I have not known a friendly touch in some time. You see, Xergiok loved to be a jerk to us... It's spanking time!!! Hiyahhh! Yeah! [Enjoying Sunset] Sigh. [Spanks Goblin] Yahhh! Ow! Ow! Ah, heck, Maria, I need to ask you something, [Pulls out ring] Do you want to do this marriage thing with me? Awwww! [Goblin in the background] Isn't that sweet? Oh, my love, the answer is yes. [Kicks ring, spanks the Goblin repeatedly] Boom! Hahaha! [To Maria] Congratulations. Oh!!! HA HA HA. We need a good king to rule us, like you mayhaps? Yeah, yeah! [Background "You should do it!"] Yeah, be their king. No, man, I'm an adventurer for life. If there isn't a king to not tell me to not start a riot, I could start a riot, then! No rules, baby! Start that riot! Whoo! Yeah! [Starts riot ] Flip this table! No one can tell me no! [Hammers own hand] Aah! Please, Finn, [puppy eyes] we need a king. Stop the riot! Huh? I'll become your king! To save y'all, from yourselves. [Stands up] We have a new king! Woohoo! Yeah! [Puts crown on Finn's head] Finn's gonna need a queen... I'll do it. [continuing cheering] Allow me to show you the grounds, Your Majesties. Show me what we got, Gummy. Show it to me! [stretches head across body] Dude! I'm psyched! Hahaha, yeah! The Goblin Birthing Pits, Your Majesties. I'm being... born. That's pretty neat. The Garden of Living Fountains. Whoo! Awesome. The Royal Game Archive, complete with controller hats. [Wearing controller hats] Ooooh. The Royal Dragon Stables. [thinks about riding a dragon and saying, Ohhhhh! Hahaha!] Whoa! And finally, the royal bedroom, with king-sized bed for the royal couple. Can you make that a bunk bed? Yes, my queen. Whisper Dan. [Claps] [Cranks a wheel, which in turn cuts the bed in half with a giant knife. Some hands spring out of the wall to hold the top half above the bottom half.] I call top. [jumps on top] And I call... Wait! For you, great king, the Book of Royal Rules. [holding a book with lots of pages] Hmmm. Sounds boring. Oh, no worries, my Liege. I'll read it to you. Hey, Jake, want to stay awake and hear some rules? [Immediately falls asleep. A lion and a goose sleep with him.] Alright, lay it on me, Gummy. Introduction, colon, the 623 royal rules were established in moon year 16, in response to Elder Gorflox's repeated requests for an organized... [Finn falls asleep and two black and white tigers cover him as blankets] Awaken, Your Highness! No way, dude. [rolls over and farts, waking the lion] Your Excellency! Let's go. We have much to do! Whoo!! [Leads Finn to another room] This is where you may perform your daily processes, my king [opens the door] Whoooaa!!!! Look at that huge mirror... and it's painted baby blue—boy style. Come, sire, it is time to brush your teeth in the front of the "boy style" mirror. [clapping] Whooo!!! Awesome! [takes the toothbrush] [gasp] Oh, no, no, no, Your Majesty! Let us brush your teeth [Does a back flip] Yaaaah!! Whoa, ease up, dudes. Aaaah, he's a rule breaker! Don't spank us too hard. [bend over so Finn can spank them] Spare them, Your Majesty! Spank me instead! [bends over] Set my buttocks ablaze! Guys, what are you talking about? Rule 1 The king shall not brush his own teeth... in the book of royal rules I read to you last night. Oh! Oh. Guys, put your hams away. Whaa?? I'm not gonna spank your hams. I'm not that kind of king! So then... we may brush your teeth, my lord? You can brush my teeth... I guess. Yaayyyy!!!!!! [Put 3 toothbrushes in his mouth and cuts to another scene] This brunch looks great! Can't wait to dig in. [about to cut it] Uhhh, I will cut that, Your Highness. Gummy, as king, I order you to let me cut it. I'm sorry, sire. The royal rules don't allow it. I'm cutting it, Gummy! [about to cut it] No! [takes them away and cuts it] [annoyed] Thank you, Gummy. Uhhhhh, a thousand pardons, my lord. You're not going to chew that, are you? Yeah. I'm sorry, sire. The royal rules don't allow it. Gummy, just let me do this. No one will know. I would know. [takes it off his fork, chews it up, and spits it out on Finn's plate] Uhhhhhh, Jake, this is nuts. Maybe, but rules are rules. [a goblin spits stuff out on Master, eat your food. I chewed thoroughly and heated it to goblin body temperature. I'm not hungry, Gummy. You look a little bit down. Would you like me to weep for you? No, Gummy. It's just.... [the door burst open a goblin came in] Sire, sire!!!! There's trouble in town square. A thief!! A thief? Hahaha, yes! I'll handle it! [takes out his sword] No, sire! The king is not allowed to fight. He must give a speech to the thief. That is the royal rule, my Liege. [Finn frowns and they go out on a balcony] There's the thief! [a guy trying to take a basket from an old lady goblin] Give me them hot buns, lady! Hey, thief! It's the new king. It's him! [everyone looks at him] I got a speech for you— Nooooooo! [covers Finns mouth] The Royal Speaker must give the speech. What. Ya see? [the royal speaker comes out on a balcony above them] [Clears throat] Since the dawn of time, the balance of what is right and what is wrong has... [looks back at old lady goblin and tries to get it again] Ha ha ha, I'll take this. Yes, you can feel it slowly working, eh? [starts to get mad and takes out his sword] I can't let this go on. [jumps off and gets the basket] Hands off, thief!! [gasps and backs away] Ha!! Here you go, old lady. [gives her the basket] Oh, no, the new king! Just as cruel as the last king. I—you—what? Oh, king, we beg you not to slay the old lady. [Finn turns around] Aaaah!!! [goblins murmur in fear] No, wait. Don't slay me! You may keep the hot buns, Your Majesty! [on the ground] I'm ready for my spanking, Mr. Xergiok part two. We're ready [bending over for their spanking] for our spankings, sire. [sighs] ♪I just want to help y'all as much as I can, and y'all just keep showing me your goblin hams. [rides on a goblin] When I became king, I didn't think y'all would show me your rears, but I'll accept my boring fate, and shed this tear... [wipes off tear] 'cause I can't seem to cure you of your groundless fears.♪ No. No more spankings... [Finn enters] Aaaahh!!!! Gummy, don't be afraid. I'm gonna stick to the rules now, okay? My lord, I'm sorry, y-you haven't heard? Xergiok is returning with an evil army. Come look through the scope! [Finn gets off the goblin he was riding] You see? [he sees an army of Earclopses led by Xergiok] Prepare to destroy them all! [passes out] Ohhh... [looks through the telescope and gasps] If I defeat Xergiok as king, I can prove to the goblins that an active king can be a good king, but I can't let them know until it's all over. Stay fainted, Gummy. [goes out door] Ooooooooh! Whisper Dan, have you seen Jake? [cranks a wheel, opening a hatch] I'm in here. Xergiok's back with an army of Earclopses. Let's bust them up. pbbbbbbbbbbbbb. All right, man, how do we do this? Hmmmmmmm. [looks at Whisper Dan] What if they figure it out? No way, man. I'm going to be honest with you, king Finn. When I'm scared, I feel most safe in your lap. Line up for you spankings, goblins! [the goblins get scared] Ohhhhh, too late—in my pants. Jake, the goblins can't see me being unkingly. I need a disguise. Jump in my mouth. [Finn does so and Who among you has the courage to face Shut your kissin' hole, Xergiok! It's time for a beatin'. I salute you, foolish warrior! You can be my personal sla—[Finn in Jakesuit claps in the Earclops' ear, and the Earclops lands on [into megaphone] wowowowowowowowowoowowoow! [the other Earclopses fall down from the loud sound] How in the world? [Jakesuit gets in front of [does vanishing spell and appears above them] Eat this! [Throws a fireball at them. Finn hits it away with his sword, which hits a rock. [cheering] [they pick up Finn and Jake and take them into the castle] Oh, great king, with the help of a brave soldier, you thwarted the evil Xergiok. [a goblin raises Whisper Dan's hand] Hurrah!!! [the goblin raises and lowers Whisper Dan's arm] C'mon, dude, lets get out of here. [sighs] Alright. [they walk home] Well, looks like they got the king they wanted, buddy. Yep. And we're going home to adventure. Mmhmm. High five us, dude. [ Wha? Why do the insides of you smell like vanilla? Ohh, uh, a wizard put a curse on me. Huh, neat. [Makes chanting sounds] Ogdoad, master of Level 8 shadow world, the winning vessel issues forth its pure essence. [Laughs] Aha aha aha... [Eats two drops of Cinnamon Bun's dripping sticky dough, then his eyes starts to glow.] You must overtake the vessel as night overtakes the day. By your very nature, you cannot deny my will. Hello, what jazz is this? [Gasps] Peppermint Butler! That's the last straw! I will fill you with the shadow of a thousand brown portals! Oh, no, Ogdoad! You are mine! Peanut Butler, bleh, Peppermint Butler, cease these dark magic activities [Grabs Peppermint Butler out on the tree]. Hey! Let me go first! I got stuff to do today! [Standing on the Gumball Guardian's hand] What'd ya do that for?! You neglect your duties to the princess. She has been in her lab for nine weeks. She needs to get out, socialize. Look, [Shows Peppermint Butler the suitors who has been waiting in line near Princess Bubblegum's lab.] her suitors, her faithful suitors, waiting for a chance to share her burdens. No, man! She won't date those old bags. You must try. [Puts Peppermint Butler inside where the suitors are] The Candy Kingdom worries for its leader, and it worries for you, dark one. [Sighs then walks down the line of suitors] Alright, you guys. All you guys are gross. How long have you been waiting to court the princess? 87 years. 120 years! I'm Gerald. Geez! How long have you been here, Krusty? [Points at Krusty] [Raises fist] Three hundred years, so what? It's not too late, right, boys? [chanting] It's not too late! Take me on a date! It's my right! Princess all night— Shush! [Points to Braco] What's your deal? I'm How old are you?] 21 years. I inherited my father's place in line after his ascension. [Raises hand] Hey. And you want to court the princess? Yes, [Puts his  hands on his chest] my heart instructs me so. Alright, buddy, I'm giving you a shot. But it won't be easy. I was born for this. Love will win on this day. [He and Braco go inside Princess Bubblegum's lab.] Sounds good, man. Prubs! [Wakes up] Hey, what? [Removes the pizza on her face] Who's that? This is Braco. [Sweating] Son of Loghan, who was begat by Hobus. [Writing notes] Okay, yeah? [Nervously]I want to take you... on a date. [Shocked] Thank you, Braco. That's very sweet, but no. Princess this lab reeks like brown mist; it's unhealthy. You've got to get outside and do some research on boys [Points Braco who is surprise]. [Shocked]That is way out of line, Peps, and you guys are donking up my research! [Begins knocking stuff off her table] Hello! Donk, donk! Princess, I love you! I-I love you so much it hurts. [PB stands and goes near him] The pain it—Huh? [Points some kind of laser pointer on Braco's eye] Hmmm, what you're feeling is called "infatuation." The pain is the product of you overvaluing a projected, imaginary relationship with me. No, Princess! What I feel is real! Meet me in the garden tonight [Runs toward the balcony] and unlock the mystery [jumps off balcony] of meee! Braco! [Lying on top of Mr. Cupcake] Come to me tonight. Okay Braco, but just for research, alright? Yes, Princess. Good job, man! You take it from here. Yo, who's that with PB? That's that Braco guy. Are they on a date? No, brah, the princess don't date. [Has Princess Bubblegum's device connected to his forehead] Oh, look, [Picks up a rose] a miracle of nature like you. Now hand it to me... [Braco does so] hmmm. [Looks at her device] Okay, I have what I need for now. Uh-huh. [Calls Morrow] Screech! [Glides down towards PB as she jumps on her back and flew her to the castle] Screech! [On his knees] Aww, [Sheds a tear] N-Nope, no. No tears for [He is walking down the stairs with him saying the things he is writing on his diary in the background] Dear personal diary, in a consequence of my latest romantic misfortune, [Grabs torch] I decided to consult the man who knew best about her majesty, [Opens his grandfather's coffin who is holding the book "Mind Games"] father's father. Amongst his dearest possessions, he kept a book containing every secret of seduction through superficiality. [Grabs the book] The art of "peacocking." [ [Doing some research then suddenly stops] Hi, Braco. Nice... hat. I know right. [Starts to move around while touching his hat] I am "peacocking" you to rally your attention. Mhmmmmm [Taking notes]. Ummm, so what's that on your head? [Looks at her head for a second] My crown? [Sweating] Oh, uhh— [Fires an X-ray gun at Braco]. [In pain] Oww. Hmmm [Runs off]. [Still in pain] Princess! Ahhh. Dear personal diary, I am in terrible pain. [Sheds a tear and throws the hat of his grandfather out the window] AAAAAAAHH! She is in her castle somewhere, a lonely heart. Do not fear, Princess; [Slaps himself] I won't let you down [Closes the windows]. Princess, Finn and Jake are here as requested. Hey, guys. Hey, PB, [Sits down] what's up? [Took out a remote from her lab coat] This is a soul stone. [Lights turn off] I need one for something I'm working on. Of course, it's really rare, but my scanners found one. It's in the Vapor Swamps. [The lights turn on] I printed the map with all the detail. PB, who's the new guy? What? [Turns around] Hey, man. [Gets the map] Oh, that's Braco, a suitor of mine. Oh, cool. That's cool—you're dating, that's coool. See ya, Princess. What'd ya think of that Braco guy? I mean, he seems kinda weird [Faces Jake] and passive and baby lambish [Jake panics and is trying to tell [On his knees] Jake and Finn, I seek your aid. I need to ask you for that map, therewith I can bring the soul stone to Bubblegum. Then she'll love me! That road you're on leads to nowhere. [Hands the map to Braco] Oh, oh, [Runs off into the distance] thank you! [Stopping cart] Huu-ah! This is how far I go. [Getting off the cart] Hurry, man, GET OFF! [Goes away] Ah! Oh! Uhhh. [Stands up then proceeds to walk past a giant insect monster] Hey, I see you! [Slices Braco's bag open] Oddsbodikins! [Jumps in the fire pit] AHHHHH! [Removes the cloth on his face] Uhhh. [Happily looks at the key] [Unlocks the seal of where the soul stone it hidden] The soul stone. This journey has come to an end. [Grabs the soul stone and produces a bright light] AHHHHHH! YOU BROKE MY HANDS! ["angrily'] STOP! The Beast! [Kneel down] [coughs] [Jumps towards Braco] RAAAAWR! Why have you stolen my treasure, boy?! [Stands up] For the one I love. Huh. Take the stone. Hmmm. [Covers PB's eyes] Guess who. [sighs] Braco. Ehhh, what happened to you? Oh, look, can it be? [Pretends to grab the soul stone from PB's hair] It's a soul stone! Oh, yeah, sorry, but I don't need that anymore. I just finished programming a proper simulation of a soul. In fact, this is much easier to manipulate than a real one. [turns to see that Braco is gone] Braco? Hmmm, [Puts the pen on his diary and closes it. And then he grabs a hammer as he breaks the soul stone, out of which a soul escapes, throws his diary and his teapot off the table, and breaks his ink jar] WHY WON'T SHE LOVE ME?! [A Gumball Guardian grabs him through the window] Ahhh! Set me free, you tranch! Give me the key to the shadow realm! Ahhhh! You said you were going to handle this. You are doing a bad job. [sighs] Alright, I got this. Peace. [The Gumball Guardian leaves] What's up, man? PB is not in to you? Yeah, man, I'm throwing the towel. Whoa, come on. PB's a tough nut, but don't trip out. Then you must help me... to crack the nut. [Lies down] No problem, man. [Sits on his body] We'll use magic, shadow demon magic! Say what? For your freedom, a spell. Yes. Make this man-noodle Braco into a walking love magnet! [Evil laugh] He he he he, this I can do, but can you pay the price, Braco? The price is your freedom, man. This price lies outside of our arrangement. To receive, you must pay! Hmmm, alright, well, maybe no dark magic. [Ogdoad laughing in the backround] I'll pay any price... for love! [Continues to laugh and blasts him with a dark magic spell] SWAZAA! Waaahhh! [Began to transform]. Release! Uhhh, who's that? Huh, what? [Makes groaning noises and his voice and appearance changes like he and a demon combined] Am I a walking love magnet? Well, you paid the price, no doubt, and I wanna have your babies. To the princess, then! [Leaves the tree] No, wait! What about meee?! And what's your number-one priority? [Hands the laser pointer to P-bot] To find someone to share my life with. Awesome, he he he. [Takes some notes] You ready to go on some dates? Uh, yeah, who should I date? There's a guy named Braco who's really nice. Ooh, where is he? I'm here! Braco? What happened to you?! I paid the price for love, was it worth it? Do you love me? Yes, I love you. Then marry me! We'll travel the world, have adventures, make the babes, get fat and weird, and float up to 50th Dead World, right? Oh, Braco, I don't want any of that mess. I do love you, but it's the undifferentiated love I feel for all candy citizens. I couldn't permit one of my citizens to suffer the way I saw you suffering over me. And so I made you this. Meet my doppelganger, P-Bot. Uhhh, this feels super-wrong. Oh, Braco, [Kisses him on the cheek] let's get out of this smelly lab. [Excited] Okay! [Carries P-bot and ran away to the balcony] Thank you, Princess! [Jumps over the balcony] Woohoo! Woohoo! You're welcome, my love [Drops a tear]. [Suddenly shows up when the Gumball Guardian puts him near PB] Where is he? Where's Braco?! I let him go, Peps. I knew he couldn't be happy without me so I built him a robo-wife. You should have given him to me! [Slaps her] [humming] [grunts] [opens it with his left arm] Oh! [rummages around] Parm, parm, parm. [takes out some cheese] Asiago's like parm. [Resumes humming and walks to the stove. He accidentally smashes his right arm through the table.] Whoopsies. [blows splinters off cheese] [chuckles] Okay, now easy does it. Ohh! Finn? [reaches downstairs] What's going on? [turns his head] Is the spaghetti all—whoa! [stretches towards Finn] Finn, what happened? I... messed up the spaghetti, [rubs his head] and then I got mad, and PB's candy arm exploded. [scoffs] Man, I knew that arm was bogus. Yeah, it wasn't the greatest. Sorry about the spaghetti, though. Man, don't worry about that. [walks Finn to the couch] You just went through some outrageous beeswax from losing your favorite arm and et cetera. You can't just expect to bounce right back to normal. I can't? Nah, man. Listen. [grabs two fake arms] All these princesses donating all these gross fake arms—they mean well, [throws both fake arms in the air] but they're throwing you off your game! You got to go at your own pace. If you listen [opens fold of skin around forehead] deep in your melon heart... [melon heart starts beating] that's where the real instructions are. [starts thinking] My melon wants to punch my dad in the face and steal his arm. [chuckles] Well, those things are bad, [grabs bag from table] so they can't be the real instructions, but you keep listening. Me—I'm going to go to the spaghetti store and buy a new mop head. I'll be back soon. Just remember—listen to your melon heart. [walks down ladder] [sighs] Melon heart... melon heart... man, I don't know. It'd be so easy if I could just go find him—my dad that is. That portal he went through after ripping off my favorite arm went right to outer space. And outer space is up there somewhere... I'm told. Maybe Banana Man could help me build a rocket or something... [starts building a small rock pile] or some stairs or... something, something, something... or, or, or. [notices the rock pile up he made and a telekinetic arm] [ [Bubblegum sees Jake] Jake, Jake! Oh, I'm so glad you're here. Afternoon Princess. What's that you're building? Wait, you don't know? I might. [Bubblegum pulls out a note and hands it to Jake] Here, look. It was taped to the tower. [ My biggest powerometer back at the castle was flipping all the way out. [She lifts up a device that projects a hologram of Finn's telekinetic arm ] It looks like Finn somehow manifested a telekinetic electro-emotional prosthesis. Word. Word. With this much raw power he could be a danger to himself or others. So I've quarantined the area till I can coax him down. Pfft. TMLO Princess. What does that mean? That means lay off. Finn's feeling this one out solo style. Give the kid a chance. [Singing] Daddy's got an arm and baby's gonna harm his arm by tearing it off his dad. [ Ahh! Oh, hi. [She is a cloud person who's home Finn has invaded. She holds a cloud gun at Finn.] Get out of my house or I'm going to face blaaaast you. Hi. Waah. [Opens the door to her house and kicks it] Yep, yeah. I know you. You're one of those swimmers right? A reeeal swim nut. What? No, I'm Well you can't swim in me. Not anymore, I'm not water. You can't get me up your nooooose. [Points to nose] [Starts building again] Okay, I'm going to keep going. I'm going to keep going, into here. [Closes door] [Jump cuts of [Shakes from cold and yells up to Finn] Goodnight buddy, I'm proud of you. [Still building tower, he sings tiredly] Baby's building a tower into space, to tear off his dad's arm. [Penguins wake up] From like where that round of the arm bone meets that weird flat bone on the top of the back. Gonna pull that until it comes off. Baby's building a tower of revenge... Hey kid. [Her house floats to Finn] It's me again.  Finn, look I'm sorry about blasting you yesterday. Hey man, are you really gonna do those things? [Still building] Uh, yeah, for revenge. I think it'll feel good. I get it, I get it. But let me tell you something. I used to be water. Like a pond or something real wet. I used to hate people swimming in me, [Sits down and pulls legs together to sit cross-legged] kicking and stuff. So what did I do? I evaporated, I got myself out of there. You should have pulled off their legs. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Listen, you have to stop obsessing about revenge. [Legs unfold] Umph. [Folds legs together again] Be like me and run away, you have to run away and never stop hating your old life. [Legs unfold] You gotta really dwell on it. Ah! What was that? I just thought about my anxieties and it's like my mind hand touched a hot memory stove. Hmm. Ah! Interesting. Oh hey, what are your thoughts on melon hearts? I don't know what you're talking about. Alright then, I guess I'll see you later. [Cloud home drifts off] Hey Jake, where's... [Ice block hits [Working on a machine]It's not healthy, it's bizarre and he could get hurt! Feelings hurt! Eeeeah. Eeeeeeeeeah. Eeah. [Standing below on her cloud house.] Finn! Hey what's it like up there? [Black circles appear and begin to grow and cover her up.] I figured I could turn into spaces, or something. [ Huh? Oh good, you're awake. [ Oh, my favorite arm. [Sighs and sits down.] Butts. Butts. Didn't help much did it. No. Wait, what? Bong Bong. [She turns on the lights revealing that she was wearing a suit pretending to be Martin. She takes off the mask and has a bruised eye.] Sorry buddy. PB? Wait, where am I? We're in the Candy Kingdom fallout shelter. [Shot outside reveals the light from before was PB's ship.] I brought you here after you passed out on the tower. You were hallucinating like crazy so it was really easy to trick you. I figured you'd thank me later after learning your lesson. Right, right. And look, the arm is gone too. See? [The telekinetic arm is gone leaving the just the flower.] So what do you think? Hmm. [Closes his eyes and thinks.] Yeah, okay. Thanks Princess. Oh, hey buddy you're back. How are you feeling? Um, neutral I guess. I don't want to punch my dad anymore. Ha, Ha! That's great! [Points at Finn's head.] You can always trust the old melon heart to get you through. [Looks at tower.] So I guess we won't be needing this thing anymore. You wanna do the honors? [Looks up at tower] Yes I do. Wha—? Wha—?! What? Finn?! I'm coming! [ [sighs] Yo, bro, you're sleepwalking again! Wake up! [He slaps Finn.] Whoa. Jake? Was I...? Yes, Finn. Again. Every time youse is screaming about "She's got me!" and all that. She's got... Wha? Wait, you don't remember? You just woke up, man! Recall it, baby! Come on. That's too much; don't punch yourself. Eh, it's gone. I don't know. [sighs] [He grabs Finn.] You're repressin' the memory, dude! I'm what? You're hiding whatever she is in a mental vault. Oh, yeah. The vault. That's where the stuff I can't handle goes. Kerplunk. Okay, so you even know you're doing it? [He lets go of Finn.] Yeah. [laughs.] Listen, we gotta find out who this lady is. We gotta open the vault a little. No, sir. This is just gonna keep happening, man. It's alright. I'm not hurting anybody. Finn, for reals. [ Alright. Chill, chill. Don't sweat it, man. It's not even a thing. Cool. Why don't you clean up the kitchen now? Okay. I'm sorry I did that. It's alright. It's only, like, the fifth room you've train-wrecked this month. Wow, that was fast. Yup. While you were doing that, I downloaded a new game on BMO. There's a cricket in here. [ What is it? I don't know. Lady said it's good. Hmmm. She likes those games where you're, like, collecting materials to make stationery. Naw, this is different. [ A'ight, let's peep it. Regression Simulator? Uh, okay. Start. Welcome, adventurer. Whoa. I am the Hypno-Priest. I will be your guide. Deep into your subconscious mind. Follow me now, adventurer. [gasps] The vault. Go in there, man! Don't be scurred. What do you see? I see... my past lives. I was a comet... A butterfly... A thing... I don't know what that is. Some kind of shape? Or a doodoo in another dimension? Do you remember anything about the scary lady? Scary lady? Yeah. I was her! Except she was a chubby tiger. No, no, no, wait, wait, wait. She was riding a tiger, and she wasn't scary. Hey, girl. Sniffin' around for that chedda? You know it. Got any work for me? I might could, but it's a top-shelf shakedown. Know what I'm saying? I can step to that. There's a rival camp down river. The leader's got some magic omelette, you know? [eats eye cucumbers] Mmm. You know? The kind you wear around your neck. I think it's pronounced "amulet." Oh, don't get fresh with me, girlie. I talk good. Anyway, when I get my hands on that omelet, whoo-hoo! Forget about everything, baby. I'll be the biggest cheese in creation. Sounds cool. I'll take the job Shake on it. You pull this off, and I'll let you join my gang. Uh... that's okay. I'll just work for coin. And, on the other hand, so to speak, if you screw up or chicken out, you're out of the game. Permanently. [He pretends to slit his throat with his finger.] Pretend my finger's a knife. Play dead. Deader. Ah! Another attack! My leader! Another attack! Bring them inside. Hey, you're up! I thought you might be hungry. So, who knocked you out? Bath Boy Gang. Ugh! I hate those boys! Yeah, they stole everything I had, but that's okay. My parents always told me that simple possessions aren't the most important things in life. Word 'em up. [Puts her hand on her heart] They told me "all you really need is a good computer." Amen. Wait, what?! They traded my arm to some tranch for a computer. They what?! What? Parents should protect their children! What? Really? Do you have any kids? All the Candy People are like my children, except young Mr. Cream Puff... he's like my boyfriend. Anyway, protecting my people is the most important thing to me. That's why I've got to take down the Bath Boy Gang. You think you can do that? I got a plan—a secret, awesome plan. In the meantime, I've gotta cover this radioactive river with candy. Wanna help? Thanks for pitching in, Shoko! You can stay here as long as you want. Psst! Psst! Shoko! What are you doing here?! I'm spyin' on you. Wait 'til I tell boss that you quit the life for a cruddy day job! I'm gaining her trust, you momo. Say... you can help me. Huh? Stay away from me you gang boy! Ahhhhh! [gasps] A Bath Boy! What're you doing?! Be cool! That was bananamas! Where'd you learn to fight like that? My parents took me to a dojo when I was little... they never came back. Wow. Your parents are the worst... hey, come with me. I wanna show you something. My secret project is in here. Whoa... what are they? The Gumball Guardians. Wanna help me finish them? Yeah! That's it! There's just one last step. Hello. [In unison] Hello, mother! Y'all go guard now, and don't let nobody mess with my stuff! [To Shoko] Hey, guess what, thanks for helping me make those guys. I like feeling handy. I want to repay you for your help. Oh, yeah? You gonna give me that amulet, maybe? [laughs] No. No, dude, I made you a thing. That's it. You can do it. You made me a man servant? [to Shoko] No! In the box. Oh, no... What do you mean "Oh, no"? I made you an arm! It's a dang plug 'n' play, girl. No, it's awesome... I can't believe it. That's right, I'm a technical wonder-child. Yeah, I know. [She tears up.] I'm sorry, I gotta go to my room for no reason. Okay! I thought we could do some two-arm stuff, but... uh, it's cool! Pretend my finger's a knife. [sighs] I'm sorry, Princess Bubblegum... Are you okay, princess? Ah, jeez, you're so loud! Are you in danger? No! Don't just guard me! You need to protect everyone! Okay. I knew it. Princess, you are getting jacked. Wha-hut? Whoa, hey! Halt! Ahhhhhhhh! Get her out of there, quick! Yes, mom. Uhhh... Alright. Take a break for the night. How you doin', buddy? The past was to be reckoned with. That's cool. Whachu' gonna do about it? [In German] Hallo, Bubblegum hier... [in English] atonement? Alright, Finn, I'm on my way. Ahhh... look at that. I got a new arm. That would be cool if I weren't about hit my reset button... Hey, hey. This way. What was th—aww, no. [covers himself with his blanket] Dog-drangit, Finn... Okay, here you go. Whoa, what?! My amulet?! Wait a second... [gasps] Is that...? It's me, Shoko! And PB, you're like a bazillion years old. You're not freaking nineteen! What the heck?! Weirdo. Heh. My vault feels lighter. [smacks lips] [sighs contentedly] That's the comet you're supposed to follow. Right. Right. I knew that. [picks up baby Hey, be careful, okay? Hold on tight. It's okay. I won't ever let you go. [in his thoughts] That's... true. Wow. Already? That was fast. Yep. We're here. It's time to wake up now. What? Now? Yep. Like, right now? Ye— [coughs] Ah. Where am I? [sees the crash site of a space ship] What the heck? Is that the comet? [sees a tiny collection of teepees by a miniature water tower] And a little farming village? How long have I been walking? Man, two whole days—at least! Wow. I need some water. [heads for village] No, wait—ah... jeez. [Walking through a plough field] Hmm... Fields are lookin' a little sparse. [looking at a dying corn corp] Kinda runty... I wonder if this village even has any wat—oh, snap! I see some! Excuse me, sir. Can I have some water? I've been sleepwalking for days. Haha, awesome. [ No, I'm a regular guy. I'm not just supposed to talk to strangers. [offscreen] Lionel, what'd I tell you about talking to strangers? You get your butt inside this instant! [in a metallic voice] HUMAN BOY! What the? THE TREE SPIRIT DOES NOT PERMIT FREELOADERS! EITHER HELP FETCH THE ESCAPE POD ENGINE OR KINDLY MOVE ALONG! Dad? Wait, wait! What are you doing? DON'T COME OVER HERE. Dad? [Does a spit-take with feathers] Finn! What the heck are you doing here? [Simultaneously] Dad! What the heck are you doing here? What? You were just yelling at me. No, no, no, that was the tree spirit—commander of all trees, bringer of hard times. Dad. You're not falling for it, huh? Well, it was worth a try. You know those little guys down there, they'll do anything for the tree spirit. I've got them fetching parts to fix my escape pod, instead of planting their fields. Isn't that sweet? Dad, your arm. Oh, this? Haha, yeah. When my ship crashed I got shot out of the window. I knocked a kite of the air, then caught my arm in a woodpecker hole. Whoa. But, it's cool, you know. Arms come and go. It's family that's important. [winks] Speaking of arms, though, I see you got yourself a brand spanking new one. How about that! Oh. Yeah. I got it from my PB dream sword. Uh-huh. Neat. Actually, for a while there, I thought if I ever saw you again, I was gonna tear your arm off. Well, shoot, who could blame you? Yeah. But you definitely don't feel that way anymore, right? No, no, it's okay now. [spreads his arms, revealing his intact right arm] Haha! Great! How about a hug? What the heck, Dad! Is everything you say a lie? No, no, of course not! Well, is there any way I can tell the difference? Ha ha, I hope not! Hot dang! Hold that thought! Those little guys are back with the engine bulb for my pod. 'Scuse me. [in tree spirit voice] I AM SENDING FORTH MY HOLY EMISSARY, MARTIN MERTENS, AND HIS REGULAR SON, FINN. DON'T FORGET TO DO WHATEVER MARTIN TELLS YOU. Almost there. Little further. Aha, little further. Keep it coming. There you go. A li-i-ittle further. A-a-and stop. [villagers throw down the part and collapse] Fantastic work, boys, absolutely fantastic. Holy stonk, Dad! You're messing 'em all up. [ What! No, no, no, look! They love it, see? [He kneels and tickles a villager] Goochy goochy goo. Goochy goochy! [The villager giggles and nuzzles into crooks of Oh. Right. Yeah, don't worry. I know I'm cramping your style down here. Am I right? Huh? Uh... yeah. Yeah, I-I guess... Sure I am! Now let's go fetch that piece. It's really warm down here. Well, yeah, son. That's just the ship cooking. One thing about this ship, it cooks! Should it be cooking? Nah, but that's just real life. [to the villagers] Okay, babies! I need this piece. [showing a drawing of it] It's a steering wheel. It's in the steering room. [the tunnel is full of crackling and burning wires. One of the villagers sighs.] Last one in breaks tree spirit's heart! Wait, wait, wai-wai-wait! You don't have to go in there if you don't want to! Nah, I think we want to. [smoothing his back hair] Okay, I know, I know. Listen, that's the last piece of pod, right? Well, I promise I'll make it up to little boogers tonight. [smiles and grabs Finn's head playfully] Haha, come here! [walking through them] Live it up, pals! This is your night. [towards some villages near the escape pod] Hey, hey, careful with the finish. That buggy is ready to blast! [They back off. [Shrugs] Mmm. Come on, tree spirit says! [uproots the barn, as corns spills out on the villages] Scoop it till you poop it. Let's get grrro-o-oss! Finn? Oh, sorry. So you guys wanna learn another one? [The villager nods] Ok, watch this.[ Eh, not really, I guess. We're kind of just looking to help out. Hmm. Hey! It's Finn with the grin! Mind if I sit down? [sits down with his legs around Finn] Haha! Look at this! You ever see someone sit like this? I guess not. Hey, Martin? Yeah. Uh, I think I really need some answers to stuff—like where did I come from or who's my mom? Haha! Whoops. [sighs] Okay, uh, long story short—you were born on a... boat... I guess. Like a... banana boat. In the middle of the ocean. So... all kinds of stuff tried to eat you—[ [babbles] Your mom was... okay? I don't know. Talking about it stresses me out. Maybe later. So one day, I got called on a dangerous mission— [A giant ship shines light on the stranded boat.] no, like a dangerous life choice, two roads diverging in the night and all that. And I couldn't bring you along. I always planned to come back for you, but I didn't. That's... true. The end! [beat] Look out! [clamps Finn between his legs] Everything is ruined. Everyone is fat. Aah! [gasps] [sees Martin by his escape pod] Martin! [runs to him] [to himself] Again? [to Finn] Oh, good morning, sweetie! Martin, are you leaving?! I absolutely gotta, kid. I got pressures on me, stuff you wouldn't understand. But what about the villagers?! That ship looks like it's gonna blow up! Uh... maybe. I don't know. Maybe it won't blow up. I've seen 100 things weirder than a ship not blowing up. Oh, Dad! I need to go shut it off! Okay, okay, wait! Wait. [entering pod] If you're gonna turn it off, you gotta pull the heat dump toggle in the engine core. It was too snug for me to get to, and those little guys aren't strong enough. Hmm. Hey, I could wait for you. Maybe we could go into space together. Why didn't you tell me about the heat dump in the first place?! I don't know... Wink! Daaaaah! [pulls a lever in the escape pod, launching it] What the— Heat dump! [tries to pull lever to no avail] Too... stuck! [leaving Finn's pack] Ohhhh, no. This is new to me. Mm... [hugs Finn] [growls] [pulls lever with all his strength] Man, you know what's weird? That wasn't even a comet that crashed back there. [carrying villagers over fallen tree bridge] So, then, what was that dream about? I don't get my brain. Okay, when we get back to the tree house, let me do the talking. Jake, these clouds are beautiful, dude. [Shrinks to normal size] Yeah, man. Makes me wish I didn't have to poop ever again and could just la... ah...ow! Hey, what the heck am I laying on? Hmm! Holy stuff! [Looks at Finn] Let's get outta here and wreck some stuff with this thing! Yeah! [Laughs briefly] Oh, snap, look! [grumbles] Oh... why won't you die? Hey, Ice King! Yes, Finn? Stop hurting that ant, you old bag! Or you're gonna get it! [grumbles and points the magnifying glass at them] You want some of this too? Huh? Eh. Ow, Jake! Sorry, this thing's kinda got a mind of— [panicking] Ah-haha! Turn it off, Jake! [coming out of the wand] Oh, my Glob, Melissa! I think it's kicking in! [gets shot out of the wand] We've got to stop it! What are we gonna do? [Appearing behind Finn and Jake] [blushing] Let's work together! [giggles] To defeat the wand! Okay, Ice King. We'll keep it distracted, and you sacrifice yourself to destroy the wand. [happily] Yeah, yeah! [runs off] Hey, wand! [Starts to dance with Jake] I heard you pay a robot to rub your tummy for you! Now, Ice King! Whoop! Whoop! Whoop! Whoo! [Belly flops on the wand] [laughing] Wow! That was awesome, dude! Wow, Ice King! Heh heh! That was amazing! Did I get it? [laughing] Yeah, man. You got it. [laughs] I'm scared it'll come back tonight. Me too. Can we hold hands? I need my hand to hold my spear. Why don't you use your other hand? Oh, that's a good idea. [He holds out his hand.] But... I need this hand to hold my spear. Use your other one. [Tries to reach the other guard's left hand with his own left hand.] Aw, it won't reach. Oh no. Wait! [He turns around to face the wall so that they can hold each other's left hands.] Oh- [Together] Oh! Hooray. [Facing the wall] This is less scary because now I won't see the monster coming. Wow. You know, I just noticed these things have rings on the end. It must be for blowing bubbles. [Twirls spear.] Huh? [Screams] It's back! Huh? Surprise! [He bites the monster's hand and latches on.] Finn, get in here! [He and the monster continue fighting.] Hmm. Okay. Yeah! [He draws his sword.] Sic em, Jake! Ha! [He jumps down from the bunk onto the monster's chest, where Jake has it pinned down.] Feeling good, buddy? I'm good. But this chump's about to get slain! [Struggling to keep the monster's arms restrained.] Slay him quick. He's got crazy devil strength! No prob. Here comes the slay... Don't kill me, Finn. Um... Here I go! [Unconvincing enthusiasm] Mathematical! Finn, are you doing the thing? I'm your friend. I'm you. Jake, maybe you should slay this guy? Aw, dude, you are doing the thing again! I'm you! Slay him! Thanks again for coming out to coach. The jamboree's always a big morale boost for the troops. Yeah. It's, uh, a nice distraction. Hmm. So how are you holding up after all the Fern stuff? It's been a rough month, PB. I know Fern was an angry guy who tried to kill me, but I still feel awful about the way he went. It's really messing with me. Oh, Finn, I'm so sorry. Death is no laughing mat- [She suddenly slips on an oversized banana peel and comedically falls to the ground. She examines the sticker on the banana peel.] Banana guard number 216?! Oh my glob, he's dead! [She sees more peels, covered in brown ooze.] This is a banana fudge massacre! [Together] Princess?! Princess?! Guys, what happened?! A terrible monster kidnapped squadron five! It looked like a banana, but it peeled other bananas! [Together] Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor, traitor! A banana and fudge monster?! That's candy tech. Okay, who's behind this? [She turns to Finn.] Finn! I need you and Jake to guard the barracks tonight. If this creep comes back and lays a finger on my guards, you show no mercy. Um... Yeah, I'll... do my best. Finn! Finn, stop showing mercy! Oh, no! I dinked it! Jake, I'm sorry! I- I couldn't do it! [Pained] Love you forever, man, but your guilt's hurting the team dynamics. I know. I'm gonna go make it right! [He exits in pursuit of the monster.] Cool. I'm gonna make peace with my aging body. No mercy this time, banana boy! I don't care why you're doing this or if you have a... a tragic past. [Fern's face appears again] I don't care! I'm hard like that. Don't kill me, Finn. [Growls] Nope! Oh, gross! What the heck is my problem?! Aw, fudge! Huh?! How'd I do that?! Um, it's getting away. Aah! Oh, Huntress Wizard! Hey, Finn. [She uses a magic arrow to create a vine in the direction of the monster.] Come on! After that booger! Thanks for the save, HW. Mm-hmm. You're chasing that grabby banana too, huh? I'm hunting it. It's an invasive species that's been destroying the local ecosystem with its nasty hot fudge. It's name is the Grumbo. It's a name that I made up just now... because you can't hunt what you can't name. Yeah, makes sense. Hmm. [Small talking] So how you been? Finn, I saw you falter back there. Why did you hesitate before you dealt the final blow? [Sighs] It keeps happening since I aced Fern. Every time I'm about to wail on some monster, I remember seeing Fern go kaboom... and the guilt paralyzes me. I can't seem to final blow anybody. I see. Okay, let's vanquish your mental block. Because I'll need your help to defeat the Grumbo. It's a two-huntress job. The second huntress is me. Yes. The trail goes gold here. I mean, the fudge is still hot, but that squirrel dude just ate most of it. [Climbing off her back.] What? No! Ugh, I should have struck when I had the chance! Or not struck Fern when I didn't have the chance? Ugh! I don't even know anymore. This is just me talking, but it sounds like Fern was already headed down a dark road. Sounds like he was a bad version of yourself that you had to destroy in order to become an even tighter version of yourself. Does that sounds about right? Looks like we got some hot fudge on our hands. Okay, let's review our roles. When I take out its legs, you strike the underbelly. Got it? I can do this. I'm 90% sure I can do this. Gonna slice right through that sweet Fern face. Shh! Ready? [Unconvincingly] Yes. Duck - I guess. Huh? Bicycle kick! Now, Finn! Coop-degrassi! Okay, time to final blow it! Finn, don't you love me? [To Huntress] Uh, can we maybe switch roles? [Struggling to keep the Grumbo bound] Not again. Oops! Oops. Oops. Oops! [High pitch voice] HW, let's come back and try tomorrow! [To herself] Okay... Huntress Wizard, get out of the way! Think, think, think! [Growls] Okay, if I can't fix my mind, I gotta fool it. [He points his sword at Huntress Wizard and thinks to himself.] Attack. Attack. Attack. Finn, help me. I'll save you, buddy. I did it. Sorry I almost got you killed. It's cool. It's totally cool. I knew you just needed a push. That's why I very smartly pretended to throw myself in harm's way. [She take's Finn's hand and helps him up.] No, actually, that's not what did it. Yeah, right. We both know you're totally in love with me. Finn? Are you here to rescue us? Oh, glob! There's someone else here too! I don't have my peel! Don't look, don't look anyone! [The banana guards continue indistinctly, embarrassed.] It's okay, guys. Huntress Wizard is into natchy living. Weird. These Grumbo remains are 100% artificial candy flesh - like straight out of a lab. I wonder who made him. Who indeed? Who is the brilliant puppet master working tirelessly behind the scenes, completely unfazed by this minor, minor setback? [He crosses out a picture of the Grumbo.] Why, it's me - Uncle G. Ready yourself, Princezzin! Your boy hero will be no match for my next creation. Dude... how long are we gonna follow this frog? I just wanna see 'im put on that crown. [Running towards the gate] Wooow! It looks cool in there! [Pointing to lock on gate] Too bad we don't have the key to this. What're you talkin' about? [Indicating his legs] I got two keys right here! Whoo-hoo! Wow! Look at this place! Jake. Are these donuts? They look like donuts. But maybe they're poisonous donuts! [Jake begins sniffing one of the donuts on the bush.] Yeah! Sniff it, Jake! Suck up those toxins! Wait a second... I don't know what poison smells like. Hey! [She strains towards Finn and Jake on her cane.] [Lifting her cane] Razzamafoo! Hey! What gives?! You ate one of my donuts! No, I didn't. I just sniffed it. RAAAAAGH!! You're lying! The stink of magic dog lips is everywhere! Holy slug, lady! Calm down! Listen, Mrs. Witch. I never married! Well, I never ate your donuts. You... you're eating one right now! [Mouth full] No, I'm not! [Noticing he is holding a donut] Whoa-hoa! Hm... That's weird... I don't even remember grabbing this. My subconscious must be hungry, huh? Huh... whatever. [Finishes donut] [Convulses angrily] MAGICUS NOMORICUS! Uh-oh. [Gets blasted] AAH! [The magic smoke makes him and Jake cough.] Dude, are you okay? Yeah... I think so. Just a little chilly. [Noticing he is in his underwear] WHOA! Ahahahahahehehe! What did she do to you? I stripped him of his magical powers! For stealing one of your billions of donuts?! Yeah, it's not like I killed your husband or somethin'. [Livid] I AM NOT MARRIED! The point is you overreacted. And what gives? [Pointing to his nipple] I used to have like eight more of these things. The only way I'll give back your powers is if you admit your error and say you're sorry and mean it! ...'Cause I can tell the difference. Well, you can forget it because you're the one who's wrong! [To Finn] ...Right? Total support, dude. [Convulsing angrily] RRRRAAAARRGH!! [Waving her cane] Go-backicus-from-whence-you-came-icus! Aw, now you're just makin' these up! [Rubbing one of the donuts] Are you alright, my... my donut pretties? Heh heh... Wait a second. YOU'RE A BAGEL! LIARS! LIARS EVERYWHERE! [The bagel becomes "stripped." Scene shifts to the Tree Fort.] There's gotta be a way to get your powers back! Where'd they come from, anyway? Were you born with them? Or... did you have a freak industrial accident?! Ha. That takes me back. Let me just... [deep voice] remember. [A memory bubble appears above his head.] I see a memory. When I was just a pupster... I'm rollin' around in a mud puddle, and I'm just... lovin's it. Oh, no! [The bubble explodes. What happened next?! Oh. Um... I went into the mud, and... I guess I became a magic dog? Okay! Then our course is clear! We'll roll you in every mud puddle in Ooo until we find the one that'll restore your powers. [Lying down] That's nuts, man. You got any idea of how many mud puddles are in the land of Ooo? Four? Maybe even five? Jake, come on! We've always been lucky, buddy! Maybe the first mud puddle we find will be the right one! Nonsense... but I like it! [Jumping out window] Then away! Hyuh! Whoo-hoo! Yeah, let's do it! Oh, my gosh! I forgot that I don't have magic powers anymore. How do we search for the mud without my powers? We run! Run like energetic little boys! [ [To himself] This whole time, I thought running was some sort of... leg magic. [ Come on, lazy bones! It's too hard! I guess you could ride on my backpack. [Straining] I can't reach. [Finn bends backwards; [Choking] You're... strangling me... a little, is all. Look there! Across the River of Junk! There's an ideal mud puddle. I'll stretch into a boat! [Strains then farts] I'm startin' to really miss that old magic of mine. We can swim this river easy! [Jumps into river] Come on, Jake! [Swims across, leaving Jake behind] [To himself] Man, that looks exhausting. You're right, Jake. It is exhausting. [Gasp] What are you?! I'm your subconscious! Okay, what are you doing here? I'm here to tell you that what you're feeling deep down inside is true! It is way too hard to swim across the river. It's easier to wear a hat. [Handing Jake a hat] Here! Have a hat! [Donning the hat] Ha ha! Yeah-hea-hea-hea! Heh heh! Man, I'm glad I met you. Jake! Stop talking to yourself! Cross over already! Uh, I can't swim that river, dude. My subconscious says it's too hard. Check out this hat, though. [Growls] What's wrong with that guy? [To Jake] Then just wait for me there! Whatcha workin' on, Finn? [Finn continues constructing a catapult from the junk, still mumbling angrily to himself. "... have to do everything!"] Look at you! Doin' stuff! [Finn pulls down the catapult lever.] Oh, is it a chair? [ Did it work?! Oh, yeah! I can feel this workin'! In fact, you should roll in the mud with me, Finn! We can both be magic! YEAAAAH! [Joins Jake in the mud. They laugh and roll around in it.] This isn't working at all. This isn't the right mud. I was just really hopin' this was over and done. [Sigh] Okay... Then let's just go find another mud puddle. Actually... I'm feeling kinda chubby-tired. Can't we do this tomorrow? Agh! This is stupid! Just go back to the witch and apologize and get your powers back! Never! I'd rather be powerless forever then apologize! I'm lazy but prideful. [Angrily] YOU'RE NOT EVEN TRYING, MAN! [Knocks Jake's hat off] First, you won't run, [Stuttering] a-and now you keep—and... a-and no matter what, I ju—you... Adventuring is too much hard work for a bro without his powers. But you are an adventurer. Nah, from now on, I'm just your regular old dog. ...Ironic given my current man-baby body. Behold the beautiful mermaid of the river. [Finn retches.] Which one of you mortals wants to mate with [Gesturing over her body] all this? Heh heh heh... Oh, um... How do I say, "You're the grossest thing ever," without offending you? RAAAAAARGH!! I'll scare her off, Finn! [Barks at her] How do we beat power like that?! Finn! I've got an idea! What is it, buddy?? Rub my belly! Yeah, I'm one of those kinda dogs. [Charging Gary] YAAAAH! Finn? [Gary takes him to her nest.] Finn! Come on, Finn! You gotta save yourself! I'm just a dog! Aw, man. Oh, geez... Okay. Then I'm back on the team! [Attempts to climb tree] I'll save you! Jake? [Giant eggs around him are beginning to hatch.] Don't worry! [He fails to climb the tree.] Hey, Finn... Can you help me to get up there? Hungry! Hungry! Hungry! [Desperate noise] If only I had my powers back! The only way I'll give back your powers is if— I know, I know! I have to apologize to that Witch. [To cupcake] Oh, you're doing so well... and I hate you so much!! [At gate] Hey! [He's straining to get past the gate, but he's too fat.] Witch! I need my powers back! So I'm sorry! I'm so sorry I ate your donut! Razzamafoo. [Straining sounds] ...Oh. [Stops straining] So do I get my powers back?! Mmm... Apology denied. What?! Why?! Because you took too long. Now you have to apologize while doing a variety of humiliating things. No way, Jose! Come on, dude. It's the only way to save Finn. Who is that?! He's my subconscious. Then he has to do it too. Aw... I, [Starts shooting with video camera] Wait, wait. Start over. You're recording this?! It's for my newsletter. No way. I have my dignity. Then guess what, cool guy? You can forget about getting your powers back... EVER!! [To his subconscious] Oh, no, dude! What do we do now? I'm dyin', Jake. Wha?! Hm. He says he's dying. Let that be a lesson to all you cupcakes. [Trembles] Hah... Why are you dying, bro? Because... I'm the subconscious of your old magical self. [Coughs] Goodbye, Jake... No! No! [Starts crying] So I've finally broken you. Yeah! [Sobs] If only... I were a humbler guy, my subconscious would be alive, and my best bud wouldn't be trapped in a mermaid's nest! YES! GLOAT, GLOAT, GLOAT! Alright, I think you've learned your lesson. [Kindly] I forgive you. [Magically stretching his arms] My powers! How can I ever thank— [Swipes her magic cane away] Ha! Got your cane! WHAAA! OOF! [Falls over] [Jake grabs yet another donut and eats it. His subconscious, now well, gets on his back and they both flee.] But didn't you learn your lesson?!? NOPE!!! [He and his subconscious laugh.] Hungry! Hungry! Remember to save the brain for dessert. Honey, I'm back! How about a big kiss? [ Jake! [Hugs Jake's face] I never should have doubted you! Well, I'm glad you learned your lesson that in a crunch, there's nothin' I wouldn't do for ya. Ahhh, so is that how you got your powers back? You apologized to the witch? Uh... [Sweats profusely] No way! I must have found the right... mud puddle! Yeah... I don't remember. Heh... eh-heh... [Blabbers lips with relief as the episode ends.] [Shouting] Finn? [Suddenly standing behind him.] Yo. Oh, hey. Me and BMO are heading over to the vuvuzela store in the Music Kingdom. You want to come with? I got to get a new vuvuzela. Somebody keeps smashing my old one. [He pulls out a snapped vuvuzela and blows into it pathetically. BMO screams in terror at this horrible sound] I can't bear this burden any longer! It was me! I'm the vuvuzela smasher! BMO, how could you? No, it was me! I'm the vuvuzela smasher. Neptr?! No, I'm the vuvuzela smasher. All right, all right. Well, I'm still getting one. You coming? Nah, me and Fi- ...Fern are supposed to clean out the chicken coop today. And if anyone tries to stop me, I'll slash their flipping faces off. True, true. Okay, well, I'll see you later then. Come on, BMO. [From downstairs] Jake, I'm sorry! I really am the smasher! [From downstairs] Ah, don't sweat it buddy. [Laughs] Holy cow! Fern, that was perfect! [He jumps down.] Hyup! You're getting new powers like every day now. Let me see you do Jake - no, wait, Ice King! Do Ice King! Ha, nah, man. [He shakes himself and his Finn disguise disappears.] Imitating uncool people infects you with their loserishness. Oh. Yeah, that rings true. [He holds up a red bucket.] It's too bad you didn't develop any coop-poop-scooping skills. That coop is incredibly disgusting. Actually, about that, I was thinking that, instead, maybe you and I could explore some secret ruins I found. Secret ruins?! Sweet! Maybe we can still catch up with Jake and BMO! Or maybe Neptr could come! Hey, Neptr, you want to go on an adventure, buddy?! [From another room]Oh my glob! Hold on! Actually, I was thinking maybe just you and me would go. Spend some quality time together, Finn and Yeah, okay. That actually even sounds like something Jake would want us to do. [Chuckles] Forget it, Neptr! [Singing] ♪ Dungeon surprise, right before my eyes, what a surprise, the dungeon surprise. ♪ [Together] One, two, three - shoot! Rock! One, two, three - shoot! Scissors! [Chuckles] This is so weird. I can't tell if it's boring or fun. Well, I can. It's boring. I want the thrill of victory! Who wants to be the same all the time? Come on, man! You know you love it! Come on! One, two, three... Come on! [Sighs] [Together] One, two, three - shoot! Rock. Paper. What?! Whoa! I won this time. What? But that's not fair! [Growls] Why is nothing ever fair? Hey, Fern, it's just a game. Don't be so weird. Don't-! ...Don't call me that. [Inhales sharply, sensing he has crossed a line.] Sorry. Ah, it's okay. That stuff won't mean a thing. I mean, that stuff don't mean a thing. Hey, come on, we're almost there! [Handsprings away] Whoop, whoop, whoop! Hey, wait up! [Handsprings after him] Whoop, whoop! [Continuous handspringing] Whoop, whoop whoop! [Both] Whoop, whoop, whoop! Whoop, whoop! [Stops in front of a cliff face.] Look, we're here! Where? I just see a bunch of rock, swear to glob. But check this out. [He pulls a key from his pocket.] Whoa! Magic key! I had to chop up a bunch of stubborn so-and-sos to get my hands on this baby. [He inserts the key into a rune engraved in the rock, and a magical entrance opens.] Dang. You've been busy. Wow, would you look at that! They hid this ziggurat in the cliff side. Amazing! Yeah, I poked around in there a bit, but- Dut, dut, dut! No spoilers! No, I know. I didn't go past the first level. I was saving it to do together. Sweet. [They reach the top of the ziggurat, where a pole leads down into an entrance.] Whoa, what is that, a fitness pole? [He begins swinging around the pole.] Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya! Come on. [They both slide down the pole.] This way. [ Hey, Fern, wait up. Hey, I just want to say that it's really cool that you're into this stuff. You know - that we have so much in common. It feels almost like we're real brothers, right? Or even closer. [Is silent for a moment.] I think that's the treasure chamber down there. Why don't you go check it out? I want to study these interesting carvings. [He pretends to be interested in the carvings.] Hmm. Fascinating. Oh. Uh, okay. I guess just holler if you need me. [He enters the chamber with a sigh.] Hey, what's this? [There are some items in the chamber.] Contemporary chair, contemporary trash, contemporary meatloaf? Hey, bad news, Fern. It looks like we've got a squatter situation here. I think they got the treasure, but they left some meatloaf behind. The good news is I know a meatloaf dealer- What the? Fern? [He knocks on the stone door.] Fern? [He tries to push the door without success.] Uh, Fern? I think maybe the wind blew the door shut. An "act of nature", I would presume. I'm sorry. I don't actually know how to make meatloaf. That's just a pan of dirt. Well, that's okay. I don't know how to either! ...Fern, please open the door. This is where you live now. You'll be fine. What?! Fern, what about Jake and BMO - my home? It's been your home long enough. It's Fern!? [He tries to fly kick the door but it doesn't budge.] I've been double-crossed by grass You'll be back in a month?! With a new bucket of trash?! It's hot! There's no air in here! I need air! I need air! Wha? [Examining his arm.] Oh! A microphone. There's some dried ketchup on it. [He sucks the ketchup.] Uh, hello. Hi, Finn! You're still asleep after your fight with Susan. But when you wake up, I'm sure you'll have fun discovering everything your new arm can do. And Finn, sincerely, thank you for defending our kingdom again. Oh. Someone else wants to thank you, too. [She walks out of frame and then holds up her hand, pretending it is a face. She puts on a voice.] Thank you, Finn! [Laughs, continues in normal voice] I don't know. Okay, um... Welcome, Finn! Huh. Yes! Huh? You donked up! [Tackles him.] Aah! [Shakes off the disguise.] How did you get out? [He throws Finn off himself.] Hey! What do you think you're doing?! I'm weed whacking. You've been Finn long enough! It's my turn. [He growls and leaps at Finn. Finn dodges.] Fern, smarten up! [With glowing eyes] Nuh-uh! [Taken aback] What are you? A weed whacker. My belzer! [Laughs] Fern, if things are going down the way I think they're going down, please tell Jake I love him. That doesn't matter. I love him! I know you do, Fern. Listen, we can stop this and just go home together. All this lying and fighting, it doesn't have to end like this. Today doesn't have to have this kind of... finality. [Mishearing him] Fatality! Hey, boys! Y'all have fun out there? [He turns around and sees Finn covered in scratches and grass stains, and suddenly shifts to a much more serious tone.] Wait, what happened? [Happily] I know that look. You just killed someone! [Blows vuvuzela.] Almost done, champ. There you go. [He picks up the bucket.] You looking for an uncle? Ha-ha! I win! Oh, hey, man. You and BMO play Finger Spread quietly. I need to get into the zone. [walks over to the window and looks up] I am ready to receive instruction from the realm of creation above me for the sandwich I am about to conceive. I am open; use me. [sharpening knives] One, two, three, four, five, six. [putting herbs on a steak] Rosemary, thyme. [puts the steak in a bag, seals it, and places it in a pot of hot water] Sous-vide. Keep that at 135 degrees. [cuts a loaf of bread in half and uses a blowtorch to toast the inside] All right, now we're gettin' somewhere. [places each ingredient on the bread as he says their names] Cream cheese! Pickles from my boy Prismo! And some dill! [grabs a bird from the windowsill] Diced boiled eggs! Bird from the window! Yeah, baby, now we're rollin'! Whoo! Common cucumber! Sliced Roma tomato. Sweet yellow onion—organic. [tears up] Oh, almost done. [wipes tears away and puts them in the sandwich] Tears for salt. Meat prepared sous-vide. ♪Bacon.♪ [holds up a lobster] You're the most important part. [He puts the lobster in a pot of boiling water, and its soul escapes. Is it glowing? You guys want some? It's cool, man. I know you want to eat the whole thing, and I'm cool with that. Thank you. [ Magic dog! I'll take some sandwich! You stay away from my woman! Eh, my sandwich! [scratching his chin] Hmm... yeah, I could do that... or... wait, wait! [he conjures a portal that allows him to grab Jake's sandwich] Sandwiche! Mijo! Magic Man! My sandwich! That's a good-looking sandwich. What are you gonna do with it? Something gross? [breathes on the sandwich] It's got my germs, so it's mine now. NOOOO! [stretches his arms toward Magic Man] Dead arms! [casts a spell] [groaning] Give it back, you animal! Look, if you really want your sandwich, you'll have to solve my little riddle. [punches the "Timeless" clock and moves the hands] When your face shows 720, when green leaves turn brown, the only way forward is down. Then you'll see, the wetter, the better. That's not even a riddle! It's wordplay, at best! You try and come up with something on the spot! It's hard! [makes a portal and slaps Jake through it] Ow! Now to savor the moment. [crashes through the wall] [in mid-fall] It's just you and me, baby. [moves sandwich toward his open mouth and snaps his fingers, creating a slow-mo sphere] What the? Jake, wait! [growls] What's he doin' in there? Why did he freeze himself with my sandwich? He's not frozen. He's super slow-mozin', motion. Look. Aww, that's gross! Well, let's go grab it before he hits the ground, which is when I assume he'll take a bite. Yeah, okay. Hmm. [pats sphere and puts his arm in it] Feels like cold spaghetti. [puts his head in] [slow-mo] Oh... hey, Jake. [slow-mo] Hey, Finn. [slow-mo] How long have we been in here? [slow-mo] I don't know. [slow-mo] Retreat! Whoa, how long were we in there? Five hours. Five hours?! [stretches around the sphere to see Magic Man] He's halfway to hittin' the ground... which is when he'll bite my sandwich, probably. Yes. [groans] [scoldingly] BMO! I agree that is when he will probably take a bite. You're not helping. Oh, you need help? I can help. [screen turns to a green spiral] Processing. Must be his new software. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [face returns to normal] Ding! I have the solution, Jake. What?! BMO, are you serious? Yes, this plan will work. Yes! But we have to hurry. Yes! Alright, BMO! Wait, wait, wait. BMO, are you just making a skateboard video? No, Finn. This is the plan. Are you sure? Jake, you will have your sandwich back before my board hits the ground. Okay, BMO. Yay, He lied to me. Relax. [takes a phone out of his pack] I'm calling Princess Bubblegum. It's ringing. [sighs] Maybe I should just make another one. [goes inside, turns on the radio again, and dances limply] [sighs deeply] Eh, okay. Let's do this. I can make another awesome sandwich. Creation realm, inspire me once again! [looks out the window at storm clouds, and the wind chimes fall] [uncertainly] Okay. Thanks again for coming, Prubbles. Of course, Finn. Once you explained about Jake's sandwich, I had to. [pulls device out of sphere] So, how's it looking? I'm picking up major levels here. Of magic? Molasses. Oh. He's using a molasses-based super-covalent subatomic bond, slowing down anything that enters its field, but only if the molasses is at room temperature. Hmm, this one. [takes a missile from a Banana Guard] My molasses warmer will get things moving. [slow-mo] ...iiiiiiiii... Well, I'm out of ideas. [activates a holo-phone] Who ya calling? Marceline. The vampire queen?! Oh... maybe... maybe it's just as good! [puts the sandwich together and takes a bite] Blech! [spits it out and throws the sandwich on the floor] It's terrible! [starting to cry] Dang you, Magic Man! You took my one and only! [takes a bag and heads outside] See, I think the molasses must be protected by some sort of chemical— Oh, hey, Jake. How you holding up? Not too well. BMO looks cool, though. [slow-mo] ...iiiiiiii... [sighs] Don't be sad. Yeah, Marceline's got a great plan. Yeah, man! What's your plan? [transforms into a winged beast] Demon juice! [jumps up] [growls] [lands in the sphere behind BMO] ...iiiiiiiii... Hey, man. What are you doing? I'm lighting these candles so I can move on with the grieving process. I made them with the leftover bacon fat from my sand—[sobs] I am not giving up. [takes out phone] Let's see. Who should I call? Ice King? Shelby? Tree Trunks? Tree Trunks?! No, man, don't call Tree Trunks! What's she gonna do, bake an apple pie?! Don't you get it?! It's over. It's over, and I've never been so sad. And you know what? I got to deal with it. [walks into sphere but does not slow down] Jake, look! Hmm? What? But how? Because you've never been this sad! That's what Magic Man meant by your face showing 720, or as some people call it, a sad face. What?! Nobody [begins to slow down] calls it that. Nope! No! Don't get judgmental. Stay sad. Right. [walks deeper into the sphere] [sobbing] Magic Man, I'm gonna sock you in the head! [punches his palm] [laughs] [starts slowing down again] Jake, every time you get happy, you slow down! Stay sad, man! Make yourself sad! Uh... okay! 제이이이이크!(Jaaake!) [sobs] [patting her] It's okay, Lady. You gotta let go. He's gone now. Let me take you out for a coffee... get your mind off things. 컵케이크 씨, 정말 고마워요. 당신은, 정말 좋은 친구예요. ( Mr. Cupcake, Thank you . You're really a good friend. Hey, Lady, I'm here for you. Don't you ever forget that. Hey, Mr. Cupcake, you stay away [starts slowing down] from Lady! No, man! Stay sad! Make yourself sad! Uh... I, I love you, Jake. We should have hung out more. What? Um, I love you too, Mr. Cupcake. I didn't want to hang because I thought Lady was into your muscles. And I thought if we'd hung out, you'd sweet-talk her and take her from me. What? I would never. I've got so much respect for you. Dude, I have so much respect for you! I try to be like you in some aspects of my life! Look, if something were to happen to me, and I wasn't here anymore, I'd want you to take care of Lady and the kids. That means so much to me. [cries] I wish we had more time together. [tearing up] Me, too! [crying] [now running through the sphere] Yeah, Jake! The wetter, the better! Keep crying! I'm sorry, Mr. Cupcake! [punches Magic Man and catches his sandwich] Boardslide! [sobbing] Ah-haaaaa! [holds up sandwich] Yay! I got you, baby. [takes a bite] [with mouth full] This sandwich is so good! Blah-la-luh. Hey, Jake, give me some of that apple. Coming up. [ [Muffled because of the apple in his mouth] Huh? Kissin' Princess Bubblegum on the mouth! [Spits and with nervousness in his voice] No, I'm not! And... I wouldn't even do that ever. Yeah, you would. You're just bad at talking to ladies. Hmmph. [Continues feeding birds] Ehggg-uh-ya-uh. Uh, should I keep going, Mrs. Yoder? [The mother bird's upper beak was bound up] No, Finn, that's plenty. Thank you. Okay. [Throws away apple] Let us know if you need anything else. Hyah! You two are heroes! [Landing] Hunh. Come on, dude. Hey! Do you hear that? She called us heroes! [Chuckles] Yeah, I heard. Huh? Hey! How's it going?! [Brushes the bush off her dress.] Ugh! Is that true, what the bird said? You guys are heroes? Why were you hiding in that shrub? Oh, I wasn't hiding. I'm a [Bored] Bleh. So listen, I need you two heroes to get me a lock of princess hair. [Scratches armpit then sniffs] Why do you need princess hair? Why? 'Cause I have a balding problem! What, are you, blind? [Pats bald head] [Louder] Are You blind!? No, we're not blind. [They nervously talk over each other.] I had no idea... I don't know... Anyway, I need the princess hair so I can put it on my head. [Sticks her head out] And then I'll be beautiful. Oh, well, uh, we know lots of princesses. [To the Tree Witch] Uh, can you, um, give us a minute? Yeah, okay. [Whispering to Finn] Dude, I don't think we should help her. [Whispering] Why not? 'Cause she's a witch! Maybe she's a good witch. Her? Are you kidding? Come on, look at her! [She turns her finger into a Venus fly trap and it swallows a butterfly.] If she was good, she wouldn't be so ugly. Are you guys still talking?! So what do we do? Tell her we can't help her 'cause she's ugly? No, man! She'll kill us or put a freaky curse on us or something. [Glances at her] Let me get rid of her with some of my world-famous smoove talking. [He walks over to the Tree Witch.] [Smooth talking with romantic music in the background] Hey. Sorry about that, girl. [Lies down] Ahh. You don't mind if I take a load off, do you? What were you guys talking about? How pretty you are. Huh? We were just saying someone as pretty as you doesn't even need a full head of hair. [Finn bends down next to him.] Isn't that right, buddy? Uh, yeah, totally! Nuh-unh! [Giggles] Girl, if I didn't already have a G.F., I'd be on you like butter on toast! [Seductively] I don't mind if you have a G.F. Oh. Umm… Dude, I don't think it's working. Yeah, I think I'm making things worse. Ah-ah-ahhh! Hey. What? How would you... court me? Um... spaghetti dinner? Hmm. Look, Lady, we can't help you get princess hair. Why not? Because... we only help when someone's in danger. [Jake smiles at Oh! Well, why didn't you say so? Hey... uh... what's—?! Yaaah! Hey! There. Now someone's in danger. I told you she was evil! Grrrrrr.... Yaah! What, you forget I'm a witch? Maybe. Well, maybe you should get me some princess hair, so maybe your friend doesn't get sucked into my bottomless bottom! Nyuh! Get some princess hair!! All right, fine! [Starts to leave] Wait! Uh, you... you can't tell anyone why you need it. What? Why? I don't want anyone to know I have a balding problem. O...kay. [Walks away] It's Princess Muscles's castle! [Runs to door and knocks] Hi, Finn. Uh, hey, Princess Muscles. What brings you by? Um, you were the nearest princess, and I need a lock of your hair. I understand. You do? Mm-hmm. [Starts to hug Finn] Aah! What are you doing? Trying to give you a hug. Why? I want hair, not hug! Oh, I see. You want to take things slo-o-o-w. No! I--I'm here to save you! From your hair! It looks really bad. Cut it off, quick! Of course it looks bad. If I had beautiful, shiny hair, no one would look at my muscles. [Starts punching Finn around] Come back when you wanna get serious about loving me! I am terrible at talking to ladies. Hmm... Where's a princess? Princess?... Princess... Princess... Who's that? [Lumpy Space Princess is sleeping at a hobo camp.] It's Lumpy Space Princess. [ [Sleep-talking] G-G-Get away from my camp! I'll cut you! Hrm. I'm never gonna go back home. Huh. Wait. Does she even have hair? [ Oh, my Glob! What the stuff are you doing?! Why are you cutting my lumps?! Because they're, uh... So-- [Gasps] I knew you liked me. No, I don't! I-I'm just stopping by because-- Just admit it, Lover Boy! You can't resist me! Well, if you want these lumps, you gotta put a ring on it! Where's my ring?! [Finn does a high-pitch scream and runs away.] I knew you liked me, Finn. That's why you're running! Get in touch with your feelings, babe! What am I gonna do? Huh? A graveyard? Yes! There's got to be a hairy princess in there that won't think I'm hitting on her![ Hi, Finn. Ohh! What? What are you -- Please stop. Where's her hair?! Thanks, Finn. [Leaves] "Here lies Princess Beautiful. She was so beautiful, but died of baldness?!" Dang it! [Mumbling to herself] I'm gonna look so beautiful... Invited to all the parties. [Arriving] Jake! Jake! I'm sorry, man. Getting princess hair is -- is impossible! They all just think I'm in love with them! Ugh! I can't do it. You're gonna have to spend the rest of your life in this witch's butt. Noooo! Eh! Quiet down! I'm daydreaming! [Whispering] Dude, if they think you like them, then use that. Embrace it! Find the least terrible princess you can, play her some music, cook her a meal, smoove talk her until she likes you. And then get the hair! Wait. You mean like go on a date? Marry a princess if you need to! Just get her hair! Aaaah! Jake! [Muffled] Go get the hair! Okay! Hold on! Princess Bubblegum! Hi, Finn! Uh... I need you to come with me! Why? I'm watering right now. Just come on. We don't have much time! What is this, Finn? We're gonna have a spaghetti dinner. Whoa! Really? Where do we sit? Um, Finn? Put your butt here! Hurry! Oh. [She does.] Hey, Simon, make it romantic. [He pays him a dollar; Simon starts playing his violin. Finn, I don't understand-- Please, Princess! Just stick it in your mouth! Well, okay. [Fills her mouth with a big spoonful of spaghetti] [Chomping] You're lucky I love spaghetti! Um, Princess... do you like me? [Gasps in surprise] Finn, of course I like you. Really? Yeah! Yes! Now give me some of your hair! Oh, Finn, that's sweet. Sure, I'll give you some of my hair. [Tears of a piece of her hair] Here. Take it, you cutie. Thank you, Princess Bubblegum!! [Quickly runs away] My spaghetti! My cat had kittens... and I'm thinking of naming one "Little Whiner." What do you think? Is that a good name? Totally did it! Genuine princess hair. You hear that, Jake? [Muffled] Just give it to her, already!! All right, lady, a deal is a deal. Ahh! This isn't hair! It's bubblegum! What?! It is bubblegum! Well, I guess you failed. Say goodbye to your dog. Aaaah! WAAIT! What? If I learned anything today, it's that I'm awesome at talking to ladies! And, lady, you are crazy ugly! [The Duuuude! Having beautiful hair isn't gonna get you anywhere, because you're ugly, inside and out, so ugly I want to throw up. Duuuude! No one will ever find you beautiful. everrr! And it's got nothing to do with the ol' chrome dome. It has to do with what's in here. [Points to his heart.] Can you get off my friend now? [Crying] Du-hu-huuude... He's right. Huh? Well, don't get me wrong. I know I'm ugly. And evil. [She stands up, letting Jake free.] But I thought if I had some beautiful hair, I could learn how to love myself. Gee... I feel kind of bad. I don't. Hey, witch! Does it have to be princess hair? No. Just beautiful hair. Well then, check this out! [ You'd really give me your hair? Sure! [Excited] So... how do I look? Totally beautiful. [He puts his hat back on.] inside and out! Thank you, Finn. And now to use my hair for evil. [terrified] What?! 'Cause I'm evil!! [Evilly laughs] What did you want from me? [She starts to run away but trips on her new hair. She moans in pain.] Ohh -- Oh, no. I think I fractured a branch. The other one. [switches passports for the gatekeeper] [grunts] [on phone] Finn? Finn? Sorry. Finn, I'm bored. Are you sure Princess Bubblegum doesn't like me anymore? Yeah. That's what she said. Sounds weird. Are you lying so you can do this dinner thing alone with Bubblegum? No way! I don't know if this is a good idea after your break-up with Flame Princess. PB is out of your age range, anyway. No way, man, I got no expectates. Whatever happens happens. [off-screen] Hey Finn! Let's go. Lates, bro. [to Princess Bubblegum] Comin'! Hey-ey, things got fancy around here. Thanks again for coming to Castle Lemongrab with me, Finn. I kinda hate these diplomatic dinners. Also, I think the Lemongrabs are getting weirder. Oh, uh, you know me—pretty good with weird stuff. It's just a shame that Jake didn't wanna come. I love Jake. Yeah. We all love Jake. [scoots closer to Princess Bubblegum] Announcing arrival o' Princest Bubblegah and little boy! Princess! [grunts] Holy— Oh, so pleased and gracious to welcome you to our sophisticated society! [bows] Bow. Yes, welcome— [screams] NO! Do it now! It's... dinner time! [rings a bell] Yo, Peebs. How's your lemon? Finn, this is mega-weird. Something's happened to the two Lemongrabs. They used to be exactly the same. [to Hey, princess! Look who happens to carry a flute with him. [pulls out his flute from his pack] No! Lemons only! Floor show! Do it better! [pulls out a remote and presses a red button] WHAT?! UNACCEPTABLE! Hmm. Acceptable. What?! UNACCEPTABLE! [mutters] Acceptable. UNACCEPTABLE! Ugh, I can't watch this any more. Excuse me, Finn. [gets up] Okay. Let me know if you get lonely! Man, this place is fallin' apart. Huh? [sings What's your name, little boy? My name is Badlemon Nohope, but you can call me That noise! That ugly lemon and his ugly noise! [kicks Lemonhope] Hey! By all accounts, this is a brilliant and sensitive little boy. Thank you, mistress. I'm taking Lemonhope back to the Candy Kingdom and enrolling him in a school for gifted children. No. He needs to stay here. [kicks Lemonhope again and tucks him under his arm] I hope you'll still be joining us for dessert.] [grunts] We need to free that darling boy. Maybe there's something in the Candy Kingdom-Lemon Earldom treaty. I don't think there is. What about a prank? Finn, what are you talking about? Mmm, I don't know. Maybe if we prank Lemongrab, like, just right, they'll let us take that guy home? Yeah. Prank. I don't see how that's going to help us at all. Pranks, like old times. Finn, no, that's really—hmm... okay, yeah! We'll pull a prank. Like old times. Okay. [cracks knuckles] Puddin' [makes two holes in the pudding and pours baking soda into one] Bakin' soder. [pours vinegar into the other] Vinegar. [closes holes] And the bait. [puts a sign on it that reads "Special for Big Lemongrab"] Now when Lemongrab stirs his pud [imitates explosion noises] splode-cano. [laughs] Pretty smart, dude. Hey! Ah, my pud! I'm going to enjoy this pud. I'm really looking forward to this pud. [dips spoon in pudding as a small amount of white foam comes out from the pudding] Oh, what is this? A-ha! Now give us back Lemonhope or prepare for mo' pranks! Dungeon! [sighs] Guess I must admit. One would have a hard time claiming that to have been a pretty good plan. Sorry, PB. No, no. Your plan was great, Finn. [opening Finn's pack] See? What's this? Huh? [takes out Finn's flute] Your flute. Wow, now Lemonhope can play it and the Lemongrabs will come open the door to smash the flute and we can all escape! Really great work, Finn. Oh. Here, Lemonhope. Now will you play something for us? Something beautiful? Yes, mistress. [plays screeching sounds on flute while Finn and Princess Bubblegum wince] Let me help you with—Lemonhope! [runs to other side of the room] I was sharp at the harp, now it's my turn to learn the flute to boot! [plays screeching sounds on flute while Finn grunts] Come, one and all, and join the dance! [screams] How dare you? How dare you release my prisoners? Soft Yike! [runs off] Oh, no! We're locked in. Finn, give me your phone, I'm calling Jake! What? No! Let's, um... we could do another prank! I brought some of your super-spicy hot sauce! Ah, so spice! Finn, this is serious! But, my other plan worked. Finn, your other plan failed, which was part of my plan, which worked. Your plan? But I thought we were having fun together. Finn, I have citizens who need me. I can't always treat everything like a little boy game. Oh. Yeah, no, that's cool. Mistress! Mistress, look! Something scary is happening now! [standing on a window balcony] How dare you? How dare you? After all I've done for you?! You try to steal my Lemonhope away?! You're too old, princess. Too old for pranks. Too old! [smashes part of balcony] I've tried imprisoning! I've tried reconditioning! You leave me no choice. Lemon Children! [pressing button on remote control and shocking the Lemon Children] Go forth! Go forth now! Sorry, sir. Get to safety, princess! I'll hold 'em off. What? Sorry, sir! [tackles Finn] Wait, so do you not like any games, or just little boy games? Finn... Lemon brothers! Stop! Stop and listen! [presses button sequence on remote that breaks the Lemon Children's shock collars off] It has cost me much, but I have learned that lemon need not squeeze lemon to survive. Lemonhope, go forth, grow strong, and return for us! You're going to love the Candy Kingdom, Lemonhope. You're learn all about playing, and play-math, and learning all day long, and you'll never get yelled at. Unless you drink my soda from out of the fridge. Yes, mistress. Yo, man, how's it going? Terrible? Well, yeah, mostly. But I think I learned something. Go on. Well, I'm thinkin' maybe age isn't just a number. Maybe older people, like, really are different. Y'know? Like, less fun inside. So whatcha saying here? I'm saying I think I really sponked up. I gotta patch things up with Flame Princess. Oh, dang! Didn't you hear? She's got a new boyfriend already! What?! [laughs] Man, I'm just kidding. [laughs with Finn] She might, though. Finn? Finn? Finn! Where are you? I need you to try this! I'll be there in a sec! [takes phone from backpack, calls Jake] What's the status? Good, man! Nice! Seal the deal, bro! [laughs nervously] Okay, man! Whatevs! You can do it, you hear me?! [quickly] I'm playin' BMO—call me later, bye! [hangs up] How's Finn's date? I think it's goin' good. Unlike your game, boiiiii! Where's the key to the tower, BMO?! Tell me! AAAGH! Okay, What's that? Are you trying to make yourself 18 again? Nah. This is an instant bath serum. It makes you sweat cleaning agents. I don't bathe. I want that! WAAAUGH! Hot, hot, oh—WAAAAUGH! Oh... so spice! So spice! [kneels down beside Finn and touches him playfully] YOU'RE so spice! Bwaaa bwaaa bwaaaaaa! [imitating trumpet] Announcing the arrival of the Earl of Lemongrab! Heh hah hah- AAAAUGH! Oof! Ha ha ha! This castle is... in... UNACCEPTABLE CONDITIIIIOOOON! UNACCEPTABLLLEEE! [points into the room] Thirty days in the dungeon! [still on floor] For who? Everyone in this ROOM! [raises his arms up over his head, and his eyes widen] MMMLLUUUUUGH!!! Wait, wait! You can't give orders like that! I'm in charge here, Lemongrab! [eyes widen again nervously, he points at Princess Bubblegum] TOO YOUNG! TOO YOUNG TO RULE THE KINGDOM! Watch your manners with the princess--! [cuts Finn off, holding his hand] HHHHUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOH?! What the huh? MMMM! [purses lips] HAH! [gasps, and begins rubbing his sore hand] I am next in line to thee throne! Sooo... I will be in charge... UNTIL PRINCESS BUBBLEGUM turns... 18 again! That's bunk! Right, Preebos? No... He is rightful ruler under kingdom law. It's complicated. [looks down in shame] I created Lemongrab. [gasps] He was the first of my experiments gone wrong... Nnnnnnuh! Gaaaaaah! EEEEEEAAAAAAGH! [looking mortified and frightened, she gasps] ... And now that I'm younger than him, he inherits the right to the throne. IF ANYONE NEEDS ME I'LL BE TAKING A NAP! A...a-a-and CLEAN this place up or dungeon! THREE HOURS DUNGEON! Who are you talking to?! THREE! HOURS! DUNGEON! [clenches fists and screams in outrage/defeat] NNNNOOOOOOOO!!! We'll see you in a few hours... okay, Starchie? [walking away dejectedly] Yeah, right... If Finn, this is dirt balls! We gotta do something to make him leave! Yeah... like pranking him up his face! Hey, yeah! And I have the perfect prank! C'mon, Finn! [sleepily] Huh? [reaches over to nightstand, puts on reading glasses, squints, and keeps his hand on the side of his glasses as he reads to himself] "You... really... smell... like... ... dog buns"...? NNNUUUUuuuuuooooooooooOOOOOOOOUUUUUUGGGGHHH!!! Well, well, well... IS THIS EVERYONE, THEN?! Yes, all the castle staff. Sooo which one of yooou WAS it?! Who did... the THING?! The... thing? [clenches fists angrily] FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU-- [eyes widen]—UUUMMMM!!! [unpockets the Dog Buns note, and unfolds it, showing it to the Candy People. He points at it, trembling frantically] THE THING, THE THING!!! Hey, man! Calm down! [gently tugging on the leg of Lemongrab's jumpsuit] It's just a prank, man! For laughs! Prank? F... for... laughs? [looking confused] Yes, of course... Just a harmless prank... f-for laughs... Ahhh... [bursts into a wide, jovial grin, then suddenly looks startled, and begins laughing, with the same startled expression, as his head bounces with every laugh as strange squishing noises play over the soundtrack] HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAH- OH! HAOAHOAHAOAHOAHAOAHAOHAO Heh, heh... [continued] HAHAHAOAHAHAOAAHA- [facial expression returns to his usual blank one, and he abruptly stops laughing. He turns to Peppermint Butler and says quickly] Twelve years dungeon. [turns to Candy People] All of you—dungeon! Seven years, no trials! [shakes head disapprovingly] C'mon... LET'S MOVE IT!!! [sighs] I don't think that worked out too math, Finn. What? No, no! He just needs some more prankin's to finish the job! He'll leave the kingdom. Let's try it my way this time, okay? Okay! OOF! [whimpers softly, as fat tears stream from his eyes] Cough, cough! [he continues to cry pitifully, obviously in much pain] Oooooh... [He suddenly looks up with a smile on his face at Princess Bubblegum and Finn as they run off, and laughs a broken, cracking laugh, triumphantly raising his fist into the air] Ha, ha-ha... GOOD ONE! [coughs a terrible-sounding cough into his fist, and cringes again, then looks up at the pranksters with another smile] Keep 'em coming! I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE!!! Ho... ha... Ah-ah-oooow! I got a new plan! Oh, yeah? What? We'll work together and use that serum you made. The one that was "Ah! So Spice!" And spice-bomb him non-stop 'till his butt falls out! How's that sound? [sighs, and smiles contentedly, leaning her head on Finn's shoulder] Hoooo! [exhaling nervously, his cheeks red with blush] Thank you for releasing me early from the dungeon, Master Lemongrab. I determine what is early, and what is late, Mr. Peppermint! [Closes his eyes and makes a slight bowing gesture to his butler] Yes, Your Earlness. Also... I don't know where food comes from! [points at Peppermint Butler] My Lord, food comes from Ma-- AHHHHtatatataNO!! That's why I am royal and you are servile! You ready to pour the stuff? Yeah! I made it super-hot this time! Wait 'till he opens the lid! Behold a plate of mashed carrots, flavor-- Shoot! HHHHAAAAAAA!!! HAAAAAAA! HAAAAAAA!!!! AAAAAAAGHAAA!!!!! Shh! [screaming] STOP SCREAMING!!! WHY ARE YOU SCREAMING?! Because I'm excited by this meal I made! Me, too. I'm excited, too. HHHHUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!! He's eating the dirt! SPICE IT NOW! He's heading for the orchard! Apple! Mmmm! Heh, heh... heh! [laughs nervously, as Lemongrab spots him and Princess Bubblegum] OOOOOONE MILLION YEEEEEEEARS, DUNGEON!!!! Maybe if we... set his butt on fire. No, Finn... There's only one way. I just didn't want to have to do it. If I change myself back to my real age, I can reclaim the throne. What? No! I mean... you can do that? [nods solemnly] Then... why did you wait so long? Because being 13 again is... Bloobaloobie! Hm? While being 18 is all plock dumps and wagglezags... I never really get to act like a kid. But, it's okay. Really. My people need me, and that comes first! Yeaaah... First thing we need is more candy flesh to increase my biomass. But I need my lab equipment to engineer it. Not necessarily, milady! Oh, thank you! Thank you, all! Okay... Next we need a bonding agent. Princess? I think I can help. Finished! There's one last thing we need. [starts to blush] Only the heat from a whopping love hug can catalyze the re-age-ifying process. [holds Princess Bubblegum's hands, then also blushes] Are you ready, Princess? Yes, Finn. But... first, I just want to say how much fun I've had hanging out with you. Me, too! And I... I wish I could stay... like this, with you, but-- I... I know, Princess. 'Scuse, me, Finn. [Gently nudges Finn aside, and approaches the dungeon door] Yo, Earl! [from far away] WHAAAAAT?! Hey! You're fired, ya BUTT! HHHHHRRRRRGGGRRRUUGGHHH!!!!! I'm so glad everything's back to normal. Thanks for all your help, Finn. Oh- you're welcome! But... uhm... What is it, Finn? Well, ah... Do you... do you wanna hug some more? What? Finn, you silly! That was, like, five years ago! You really gotta move on. Oh- yeah, yeah... Sorry... Such a silly boy. Hello? Hey, man! What's the status? Bad news, man... I... I got dumped. Awww. I'm sorry, Finn. But look, man. Lemme share with you a little secret on how to win the heart of a princess. It's not easy, but ya have to be persistent. You might have to defeat a demon lord, and warp through several worlds. But once you do, you walk up the wizard stairs, and produce your magic key you got in a water world and unlock the chamber door. Then, walk right up to the princess, and give her a smooch. Yesss! [triumphantly] Does that make sense? Yeah, man. I see what you're sayin'. Thanks, Jake. Mmm-hmm. [to himself] Go up the wizard steps.  Swords! Yeah, swords! Whoo! [scolds Finn and Jake] Oh, men and their swords... You boys, stop horsing around with my apples! Aw,Tree Trunks! Now, come on over! I baked y'all an apple pie. Yeah, apple pie! Whooo-hoo-hoo! I'm gonna eat it all before you even GET there! [runs away laughing] Noooooo! Apple pie! [blocking Finn] Don't let him eat it all! [chuckles] Now, you boys sit down and behave yourselves. Oh! Shoo, fly! Get off my apple pie! Huh! [dramatically] A fly landed on my pie. That's no good. [She throws it away.] Bye-bye. Why are you throwing the pie away? Flies wanted it, they can have it. Anyways, don't y'all worry 'cause the new pie is coming in the wag of a lamb's tail. New pie? Woohoo! Pie, yeah! Yeah! Wowowowowo Here you are. Wow. Come on, go ahead. What you think? Best apple pie ever! Oh, Jake, thank you, but that ain't the best apple pie. What are you talking about, Tree Trunks? What can be better than your apple pie? You ate all the pie... Finn, what would you do if you could do anything? Anything? Well, I'd catch a shooting star, travel to outer space and fight space monsters! I'd carve my face on the moon so the moon would look like my face! What would you do, Tree Trunks? I would go pick an apple. ...Lame. I'm sorry. I mean, it's just you pick apples every day. This apple ain't like the apples that I pick. They say it's the apple of apples; rarest kind of all. Legends call it the Crystal Gem Apple. That sounds awesome! Where is it? I've heard that it grows at the deepest end of the Evil Dark Forest. Whoo! Tree Trunks you gotta go pick that apple! YEAH! What? Me? Oh, no I'm just a cute little elephant. I'm not cut out for adventuring. Tree Trunks! This is your dream! Think about eating that apple with your own mouth. Or your trunk. Imagine the flavor. And your satisfied face. Really? You think I can handle the Scary Dark Forest? Yeah, and we'll help you. We love you, Tree Trunks. Okay. I'll do it. Call me... Adventurer Yeah, Tree Trunks! I love being so high up from the ground! Psst, I can take you even higher on my shoulders. No, Jake. She has a weak heart. Oh, yeah. Ewww, why is this ground all squishy? Whatever it is, I'm liking it. Oh, yeah! I wanna try! Okay. I'm cool with you letting you do whatever you want. Heeheehee! It's like some cookie dough! Oh, hello there. Uhh, Tree Trunks, stay away from that. Ugh, you're gonna get it, wall of flesh. An eye and a mouth. Well, I think I got the perfect thing for him or her... stickers! Careful, Tree Trunks, this thing is evil. Here's a rainbow sticker, and here's a scratch-and-sniff sticker. Smells just like a pickle. Oh, and this one is a holographic unicorn, but it doesn't have a horn. Oh, now, whatcha doing? Huh? Tree Trunks! Whoo! You better stay in that tree, baby. Um, Tree Trunks were you putting stickers on that evil monster? Yes, I thought it needed some tender love and affection. Oh, what a pretty butterfly! Tree Trunks? Ugh. Jake, I just realized that Tree Trunks is old and bonkers. We can't take her through this Evil Dark Forest. Nah, she'll be fine. But the monsters? It's fine. It's fine! Are you sure? 'Cause she has zero adventurer training. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's fine, she'll be fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine. [laughs] Maybe it is fine. Tree Trunks? Where'd she go? Tree Trunks! We gotta find her, Jake! Tree Trunks! Where are you, Tree Trunks? And here's your teacup, and here's my teacup. Tree Trunks! [Gasp] And here's your sandwich. Oops, you dropped it. Tree Trunks, run! Oh, hey, Finn. Hiya! Time to call your mamas, evil sign posts. Patience, boys. There's enough tea for everyone. Errr... NO! Oh, Finn. What a nice hug. I'm not hugging you! I'm trying to save your life! There's too many!! Finn?! Oh, Finn. That tea party was crummier than a big old biscuit. Errrr. Tree Trunks, I'm all jacked up because of you. Look at my jacked up face! Are you mad at me? No, I'm not mad. You're too super-cute for me to be mad at you, and you're a top notch adventurer. Now, let's go find and eat the heck out of that crystal gem apple together. Dang it! You go fight—I'll keep Tree Trunks out of trouble. Awesome. J-Jake I think Finn is getting jacked up again. Yeah, Finn can handle it. He's 12. I think I know a way to help him out. Uhh, you should stay here, Tree Trunks. But I thought Finn told me that I was a top notch adventurer. And my adventurer instincts tell me to seduce that tentacle critter with my womanly charms and elephant prowess. Uhh, no way. Uh, what are you doing here, Tree Trunks? I'm helping you by tempting this guy with my body. It's not a guy, Tree Trunks! It's a Snake Armed Ruby Brain Beast! Even brain beasts get lonely, Finn! Jake! You were supposed to watch her! She got passed me, man. I tried to stop her, but she overpowered me. GET her out of here! Huh? Finn, kill it! I can't find it's magic gem weak spot! Oh, there it is. I did it! I helped! I'm the sexiest adventurer in the world! Tree Trunks!! You're not an adventurer! You nearly got yourself killed again! Do you wanna die, Tree Trunks?! Is that what you think adventurers do?! Die and make all their friends feel terrible 'cause they couldn't save them?! Whoa, man. I'm going home now. Ugh... Tree Trunks. Tree Trunks! Don't follow me. Oh, Finn... You shouldn't yell at cuties that just wanna help you. OH! Man, I feel horrible. I was only yelling because I care about her safety. That's what happens when you care too much, dude. OH! Tree Trunks! Huh! Finn, I found the crystal gem apple. Woohoo! You're the man, Tree Trunks! Tree Trunks, I'm a huge butt guy for getting mad at you. I'm a huge fart. I was only upset because... I love you and I don't wanna see you get hurt. That's precious, Finn, and I'll accept your apology if you let me kiss your cheek. Uhhhh, I don't know, I-- Whoa! Let her kiss your cheek, man. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Whoa! Let her kiss your cheek, man. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Uhhhh, I don't know... A crystal guardian! Tree Trunks, stay out of the monster battle this time. I don't want you getting hurt. Alright, I promise I will. Radical! Back off you! Back off you! Stop copying me! Grrah! Stop copying me! Grrah! Ahhhh! A-a-oww.. Finn! Graw! Graw! Ow! Ow. He's copying everything we do. Hey! It's my butterfly-friend. That's precious. Whoo! Shake it, Tree Trunks! Whoo! Shake it, Tree Trunks! Gem-clam! Let's beat it up while it's copying Tree Trunks! Yaah! Crud, this is barf dude. Oh, man, I'm a total moron! We gotta fight this one Tree Trunks style. I'll get the make up. Hey! Crystal Guardian, are you okay with Tree Trunks taking a bite of that apple? I'm okay with it. I'm okay with it. And I'm stupid. And I'm stupid. Heh-heh, you heard the guardian, TT. Bite that thing. Okay! Whoo! How's it taste, Tree Trunks? Yeah! How is it? [bouncing] Whoop! Huh? [bouncing] Whoop! [floating] Whoopiiieee... Cheers, Lumpy Space Princess. Bouncing! Princess, this tea party sucks in a big way! But thanks for the invite! Oh, don't worry, Finn. The Mallow Tea Ceremony takes years to master. Princess! I think I just now mastered it! [Tea splashes in his face.] One more bounce. [Bounces down] Alright! [Hits the ground] Unh! Tea partying's hard, huh, Jake? [Hits the ground] Oof! Yes! What?! No way! It's super easy! Lumpy Space Princess, you big faker! You're floating, not bouncing! Fine. I'll prove it. [She stops floating] Huh? Ah! Oh, no! [Bounces down] Oh, snap! [She lands with her teeth on Jake's leg.] AAAAAGH! [Muffled] Oh. Sorry I bit your leg. You're still biting me!! Oh, my gosh. Oh, right. Sorry. Dude! Your leg! This is... new. It's nothin' ominous, though. Just a bump. Nah, that's no bump. It's the early stage of the lumps. Is it serious? It just means he's changing into a Lumpy Space guy, on account of my bite. It's just like, um, y'know... werewolf rules? [Imitating a werewolf] Ar, rawr rawr rawr rawr rawr rawr! Oh, no! What? You think I'm gonna turn all lumpy like her? Get outta here. [Arm suddenly lumps up] Wha? Finn, I think I'm freakin' out! Calm down, bud! I'll... I'll sock the lumpiness outta ya! Hey, now! [Bouncing down] Royal intervention! Surely there must be an antidote to the lumps. Yeah. There's an antidote, but you have to go all the way to Lumpy Space to get it. And Jake has to use it by sunset. What happens if he doesn't take the antidote by sunset? He'll be lumpy, like, forever. LSP, please! Can you tell us how to reach Lumpy Space? Yeah, I mean, there's a portal nearby. I can show you whenever. [Exiting with Lumpy Space Princess] Take us now! Take us now! [Intestines grumble] I should not have drunk that much tea! [Runs off] Don't go telling everyone about this portal or whatever. It's kind of a secret. Where is it? Portal's that Frog and mushroom. Password, please. [yells] Whatevers2009!! Good day, Princess. Is your father okay with you entering Lumpy Space with two... [puffs out his chest] non-Lumpers? [Whispering to Lumpy Space Princess] Just say yes! Yes, yes, yes! Yeah, whatever, fine. AAAAH!! Whoa... Lumpy Space. So, where's the antidote? Hold it. First, you should check out my house. It's, like, kind of lame, but way less lame than, like, your house. Uh, could you skip to the part where you tell us where the antidote is? It's up there at Makeout Point. That's so close! We can run there in no... [Camera pans up, revealing that Makeout Point is across an abyss.] ...time. Aww, what?!! It's, like, a million-mile fall into space! Yeah. You have to travel by car in my world, or else you'll fall into the Lumpy Abyss. Daughter!! Have you brought smooth people into our domain?! I had to, Dad... I'm trying to help them, so don't lumping yell at me! WHAT DID YOU SAY?! What did you just say?!? I SAID, "LUMP OFF," MOM!!! [yells gibberish angrily, then pants heavily] Uh... [To Finn] WHAT?!?! Vroom vroom?? Oh, yeah. [To parents] I need to borrow the car. You have made your mother cry for the last time, daughter! You are hereby banned from using the royal car!! [walks inside house and slams the door] Shucks! I lumping hate them! I'm really, really sorry, Finn. But I can't help you because my parents are horrible idiots. Don't you know anyone else with a car? My friend Melissa has a car. But she's dating my ex-boyfriend Brad. [frustrated] Call her NOW. Hmm. [pulls out cellphone] [LSP says to her phone] Call BFF 66. [answering] Hello? Hey, Melissa. What's up? What's she saying? [whispering to Finn] I'm asking her, jeez! Melissa, just listen! Have you forgotten what day it is? Melissa. I'm trying to help out some friends. Tonight is the weekly Promcoming Dance! Oh, Glob. I forgot. What'd she say? Tonight is the weekly Promcoming Dance! [To Melissa, in excitement] It's gonna be so flipping awesome! [exasperated] LSP, we don't have time for this. Ask for the ride, LSP. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh—[Finn takes the cellphone] [LSP continues to say oh a couple of times until she realizes her phone is missing] Wha?! [To Melissa, imitating Lumpy Space Princess] Melissa, [Lumpy Space Princess tries to retrieve her phone while LSP, you're so baaaaad... be there in a sec! Biyah. [hangs up] Hmm. [takes phone back] [Normal voice] Sorry. But Jake's lumpiness is worsening! Actually, I think I'm beating it back with sheer willpower! [Part of his head bulges up.] [flatly] Oh, my. [Forces lump back into body] Yeah, whatever. Just don't mess with my phone again. Hi! Ugh... OKAY! Let's go, let's go, let's go!! Aw, Finn, this music ducks, right? [suddenly in a lumpy accent] Ah. I love this song. We should totally TP Shandala's house! [in normal voice] Gracious! That was terrible! Finn, if you can't save me from the lumps... if I do turn... if I become lumpy like them, I want you to— [while embracing Jake] It's not gonna come to that. But if it does, I'll bury you beneath the nicest, most shadiest tree! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm saying that if I go totally lumpy, then I want you to get used to lumpy Oh, um... [awkwardly] Heh heh. [angrily towards Melissa] CAN'T THIS CAR GO ANY FASTER?! We're already here! Hi, Finn. We've been here for, like, five minutes. Finally! Huh? This doesn't look like Makeout Point. This is Brad's house. You wanted a ride to Makeout Point? You think I want to make out with you?! Uh... [blushing] Well, maybe I do, but... wait. [angrily] I HAVE A BOYFRIEND, FINN!! [throws Finn down] LSP, we gotta hurry! Jake's running out of time! Hey. This is hard for me, too. I mean, I used to eat chili cheese fries with Brad... so there's gonna be a lot of romantic tension on this ride! Hey. Oh, Braaaaad... [giggles] You miss me yet, LSP? [sullenly] Scooch over, Finn. I'm gonna sit in the back. This is it. Let's go! Wait. Watch yourself, Finn. The guys who use the antidote up here are notorious for being... [whispering] smooth posers. What does that mean? It just means what it means. Hurry. Get the antidote so we can get outta here. Thanks, LSP. BUUUUMPS. Um... bumps. Uh, yeah, bumps. Aw, man! Hey, guys. Lookin' smooth! Really? You think we're smooth? Well, mostly you in the center, but yeah! Why are you sucking up to us? My best friend needs an antidote for lumpiness. Chyah, lumpiness suuucks. Hey, Monty, time's up, sphere-hog! [ So the antidote is in that orb you were sitting on! This orb is the antidote, bruh. Can my friend borrow it? Yeah, sure, as long as you give it right back. [Tosses Finn the sphere and becomes lumpy] Hammacow. Thanks, fellas. What's taking so long? Did those smooth-heads give you the orb already, or what? Wait!! Is this another friend of yours? What do you care? Just give 'em the antidote already, and stop being such a poser. Sorry, kid. [exiting with Lenny and Glasses] We changed our minds. Why did you have to say all those rude things to them?! What? I was helping you. [sarcastically] Thanks a lot! [sincerely] They were right about to hand over the antidote! [bitterly] You're welcome a lot. You insulted them! And they got mad! And now Jake's gonna be lumpy forever! THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT! Wow. Now I know how you really feel. I was just trying to help, but whatever. [raising her voice] No. No, not whatever! I know I mess things up sometimes, but I'm really trying! And you're supposed to be my friend! [tearing up] Not like the fake ones I have here! So do what you want! I'm going to Promcoming! Are you coming or not, Lumpy Jake? No. Because no matter how messed up and lumpy I get, this guy never turns his back on me! [Completely transforms into a Lumpy Space person.] Oh, yah. Right behind ya. Just gotta turn my back on this guy. [Literally does so then exits] JAKE! IT'S ALMOST SUNSET!! [to himself] Jake... I didn't save him... I... [Yells wildly and angrily and then punches the ground repeatedly.] I'LL KILL YOU, LUMPY SPAAAAAACE!! Jam on, man! Huh? I thought you guys left! We were drawn back by your plaintive wail. We dig your directionless fury. Um, thanks. Respect. Here. [Tosses Finn the sphere.] Take it. Win your girl back! Yeah, there's no girl. But there is still time to save Jake! Do you guys know where Promcoming is? Promcoming takes place way down on that land-lump. Awesome. Do any of y'all have wheels? Nah. We were all ditched here just like you. Well... you think I can make it to that land-lump if I jumped off this cliff? You kidding?! A smoothie like you will plummet right into the eternal void! What if I was lumpy? Could I float over? No, no! It's too dangerous! I'd say there's a 50/50 chance of you making it! That's good enough for me. Now bite me!! [turning lumpy exceedingly quickly] Yes! I can feel the multiple bites accelerating the lumpification process! I'm starting to float! Don't jump, guy!! I have to! For my buddy. [Jumps.] RAAAAAAGH!!!! Wow. He's insane. Ah, I made it! And there he is! Yeah! Promcoming! Yeah! Cool! Jake! I'm mostly lumpy now! And I totally think you should sit on this sphere! No! Sit on it! [Slaps sphere down] No!! Please, Jake! You're my best friend! Just sit on the sphere! Chyah! I remember you! You're just a smoothie wannabe lumpy poser! Sit on it!! Before I turn completely lumpy!! NO!! Oh, no! I can feel the lumpiness... about to consume me!! [Fully transforms into a Lumpy Space person.] Oh, yah. Being lumpy's the best. Hey. Stop talkin' to yourself, dumb guy. Take your ball and get outta here. Fine. I don't want you to have it anyway. So I can't have it now, eh? That's right. It's mine. GIMME THAT BALL!! NO! You can't have it! I want it! Give it to me! You want it that bad? Go get it, then! Bumps, bi— [Sits on the sphere and turns back to normal.] [gasps] Oh, I'm not lumpy anymore! Oh, no. Finn buddy! You gotta sit on this! No! You can't make me! Smooth—OOF! [Runs into a muscular Lumpy Space person and gets knocked out.] Finn! Hey, Finn! Hey, buddy! Finn [waking up] Huh? Hey, dude. We made it. Man... There's something cold under my butt. [Noticing sphere] Oh! [laughs] The antidote! Just in time, too! LSP, I'm sorry I blew up at you before. I didn't mean it. I was just really stressed out. You know, it's fine. You and Jake can make it up to me by dancing this last dance with me. Sounds good to me. Whaddaya say, Jake? [Lumpy voice] That sounds totally lame. [Normal voice, laughs] I'm just kidding. Let's dance!  [Finn pulls out three mugs] Ohhhh! [Finn pulls out a plate of cookies] Ahhh! [He pulls out a Frisbee] Oh! Oh, man! My throwing and catching disc! Jake! Wanna play throw-n-catch throwing a catching disc?! Ha ha! Yeah man! [Chanting] Throw-n-catch! Throw-n-catch! [Running away] I call being dog and you be human! [Following Jake] Alright Dog! Dog Dog Dog Dog! You mean "bark." What? Oh yeah. [chuckles] Bark! Bark Bark Bark Bark! [Chuckles] [Over emphatically] Hello, I am a human. Hello, I am a human. Ready! Bark! [Waving Jake to back up] Back up a little! [Jake complies] [ [The disk flies up to the top of an extremely tall tree] [chuckles] More like the perfect blow! That blew. Aw, come on! That was the wind! The wind blows! [ Naw, I'll get it! Okay, but it's right here [In a Southwestern accent] Sometimes a man [Dramatic pause] just has to retrieve his own disc. [Starts towards the tree] [ Thanks! Oh, well hello there my friend. What are you doing? I'm trying to get to the top of this tree to get my disc. Oh, well maybe I can help! [He rolls into a spiky ball and rolls down the tree] Sit on me. Uhhhh, What? [Soft chuckle] Well sit on my needles and the shock will boost you high up into the air! [Chuckles] Sit on me, its okedo-its fine, go ahead. I don't think that kinda thing really works, actually. You can do it if you believe in yourself! Sit on me. [Looks up and waves him off] No. [He turns around and begins to walk away] Oooh, alriight, I'll shooow you! [He walks closer and then jumps into Finn's buns] [Does the girlish scream from "Burning Low"] Ouch! [He swats away the porcupine, but two quills remain in his butt] Sorry! I thought that would work. [chuckles remorsefully] [He rolls back up the tree to the same branch] [sighs quickly] I'm just no help at all. [Returns to hole in tree] Ooch! [Removes quills] Hmmm. [He begins climbing the tree like a peg wall with the quills] [When he reaches the branch, he shouts into the hole] See! Ya did help! [He continues climbing] [He continues climbing and pauses from exhaustion] Poooooped! [He climbs a short ways and lays on a large branch] [sighs] Pooooooped! Oh I apologize for staring, [Finn looks over and says "Hmmm?"] but I've never seen a chipmunk as big as you [laughs] I'm not a chipmunk! I'm a human boy! I'm trying to climb the tree, I'm trying to get my disc back. But for now I'm takin' a break, because I am pooooped! You should eat an apple to reinvigorate your climbing ability. [Points to an apple above his head] No thanks, I'm good, just gonna rest my meat hooks. [sighs] [The squirrel climbs up and retrieves the apple and jumps down in front of Finn with it] Huh? Huh? [He offers him the apple, but Finn silently refuses] [The squirrel persist and Finn tries to push him back] [Finn grunts and the apple is forced into his mouth] [The squirrel jumps off of him and the apple falls away] [He shrinks and spits out the apple] Aw, that apple was cursed or something. I'm sorry, I didn't know. Oh, dear I ruined your day and now you'll never get your disc. Naw, it's okay. I've been in worse situations. And even though I'm tiny, I do feel invigorated. Oh, good! What a relief! [His eyes shift away momentarily] Best of luck to you! [He climbs away] Bye! Bye! [He turns around and kicks the apple away] Choo Choo! [He picks up the quills and looks up] Ya can't stop the train! Tree! [He begins climbing again, but when he takes a short break, one of the quills breaks. He looks startled and continues climbing] [He takes a break on a similar large branch and looks up to see the full extent of the tree shrouded in clouds. He looks back down at the broken quills and tosses them aside] Woof. [He puts his face down] [ I ate a magic apple by mistake. Uhh! No wonder it's been takin' so long! Need any help? Nah, I got it. Okay, well, I'm gonna walk Lady home. I'll be back later. Don't eat any more magic apples. Silly. Yeah. No I won't. [Jake stretches away] I don't plan to. [ 천만에. ("Don't mention it.") You should take it easy. 괜찮아. ("It's fine.") No, no, let's get you back. [Looks up at the clouded tree as the fog clears showing how tall it is] Blegh! DISC! [He continues to climb. As he climbs, the background and mood of the shot changes to show that he is climbing over several portions of the tree] [Regular tree, Scarred tree, Windy tree, Worm-infested tree, and Butterfly covered tree] [Butterflies wipe across the screen and the very top of the tree is shown] [He pops up out of the foliage] Woooo! [Looks around] Where's my dingus? [Retreats back into the tree] [He is now on a branch with the squirrel a little ways into the background coiling some kite string attached to a kite] Hey! Hey, buddy! Hey, have you seen [The shot moves to the squirrel with [humming] [While the squirrel talks over him] Hey! I'm over here! Have you seen my disc? [singing] Wrap it up good so I don't trip and fall on my face like the last time. Heeey! [The squirrel goes inside] Musta could not heard me. [He begins jumping from small branch to small branch towards the hole] Doing, doing, doing. [Now at the hole] Hey squirrel! [He looks up to see a doorway illuminated and voice coming from within] [Finn is running up the stairs] I think we all agree, the human must be stopped! [In a Southwestern drawl] [He stops running at the top] Woah! [Various grunts and mumbles] Squirrel! What happened with the apple? [Finn creeps towards the doorway] Well, I made sure he ate that apple like you guys told me to do, but get this! [The scene now shows a small wood platform with a glowing green skull at the center. Two squirrels, two woodpeckers, an owl, a chipmunk, a beaver, and a porcupine all sit around it] It made him smaller! I think it mighta been cursed you guys! Well a-course it was cursed! We're tryin' to stop the human! [The squirrel looks confused] [sighs] [He puts a hand on his forehand] Look, just do me a kindness and go get me some more nut milk. [The squirrel backs out from the circle to get it] Come on fellas! I feel like I'm the only one comin' up with ideas here, Lenny! How do you think we should stop the human? Uuum… Maybe uh, trapdoor! Sometin' like that, with gravity! [Finn is leaning into the doorway] Hey, yeah! We could put like a rug over it! [ [Chanting and staring] In the tree, part of the tree. [Finn begins to run, but bumps into the squirrel with the nut milk] Sorry. In the tree, part of the tree. In the tree, part of the tree. In the tree, part of the tree. [While the others chant] Yaaaaaaaa! [Lifts up an acorn and knocks Finn out with it] [ What? Uuuh, I didn't say anything. [The squirrel looks away] [Pause] What are they gonna do to me? What? [Louder than before] What are they gonna do- I'm not allowed to talk to you. [Finn looks down] [Pause] Anyone and anything that winds up in the tree becomes part of the tree forever and ever. In the tree, part of the tree. So does that mean I'm a prisoner forever? Well yes. And no. Are you a prisoner? Yes. Will you ever be free? No. In the tree, part of the tree. It's very simple. Doesn't that mean that you can't leave the tree either? No I- Well yes and no. Am I allowed to leave the tree? No. Have I already left the tree? Am I miles away from the tree right now flying around like the flying squirrel that I am? Yes! In my mind! In- my- mind! [Turns and looks wistfully out the window at the clouds] [Looking concerned] Do you like it here? Yeah! [Shrugging] Well, yes and no. Do I like the nuts and acorns? Yes. Do I like it when they put me down and say mean things like "You're not a flying squirrel, you're just a regular squirrel! Nyaah!"? No. Do I wanna fly away from this place now? Yes. Would I make a break for it if I had a buddy to break out with? Yes. Hey buddy. What? [Steps through the somewhat wide bars] Let's get outta here. [The squirrel looks elated, now What are you doing regular, nonflying squirrel? Put that back! [The squirrel blows a raspberry at him] [gasps] How dare you! [Finn and the squirrel run away laughing] Well alright! Everybody after those…two! [Him and the squirrel run out of the tree onto the branch. Yeah! Perfect! Throw! [The disc flies straight, but then veers off like the first time] Sooo, It's a- It's a good thing you're a flying squirrel. Huh. Well yes and no. [Chanting is heard behind then and the squirrel rotates his head making a cracking sound] [He grabs the squirrel and drags him to the side of the branch in front of him, kicks him off, and jumps after him] [As he's falling] Peace ooooout! [They are falling extremely fast now] Okay! Activate your squirrel flaps! Flaps? No, I just have regular squirrel arms! [They fall a little farther through the clouds and see the ground] Aaaaaaah! Oh! No- [The disc flies under them and takes them with it] Hey! We're flying! [He and the squirrel are on top of the disc flying across the landscape.] Oohoho-Oh yeah! [laughs] Wooo! [They glide along looking at the landscape and wave to the not so hidden snail] Hey look! There's Jake! [He points down towards Lady's house] Jake! [He waves] [Finn muffles " Hey, this is nuts, right? [floats over to Vampire King] Look, I've got both my teeth. [points] Look! I lost one in a box turtle once. Also, I used to be dead. Mwah! [spits out tooth, which hits Fool in the eye] Fool, this is life. Get a hot dog if you can't take the bun. Pah! It tastes different here. Where are we? It's like we fell asleep on a raft and woke up in strange seas. Hmph! "Fell asleep"? We died. The demon Marceline staked us all. Why are we back? How did it happen? Listen—I dunno and I don't care. We're alive and I'm going to get eating. Ugh. [tries to put tooth back] Ahhh... Does anyone have any milk for this? [to cow] Do you, like, carry milk? Moo! Moo? This is well and good for you, Hierophant, all you ever needed was a forest and something hot to chew on. Where are the comforts of the old hive? The minions... the blood... the good blood with the gold leaf flaked into it. The gold leaf was stupid. It didn't taste like anything. We had standards! It doesn't matter when we are or where we are, because... we are. We must start rebuilding our realm. There's life here, and I bet it's pathetic. We march in, we take control, and we rebuild the hive! My king, are you listening? I dunno. Like... [yawns] What if we just got a loft downtown? Whoops, I'm hypnotized. [slaps himself] Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh! [laughs] Good old backwards egg! Ugh. Ugh! I don't like to dance. I'm a wallflower. Oh! Ugh. My king, surely you agree that this is our chance to go back to our old ways. Surely diverging from the old ways is what made us vulnerable the first time. Surely—[groans] "Surely"?! Surely? Shirley J. Temple! [releases Hierophant] Oh! [lands with a thud] I am your king, and I say it's a new era! Old-fashioned ideas have no place here. [growls] Do what you like! I know what's right. [runs off] If you're going to caterwaul like this, then I may as well start building my army. Hasta luego, turds. [walks off and disappears] Oh... gettin' dizzy... You sure the sun's not hurting you at all? No, this is great. I can even feel my skin aging. Huff! Cow Teeth and Shirley temple Aaaaaaah! I ran into some vampires! They were being weird as crabs! Do you know these oily doilies, Marceline? What?! No! I'm cured! It is weird though that it's happening at about the same time I got un-gunked. I gotta go see Bonnie. Ow! Oh yeah, guess I'm walkin'. No mo' powers. Didn't your daddy give you demon powers? My Dad never gave me squat! Well, just some soul-sucking skills. Remember this? Aah! My soul! [Marceline chuckles] Ugh, even though I got my soul sucked, I'll still give you a ride to Bonnie's because I'm good. Bonnie, I don't get it. Jake's talking about vamps at the same time you fixed me, and there can't be any still around! Well, clearly something's creeping around. Okay, what about the paste you took out of me? That should be all that is left that's vampiric in the modern world. It's all over there, safely in the safety bucket. What?! Pep But, what'd you do with the gunk?! Hold on, I'm working. Okay. There was one that looked like if a baby-snake was a baby-baby. Nah, that's not right. There was another one that looked like if an ant hill were a girl. Nah, that's not right. There's one of them that looked like a wet uncle. Nah, that's not right. There was a lady who looked like black drapes on a cake pop. Nah, that's not right. There was also one that looked like an angry stop sign coming out of a loaf of bread. Nah, that's not oh, actually that one's pretty close. What?! You can stop this now, Marceline, it's not too late. You've got power now. I see it. But you haven't paid a price. It's making you crazy. Marceline, there's no one left but me. Would you wipe out an entire species? For the last time, yes! That is literally my entire plan! So be it then. Uh Duh. I gave you a chance, Marcel Blah, blah, blah, blah! You know, Marceline, there's still another way. Give it a rest already! No another 'nother way To save my people. Wait! Noooo! This is really bad. These guys They're heavy hitters. If they get back to full strength, they'll tear this world apart. What's the plan, Marceline? How do we fight them? [Exaggeratedly clears throat] If I may Strong enough for an ultravampire But made for a vampire. Wow. Look, Jake, a two-pronged stake And a stake boomerang. Yes, and what's this behind your ear? A super garlic bomb! What the heck, Peps? Why do you have all this vampire junk lying around? I have these high-tech weapons painstakingly stockpiled in case a certain frenemy of yours decides to turn on us someday. Peps! No no, he's right. I could've snapped and done you all in at any time. Ugh! The cave is totally empty. No sign of anyone. Phew! Nothing going on out here either. Maybe we should all fan out Look for tracks. Or clues. All right. But everyone be careful. Even in their mushy state, these guys'll crack up ya sacrum. Gross. Don't worry about us, Marceline. Yeah, we're ready for anything. Can't smell nuthin' no more. Ugh! Ahh. Crud. Whoops. Oh no, my bomb! Hey guys, why don't y'all head back to the cabin? I'm gonna try to put together a profile, you know Forensically. Okay, Marceline, sounds good. Come on, boys, let's get you cleaned up. I know you're in there, you skunk. You butt. You stain. You Hey. Long time no see. Indeed. Hey! Marceline! Look at me! I'm all grown up now! I ate a chicken, Marceline. I see you're getting your strength back. Yes, not long now. Well don't get your hopes up. Pbht! Pbht! Things are different now. The humans are long gone. Someone's smelling a bit human herself these days. Anyway, you don't need to worry, I've changed, as well. I only eat animals now. Just like everyone else. Ugh. Huh? Does that mean we can be friends now, Marceline? It doesn't matter how you pretend to change. You've done enough already to get staked a thousand times over. You're monsters. You'll always be Smell my feet, Marceline. I promise you won't regret it. Oooh! Ohhhh Your loss. You know, the others won't be so easy, Marceline. Well how 'bout you? It doesn't have to be like this. Those are some pretty frou-frou last words. You've lost a step! I'm not even gonna need my powers. I'm surprised, Marceline. What now? Surprised you have the time to play around while the empress makes her way to the land of ice and snow. Simon. Crud! [humming a tune] Knock, knock. Yo, Peebs, you want to make a midnight Squeez-E-Mart run? I'm gonna drink the red from out the customers' bloodshot eyes. [chuckles] Psych. I'll probably just get a slushie. Bubblegum? Bonnibel! [touches sleeping figure] Wha—? [screams] [screams] [screams] [screaming morphs into singing] Ugh! What are you doing here?! [stands up] Be not afraid, child. It is I, the one true princess of Ooo! Where's Bubblegum?! [swipes claw, slashing pillow open] [chuckles] Whoa! Relax! [jumping on bed] Bubblegum is fine, just fine... and deposed! And powerless! So crushed by defeat was she that the tyrant exiled herself to a sad cabin on the shores of Lake Butterscotch—technically still Candy Kingdom territory. But in my mercy, I've allowed her to remain. You're the princess?! Since when? Well, by the reckoning of my new Torontian calendar, Ooo's official calendar, uh, two glorious months. Two months? But—then why didn't she t—[growls] Bubblegum! [flies out the window] Tell Bubblegum I wear her nightgown! Tell everyone! [growls] BONNIE! Marceline. What up? Ugh. Why didn't you tell me you got throne-jacked! I gotta hear it from that wax fraud! [shotgun cocks] Be cool, Marceline. Let's all be real cool. Give us a minute, Peppermint Butler. Hmm. [runs off] Hup hup hup hup... Well? I didn't get jacked. I quit. But yeah, alright, I should have told you. I was just [sigh] embarrassed. And it all happened so fast. I'm still trying to sort things out, see things rationally. Huh. Well, you could have talked to me about it. [scoffs] Yeah, 'cause you're so dang rational. Ha ha. I'm sorry, that's mean. I'm trying to be less mean. That's why I'm starting fresh with a new kingdom out here. Just me, Pep But, some pretty stars. Ugh, and of course, some varmints. Varmints? Varmints! [stands] Raiding my pumpkin patch. Every dang night! [kicks half-eaten pumpkin] After all my sweet bio-engineering? The nerve of these varmints. Not tonight! [sits] [whistles] So, how long you gonna sit out here for? Long as it takes. [shotgun cocks] Uh, alright, yeah! Let's get these varmints. Um...yeah. [makes fart noises with mouth] These must be pretty good pumpkins, huh? They're citizens of my garden kingdom. 100% loyal garden citizens. [chuckles] That reminds me -- so I was in the grocery kingdom last Sunday, 'cause free samples, you know. They had these, like, shrimp cocktail dealies. So good. I was sucking the sauce off them and hucking the shrimp at the ceiling. I kept going back for more and more samples, I could not stop myself. I don't know, man. The shrimp must have gone bad or something, 'cause all that red came right back up. Still invisible and yakking red all down the produce isle. It was awesome. [chuckles] Hey, you remember that one time -- [gasps] [shotgun cocks] Hey! Varmints! After them! [shooting and running] Varmint hole! Ah, nuh-unh! A ding dang varmint hole. I can't believe my sweeps didn't find it. Well you found it now. So, what next? [muffled] Next? We dig. Hmm. This looks like a delivery tunnel from the old rock-candy mines. Huh! We haven't been down here in hundreds of years. Remember when I'd get you out of those stinky Cheese Kingdom trade meetings and we'd sneak down here and spray-paint the walls? Um, I am pretty sure it was me who found you vandalizing my property. [Laughs] Yeah, but I got you to tag something, didn't I? I bet I could find it. Here, come on. We used to follow the mine car rails, cracking jokes, telling stories... Whoa! The broken bridge! Remember? You jumped across this! You were so scared. Mmm, I think I was just trying to prove something. Bonnibel Bubblegum, always so prepared. Yeah, I have to be "always so prepared." We can't all just "wing it." I didn't have to always worry about so many things, you know? The Candy Kingdom used to be so small, so manageable. But then it kept growing and growing, and there was always some new disaster to prepare against. Is that why you stopped talking to me? No, I... [growls, hisses] Bring it, ya darn pumpkin munchers! It's a freaking mother varmint! Ugh! Marcy, cover me! No problem. Marceline! Look out! Huh? She's going to bring the whole tunnel down! My snapback! In there! You got any more gadgets? Umm... Some bandages, a pen, unpaid internet bill, and a strawberry lip balm. [slurps] Ah. Maybe we can find something useful around... Oh! Your tag! We actually found it. Man, your handwriting hasn't changed at all. [chuckles] Still as prissy and prim as... What? [sobs] Hey, hey, whoa. Wait, I didn't mean... I like your handwriting. I think it's realy pretty. It's... it's not that... I lost my hat. We can get you another hat. I lost my hat, lost my home, lost my people. I can't even keep darn varmints out of my pumpkin patch! Oh, Bonnie, you're... I tried. I really, really tried. I just... I thought that if I shut everything out and just focused on work, it would all be okay, but look where that landed me. All I managed to do was push everyone away. I pushed you away. I'm sorry, Marceline. I've been a real dinger to you. Come on. What are you even apologizing for? Uh, how about we not get buried under a metric ton of rock-candy rubble? The field generator! Aw, geez! Okay, uh, maybe I can rig up a graffiti bomb or a rudimentary rock-candy cannon or... what? This time, I'm prepared. I've been watching these dudes pretty close. I think I can varmint-style dig us through the wall. It's just a shame about your tag, I don't want to mess it up. Nah, it's good, I think. Mess it up. Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig! Yo, varmints! You hungry? I'll eat you! I'll eat your mom! I'll eat your eggs! I'll... Whoop! Thanks. [slurps] Boing! I'm crazy tired, Marceline. I think I have been for a long time. [sighs] But those varmints are still out there, waiting. Eh, worry about it tomorrow. I'll keep a lookout tonight. I'll watch the heck out of this pumpkin patch. Come on. [yawning] Well, okay. Maybe for a bit. Don't let me sleep too long. Promise to wake me up in 15 minutes. I promise. Uh, can I come back now? What's up? Nothing, I don't know. If anybody wants tea, it will be ready in a few minutes. Evil...evil...evil...evil...evil! Whoa, Flame King! Father! Oh, well, uh... Sorry, I... thought my daughter was alone... Well, I'll just be going now. Nice teapot. Ooh! What was that? He was saying "evil, evil, evil" over and over again. Yeah, I heard. Well, I wasn't sure if you heard him 'cause he was whispering. Yeah, I heard. Ugh, he's so annoying. Well, I was just trying to help. Oh, not you, Jake, my dad. I always catch him whispering stuff in my ear while I'm not paying attention. He keeps saying I'm evil. Whoa, you best not be believing that whack bunk. I bet he's trying to make your life bad, so you'll think you're evil. But you're really not! How can I know for sure? Dungeons. What? Let's have a good time in a dungeon or something, that always clears my head that reminds me what's what. And that will make me good? No, that will show you not to worry so much, because you're already good in here. Ok, yeah, let's do it. Dungeons! Dungeons! Chamomile tea! Is this how you look for a dungeon? Yeah... a lot of times the entrances are hidden, so you gotta look under rocks and stuff for a secret switch. Sometimes it takes a while... Hmm. I'll just use my heat sense. That tree over there is not made of wood. Really? Yes! Ooh... gauntlet. Thanks for taking me out Finn. No prob, Bob, light this for me, will ya? [She does so.] Oh, sure. Um... do we need a torch? I'm sort of made of fire. Oh...well, I guess torches are just cool for dungeons, you know? Oh, okay. Yeah...I like to hang on to it. Boy, this place is creepy! Really? I feel like it's trying too hard. Gold piece! [Grabs a gold piece he found on the ground and puts it in his pocket] Oh, you mean, like, with all the skulls? Whoa! Whoa! What? Hey! What are you doing here? Burning you alive! Haha no, no, wait a sec. Sorry, one second. Sure. He might have an important loot on him, so we don't wanna just burn him up; plus it's a little cruel even for an evil guy, check this out. [Threatens him with his sword] RRRAAA, you're gonna surrender! Okay, okay, I surrender!!! I shall grant thee clemency! If you do the splits! Do the splits! I-I can't-I can't do the splits. Do the splits, thou milk-livered maggot pie! Okay, okay...Ow, ow, ow! [Does the splits] See, a lot of times you can overpower these guys with confidence. Neat! Got any loot on ya? Just this map. It'll-it'll help you. Ha! See? This would've been burned! Yeah, no, that makes sense. What else you got?! Yeah! Uh, uh, there's a treasure chest in the corner, please stop yelling. Hah, hah! I knew it. [The chest won't open] Oh, cram it to the butternuts, it's locked! Aahh! I don't know were the keys is, please don't yell! Hahaha, alright. We can come back to that later. [To FP] Hey, are you having fun? Mhm. I- I'll just stay here. [starts running] Race you to the next monster! WHOA, whoa! What? [chuckles] That's not how you do things in a dungeon. You gotta sneak. Sneak? Like this. [Starts walking and crouches. FP follows behind and does the same] And you gotta look around. [He does so.] [They reach a wall and [whispers] Ok, this guy's too big to intimidate, but I have a plan. First, you shoot some fire at that rope, the chandelier falls, we distract the monster and we run in. Element surprise. [Whispers] Wow. You ready? Yeah. [Takes a step and retracts] Before we go in, how good are you at quietly throwing a tiny bit of fire? Uhh... what? Like on a scale of 1 to 100, how good are you at quietly throwing a tiny bit of fire at a rope 50 feet away? Uhh... Scale of 1 to 100. [Thinks] 42. [Normal voice] 42?! [Whispers] Well, I don't know! I've never rated myself before. [Whispers] Well, that's cool, that's cool. Just try to hit that rope. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm good. it's a hologram. Oh. Neat. So, uhh, should we keep going? Yeah, although it does raise the question. Why would someone go through the trouble of setting up a hologram? Unless... they've hidden something in this room? [Crouches down on the floor and starts looking.] [sees FP sleeping] Hey, wake up. I was meditating. [Stands up] Look what I found. [Holds up a key.] A key! We have to go back? We don't have to, we get to! Come on. [walks away.] See? That didn't take long at all. Now we get treasure. Okay. [Sticks key through the keyhole and doesn't open] Nope. This key's for something else. Haha. Oh, well. [Continues singing.] [Thinking] Jeez. This is kinda boring. At least he's walking fast. See? That's where I found the key. Snapdragons!! Take my place, take my place! Take my- [Flame Princess stumbles back and burns it in defense.] Scatter fire! [Sends four bolts of fire that meet in the middle and burn the cage completely to ashes. She sighs.] No, no, we shake them down first, remember? He... wanted me to take his place. [Rummages through pile of ashes] Man. Ooh, hold on. [Finds another key and holds it up.] Ha ha! It's another key! Now we get to go back to the beginning! [Runs.] Whoohoo! Finn, I'm not having any fun. [Stops running] What? Why? Well, you keep wanting me to do things your way. But I don't like doing things your way. Is that because I am evil? What? No, wait, that's... no! Uhh, hey, you know what? Let's do things your way. Really? Yeah. I've been acting an uncouth lout, m'lady. [Throws torch in the water] Okay, so there's a door over there. What do you wanna do? I... burn it down. [Makes a Flame Sword and marks a big X on the door. Finn looks unsure as she breaks through the door.] Okay, that worked. Now what do you do... [Runs and shoots fire at random places] RRAAAAAGGGHHH!! Uhh... [Scared] Good- good job, FP. Thanks, FTH! Haa! [Shoots more fire. Goo skulls start appearing. FP rushes to the door.] Ughh, doors! Burn, burn, burn! [She is stopped by a Goo Skull.] Huh? Ugh. Oh, Sham man. It's the legion of Goo Skulls! Uh, how do you defend? Uhh... snake fire!! [Her fire ignites their goo and destroys them.] Fire burn goo. Yes! Feel my flames, puny worms! [Laughing] The power of destruction! Woh. [Giant Goo Skull comes out from behind Huh? [turns around in normal state and sees Finn being taken away by a Giant Goo Skull] Ahh!!! [Being spun around by goo] Help me! But don't use fire because you'll- mphh! [Muffled by the goo] Release him or feel the wrath of the Princess of Flames! Very well. [Stops just in front of the Giant Goo Skull] Do the splits! Do the splits, thou milk-livered maggot pie! [Grabbing Finn's demon sword and yelling] [Giant Goo Skull does the splits] [Using Finn's demon sword to free Finn from a goo] Hot Daniel! Flame Princess. I thought you were going to burn me alive. No way! I'd never do that to my boyfriend. [Finn blushes] Ha, thanks Finn. That was a really awesome experience. Dungeons totes clear your head, right? [Agreeing] I forget how good it feels to destroy stuff. [Confused] Uhhhh..... I mean, like evil stuff. Oh yeah, cool. We should go again sometimes. Do you know any other dungeons? Maybe next time we should just go to like... a farmer's market. And burn it. Hmm, try this key. What is it? Don't forget LSP's diet cola. I won't. I really do love Okay, everybody. Apple juice for Tree Trunks. [She takes the juice] Diet soda for LSP. [Taking the soda] Ehh. What did you order, PB? Oh, I brought my own. [Shows a drink that has a face] Huh. Ice latte for my lady. [Gives Lady her drink] Tomato juice for Marceline. [Gives it to Marceline, who's floating in midair] Thanks, Finn. Hot cocoa for BMO. [Takes the cocoa] This does compute. And finally, a thimble of milk for Shelby, the worm who lives in Jake's viola. You can just call me Jake... We're so excited that you could be here tonight for Finn and Heat Signature 3. Oh, with the submarine? Sounds great. 재밌겠는데? (It looks like funny) Get on with it! Princess Bubblegum's in my seat. We decided last time No reserved seating. First come, first served. Grr. [Sips her drink] What's that? Just stuff that comes at the beginning of the movies. Yeah, that's on all the movies we dig up. I don't know. It seems pretty important, Finn. Alright, let's take a look. Pause, BMO. "Warning. Federal law provides severe and criminal penalties for the unauthorized exhibition of copyrighted motion pictures." Alright, well, goodbye. Sorry we had to cancel. [They close the door] We've been showing these films unauthorized. But these movies are before the Great Mushroom War. We should still respect authority, mang. Yeah? Are we meeting next week to watch a movie? Uhh... Uh, yeah. Maybe. I think so. Finn, don't cancel movie club! I've literally been having the time of my life. 아, 너무 좋았는데. ("Oh, I enjoyed that so much!") Calm down, y'all. We're gonna have Dude, we've never found a movie without that warning. We're not gonna find a movie, Jake. Well, what are we gonna do? [Finds a camera and gasps] We're gonna make one! Wowp! Movie filming time! Okay, BMO. Turn to your right, and start filming. Start to truck in. Keep going. Keep truckin' in, BMO. Huh? That was awesome, BMO. Yeah. Fantastic, super. Don't lose her, BMO! Front shot! Front shot! Film the clouds. Don't forget the little one. BMO! BMO, you're gonna miss it! Over there to your right. Oh, we're gonna miss it. Hurry, BMO! Don't lose it. Oh, it looks like it's gonna fall. Follow it! Look over there. Across the river. BMO, forget about the coin. Film that over there! Zoom in. [BMO does] Weird. Let's get some more footage. Like that? Yeah, perfect. Are you, are you sure? Yeah, look great. W-w-wait. How about this? That's even better! Uhh, what do you think? I don't get it. It's just a bunch of random junk. Yeah, I'm not engaged. I need to see something that reflects life as it is, but, you know, entertaining. Yeah, like a romantic comedy. Exactly. An action adventure. Wait, that's not what I said. Let's get to filming! [Through his megaphone] Okay, Slime Princess! In this scene, you're gonna leap over to that vine, swim over the crocodiles, do a triple flip with a full twist and land clean. Don't fall in the water, or you'll get eaten alive. Action! No! No smooching! Cut. I thought it was great. No, we can't use any of it. I think we should use all of it. No, not all. We should throw away the parts where Slime Princess was smoochin'. That was dumb. What? Duuuumb-ah. [Pronouncing the "b"] Okay, you're having a picnic, you're in love but you can't admit it. So you're having a playful food fight. And action. Why did you do that? Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut, that was not what I wanted! That was awesome! We need to shoot more stuff like that. [Sigh] What's next? Okay PB, move back a little. [She does] Stop. [Repositions the frog and the chariot] Finn. Yeah. How does this work? Umm, Jake's gonna get the frog to hop toward him [Jake is standing with a stick with a fly tied to it] and when he does, you're gonna run along side the chariot and it's gonna look like you're driving it. Okay. Hey, Finn. Yeah. How 'bout when the chariot takes off, she says something like, "Mmm, check, please." What? No, that's terrible. [Jake looks annoyed] And action! Check, please...? Hah, Jake. You... you brought the fly in too close! I'm sorry. Well, help me catch 'im. Well, I thought it was funny. This isn't a comedy! Not the way you're shootin' it. Look, just help me catch this guy. All right, but after this we do my part. [Through a megaphone] Okay, everyone. It's been a long day. A lot of... [Chuckles] A lot of running around, chasing frogs [chuckles again]. But we are makin' a movie, and this is the big wedding scene. Mr. Cupcake, you're playing Todd Johnson. Yes. And Lady, you confess that you never loved Todd Johnson and that you were just trying to win a bet with your snooty socialite friends. 알았어, 제이크. ("Okay, Jake.") And then, you both realize you do love each other and you both say "I do." And then Shelby, you say... Check, please. Heh, heh, heh. Yeah. Don't forget to look right at the camera and slap your cheeks like this. [Slaps his cheeks] And 1, 2, 3 action! Do you, Todd Johnson, take this Rainicorn to be your lawfully married wife? Lady! Cut! Cut, cut, cut! [To Mr. Cupcake] I didn't tell you to flex out! [Rubs Jake's head] 자기야, 흥분하지 마. ("Don't take it seriously, honey.") No, I don't like the way he's flexing at you. I don't hear her complaining. Why you... GAAH! Check, please. How much longer till you finish editing, BMO? About twenty hours. Twenty hours?! Yeah, you guys shot a lot of footage. About twenty hours. Jake, let's talk about our movie. Okay. I think we shot a lot of great stuff. Uh-huh. But I'm thinkin' only half of it is usable. Me, too. Really? Yeah, I was just thinking that. That's great! I know. You actually agree it's an action adventure! Yep, it—wait! No! What? Romantic comedy! What?! What do you mean "what"?! Who's right, BMO? Yeah, me or Finn? We'll ask him when he wakes up. Why wait? [Pulls out a pen and paper and begins writing] "Dear BMO, Please use only the best footage when cutting the movie. Love, "And See you at the movie club, then. Oh, I'll be there. As will I. As will I, as well. Yes. Oh, yes. Oh, I can't wait. Oh, I can't wait! Heh heh. Alright, thanks again everyone for coming to... [Singing] movie night! I hope y'all are in the mood to laugh. I hope y'all are ready to be on the edge of your seats for tonight's action adventure film. It's, ahh, it's more of a romantic comedy. Right, BMO? Eeee... Well, I guess we'll see! Yeah, I guess we will. Start the movie, BMO. [Whispering] It's a little awkward. [Whispering] Oh, my gosh! BMO's right. Fighting over this movie junk is dumb. I'm sorry, man. Me too, dude. Oh, my gosh, you guys. I can't wait till next week's movie club. Check, please. That's a good one, BMO! Denise, we have concluded you're an interesting and conventionally hot woman. My siblings and I would like to request a date with you. Are you available for a date with Glob on Saturday, Grod on Friday, Grob on Thursday or Gob on Sunday? Please select your dates now. Ahhh-rooo! That's nice. Eat it, Lich! Eat it, Lich! Woooh! What?! No more crackers? Eeeee. [He runs over to Prismo] Prismo! Prismo! Hey man, Hey! Heeeey. Bad news, you ran out of cheese crackers. What! No. Yeah, man, what are you going to do about it? [ Jaaake. [laughs] I'm Prismo, you make me happy, Prismo. [shyly] Oh, stop. I'm always smiling when I'm around you. I just noticed that. I always am. I'm always smiling when I'm around you, too. [giggles] This feels so good. Peppermint Butler! Death! What's up. Hey umm, those guys are doing selfies on The Lich.[The camera goes towards the Lich with Grob Gob Glob Grod taking a selfie on him] Is that safe? Definitely going to send these to Denise. Oh yeah, it's fine, he's harmless. Yeah, but why isn't he killing everyone in the room right now? Controlling our minds, making us rip each others eyes out while we buttercup one another? Well, The Lich's primary function is to cause mass death. And since he can't do that while he is trapped in my Time Room, [zooms in to The Lich with Grob Gob Glob Grod taking numerous selfies on him still] he's stuck in a standstill, like a machine without a purpose. I am so scared right now. Yikes. Aw, don't worry, he ain't gonna hurt nobody. Ha! You got a cup on your head. Ha-ha, you dingus! [laughs] See, he's docile as a lamb. [perks up] Hmm. Well, okay, then I guess I can go for a selfie, too. Yeah, man, make your dreams come true. Oh, what time is it? [looks around] Hey, yo, Clock Face, what time is it?! It's 1230. Aw, boo to that! Yo, Prismo I gotta get back before Finn realizes I'm not home. He gets worried if I stay out too long. All right, later, dude. Laters. Jake, where were you? [nervously] I was, umm, in the, uh... All right, man, I'm gonna come clean. I've been doing a lot of partying at Prismo's lately. Come on, man! I don't even take Lady up there. Dude, I found out my human dad is still alive. Whoa, what? [sits up on bed] He's at some place called the Citadel. Whoa. [ I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't. Maybe there's a good reason why he didn't raise me. Like, he was probably captured by thieves and kept a slave for years. Yeah, or maybe he was ambushed in the wild and hid you so you wouldn't be captured, too. Yeah, maybe it's better not to rock the boat. But... it might also be good to find out if you have any genetic risk factors or allergies or whatever. Plus, you get to see what you'll look as an old guy. Could be cool. Heh. I guess it would be okay to meet him, just to know what I'll look like. Cool. Oh! If we hurry, Prismo might be still partying. Come on, just one more game. I don't know, mang, I was just gonna clean up and crash out. [he jumps up and down] Oh, yeah! More players! You guys wanna play some Card Wars? [waits] No. Prismo, we need to get to the Citadel. Whoa! You guys do not wanna go there. Seriously. [A remote materializes beside Hey, my dad must be like the warden there. I know you can't grant Finn and me any more wishes. So, we brought Shelby along to wish on our behalf. Hello. Oh, look at that, a little guy. So, I wish for ... a pony for my GF! Done. [upset] Shelby! Sorry, dudes. My girl's been hounding me for a pony for months. I'm gonna get mad points for this. [ [sadly] Dang, Shelby. A wish wouldn't have worked anyway. You can only get to The Citadel committing a cosmic crime. So, what do we gotta do? Rob a cosmic bank? Steal a space baby? [starts to pick up his game of Card Wars] Oh, uh, I just remembered I gotta go home. Gotta groom my feathers [He moves towards the door at Prismo's feet] Goodbye! Goodbye! [he flies out] Listen, if you guys are serious about this, [short breath] all you gotta do is find a certain sleeping old man and bring him here. That's it? Yep. He's on one of those floating islands out there. It kind of looks like an upside-down duck. That doesn't seem much of a crime. Yeah, but that's all there is to it. [quietly] For now. What? Check it out! I got gifts for you guys. Ha, cool it's a penlight. [He starts flashing it around saying "pizoo, ziiuo, vroom"] Jake, don't look directly me in the—Aaah! [clears throat] Come on, Finn let's go find this old guy. Oh! One last thing, dudes. [softly] Whatever you do, don't wake him up. [quietly] Okay, you can go now. [while flashing the penlight] Pew! Pew! You ever wonder what happened to make a place all wrecked up like this? Nope. Hey, upside-down duck! No, wait, it's right side up. Aha! [He makes his hand large and knocks loudly as he talks loudly] Hey! Get out here, old man! [whispering] Dude, shh. Don't wake him up. [shrinks head only speaking softly still knocking relatively loud] Hey, get out here, old man. Pizow! [His penlight shines on the old man who is on a bed covered in his hair except for his bald spot the man turns over in his sleep] Old man. [whispering] Uh oh! [The nightmare version of Prismo comes out of his mouth and scratches the wall] Finn, a little help? Bizzow Gizzow Let's hoof it! Jake, don't jostle the package. Yahct! [He jumps and destroys them as well with his penlight] All right! [ There's too many of them! Let's see here. Oh, hey, your back. [normally] Dude's got serious night terrors. [normally] What now, Prismo? Okay, wake him up. Yeah, [soft] I just wanted one last look at myself. Wait, this old man is you? That's right So, wait, what happens to him when we wake him up? Poof! I'm a goner. Thus ends mighty [sadly] Prismo. Killing a wish master is a cosmic crime. Once I'm dead, the guardian will show up and take you to The Citadel. I don't think seeing my dad is worth sacrificing your life Ah, don't worry. As soon as my corporeal body falls back asleep again, [to himself] in a thousand years, [out loud] I'll be back. You sure about this? Hold on, let me take one last look around. Huh, thought I'd own more stuff by now. Okay, let's do it! Still feels like a bad idea, man. Pssh! What could go wrong? Wake up. Wa—Wait, I've changed my mind—[gasp] Prismo, don't worry! I'll put the old man to sleep and get you back! Dude! That means The Lich jacked our entry into The Citadel. Aw, no man, how are you gonna see your dad?! Hello? Who are you guys? Could any of you strangers tell me how to go home? I'm done with my nap. Old man Prismo. I just woke up from my nap, but I'm ready to go back to bed. I'd like to go home and take a nap. No, old man Prismo, don't talk to him. Are you my son? And when that salsa cloud had you by the tail...? Ha ha, yeah. And I swung him around into that golden cactus? [Laughs] Man, that was algebraic. Yeah, man, that adventure was tight. Yeah. I can't wait to get back home, though. Yeah, me, too! I need some sleep— I'm gonna play some Battle Wars with Neptr on BMO for an hour, then work on that flier for PB's laser recital and catch up on my correspondence with my pen pal Danny Gladiolas from over in Maryville. [Nods] Great minds. [Points to head] And then next what I'm gonna do is I'm— whoop! [Disappears down a hole] Finn? [Runs towards the hole] Finn! [Hits head on branch] Ohh! [Groans, stumbles backwards, and falls into another hole] Oh... What the...? Man, where's this supposed to be? Uh, excuse me? Sir? Hmm? Oh! You're awake! Oh, that's wonderful! Oh, thanks. Hey, where am I, anyway? Why, this is the famed Kingdom of Huge, of course. Heh. You fell through that crack in my ceiling and landed in a normal-sized pie. Mm-hmm. Well, my friend up top is probs pretty worried about me, so I'd best get going. Can you give me a boost back up to that crack or whatever? Oh-ho-ho! No, no, no. Don't be silly, child. Your friend must be on his way to find you right now. You should wait for him here, or you could miss each other. Hmm. I guess that does make sense. Of course! Besides, you're just in time to witness the chiming of my wondrous clock! It's set to do its chiming in merely an hour's time! [To himself,] "Krimber"? Come! Food boys! Shower our guest with the kindnesses of Huge! We will await the clock's chiming in style and comfort. Dig in, child! There's always more to come! Mmm. Oh! Apple scruffs! Just wait 'till you see my clock! Ahh, good, you're awake. [Gets up and walks toward Jake] Good good good good good. How you feelin'? Ohh... [Rubs head] My--my cabbage aches a little... What happened? [Sits down] Well, here I was, playing some Freecell, and then, wow! You fell down the hole, bounced off parachute #2, and landed on three ol' walnuts. Parachute? Hole? Walnuts? Fell down, wait! [Gets up] You mean we're falling right now? [Stretches up and to the left] Thanks for your help, buddy, but I gotta go. [Grabs onto Jake as his feet leave the platform] Woah, hold up! [Jake's reached the wall with My friend's still up top. He could be looking for me. Or, he could be in trouble and every second I'm down here I'm falling further away. I gotta get back. Uhhh, I think that's a pretty bad idea. You were unconscious while you were falling, remember? So you mighta been falling for weeks, or even months. [Platform falls further away] Trust me, it's possible. This is a very deep hole. If you try to climb out, you could run out of food. But, I've got to do something. I feel like you should probably not starve to death, so that when your friend comes looking, you're still alive. Mmm. You know I think you're right! [Stretches down to the platform] Finn is a pretty heroic kid, I gotta admit. He'll probably be here in half a gif. Oh, good, good. Well 'till then, please, make yourself at home. Here, [takes a walnut from under his hat,] have a walnut. [Takes the walnut] Thanks, man. I'm Hi, Jake. I'm Oh! [Claps and laughs] Oh! So marvelous! [Pulls at his face] Oh! [Throws his arms out and laughs] Ooh-hoo-hoo! Ah-ha-ha! Oh. Oh my, oh my. [Laughing] [Stands up.] Well, that was actually pretty cool, but I should probably get going. Wh-a-a-a-at?! But, how can you leave now? [Waves a hand at the clock] The clock is set to chime again in merely an hour's time! I feel like Jake should've been here by now. I mean, what if he's lost, or--or hurt? But... this is not the [Uses the food boys' ladder to get down from the chair] Sorry man. I've got my mind made up. [Gasps] Thanks for the food, though! Food boys! [Points] Seize the child! I'm sorry son, but this is for your own good. If you just stay put, all you need will come to you in time, like it has unto me. But, you must sit, you must wait. [The food boys tie Finn up with a huge spaghetti noodle] Yes, yes tie him up with normal spaghetti and bring him food, yes! [Laughs] Soon you will see, my boy! All good things come to those who wait. It started out as a day like any other. I was a door-to-door sales bear specializing in candles and playing cards, making my way to the Candy Kingdom like I'd done 200 times before. I guess my horse got stung by a bee or something, 'cause all of a sudden he just skronked the math out. We went off-road and I got thrown back into my wagon. When the shaking stopped I crawled out, only to find I was wedged deep in a hole and sinking fast. I had just enough time to rig up a parachute... ...And I've been falling ever since. Sometimes walnuts would fall into the hole, and sometimes rain. And I guess that was enough. [Eating walnuts on his stomach] Mm. So how did you pass the time? Well, for a long time I just waited to be rescued. [Hugging his knees] 599 Mississippi... 3,600 Mississippi... [Opens his eyes wide as though startled] But that was crazy boring. [In the present,] So then I got really into Freecell and things got a lot better. Freecell? Yeah, it's like Solitaire but there's very few unsolvable shuffles. Mm. It's a great game, great game. I really love it. [A beat] But it's nice, you know, to have someone I can play Freecell alongside of. Yeah, man. You know, also, I know some other card games we could play. You know, together. [Gasps, blushes, stifles a giggle with one hand] I forgot there were games like that! And then, there was another time--This was several years back--The clock chimed early, and I thought, "oh boy, here we go." But it turned out, one of the food boys had simply gotten wedged under... Finn! Huh? Are you listening?! Of course. Food boy in the clock. Huh. Yes. [Turns back to the clock] Anyway, as I was saying, one of the food boys had gotten himself wedged in the... [Thinking,] All right buddy, let's run through this again. 'Cause we're only gonna get one sht. When the clock strikes 12, I beckon kindly to yonder food boys. Hey, you guys like clean jokes? Then chuck some delicious food in their mouths. Having never before known generosity, they'll immediately make me their leader and undo my spaghetti. Ha ha! Then, with a perfectly timed serving tray, I'll deflect the hunter bot's brass arrow. Swift but delicate, the arrow will gain heft via the chandelier bat's filched asparagus. [Thinking,] Meanwhile, the serving tray from before has entered phase two, sending Ken Mangosteen careening into the clean silverware. But also, the asparagus arrow has caused a domino thing of food to happen, culminating in a huge lemon falling. It's not a perfect plan, but with a little luck, I think it's got a good chance. Hey, you guys like clean jokes? Ha ha! What the--Food boys, sieze the child! Finn?! Finn! There's nowhere to run, Finn. You know you'll never escape. [Laughs] [Reaches the top of the ladder and stops.] I'm not trying to escape anymore! [Runs down the shelf] I'm gonna murder your stupid clock, you psycho! [Gasps] No! Yup! Nooooo! ♪Crazy interest, Accumulate, Figures, Bigger interest ♪Warm scarves, To the hot house, Take your... socks off... [Gasps] Jake! [Looks up] Oh! Hey, Finn! Who's your new friend? He's not my friend, he's bad! He kidnapped the heck out of me! [Gasps] Why you... [Smugly,] What are you gonna do about it? Maybe I'll go ahead and kidnap you t--! Whoo! Hey, Seven. Now that you're out of that hole, what's the first thing you want to do? Hmm... Oh! I want a giant flipping hot dog. Mmm! Yeugh. [Turns to face forward] Don't you know those things are made out of, like, the grossest junk? Man, I don't give a toot! JAKE, WAKE UP! I FOUND A TRUCK! [opens an upstairs window] What? What's happening? Whoa! [picks up BMO and stretches them down to Finn] Where did ya get this baby? [rubs truck] I found it in the woods. I named it "Hot Daniel." Anyway, I figured we could do some pretty sick stuff with it. Oh, yeah? Like what? Hmm. I don't know. Launch it off some ramps, maybe get it going thirty miles per hour, crank the wheel into a gnar right-hander, spray dirt everywhere like a big hurkin' dirt wave? Yeah, buddy! [gives thumbs up] Nice! Let's crank this beast up. Can't—engine's busted, I think. Nuts. BMO, you know anything about cars? Nope. Hmm. Maybe... [shouts to upstairs window] Ice King, you know anything about cars? Nope. Not a car guy—too confusing. Got better things to do with my life. Hmm. Wait... I know someone who's good with mechanics. Hey! Hey, guys! Hi! Hey, Banana Man. Wow! I haven't seen you fellas since you destroyed my home, my land, and my rocket. Aw, jeez, yeah. Sorry, Banana Man—just sorta happened. Don't worry about it! Feh! Bygones! I'm just excited you called me over. We're neighbors. We should help each other out. I got the soda and the jams. Cool! [opens hood] I see the problem. The top of your engine is gone, specifically, the cylinder head. Hm. Okay. That word sounds cool... but what does it mean? Let me explain. [backs up as the background changes to a diagram] The cylinder head is the top to the cylinder block. [points to cylinder head] Think of the cylinder head as an airtight lid to your engine that regulates air, fuel, and exhaust. Okay. Cool. Informative. [whispers to Jake] What is he pointing at? Now this lid is important because it works to get fuel into your engine. [clears throat] You see, your engine has cylinders, and these cylinders are pistons. When the piston in the cylinder moves down, it creates a vacuum, pulling in fuel from the intake. You mean an air-fuel mixture? That's right, BMO. [puts a sticker on it] Have a gold star, dear. Yay! Then the piston returns to the top, compressing the air-fuel mixture. Then a spark plug fires off, creating an explosion, driving the piston back down, powering the engine. [clears throat] Sweet. So where's the cylinder head, then? Hmm. Well, sometimes people store parts they're working on in the car. [walks over to the bed of the truck and finds the part] Ah! Bingo! [brings it to Finn and Jake] Found it. Yeah! Drive time! Well... n-not quite. We don't know why they took the cylinder head off. Uh, it could be cracked, the gasket head could be warped, the rod bearings could have damage from water—you see, that's the cool thing about cars. [clears throat] One tiny little thing messes everything else up so nothing works! So it's up to us to figure it out! Cool. Yeah, alright. Whoo. I'm bushed. You guys wanna pick this up again in the mornin'? Sure. Sounds good! Not Okay, BMO. Good night, Banana Man. Have a good evening, gents. Time for the night shift. [turns on blowtorch] It's ten past the hour, and this is Graveyard Shift, hosted by me, Starchie the Gravedigger, your weekly five-hour dose of all the strange haints, phantasmagoria, and phenomena I see working in the Candy Kingdom Graveyard. Hello, caller. You're on the Graveyard Shift. What? Am I—oh, hi! Um, longtime listener, first-time caller. So, uh, I think Princess Bubblegum has been replaced by, like, a lizard person. A lizard? [starts drawing a picture] Yeah, a lizard. I love your show. Oh, [laughs] They are wrong! You look more like a hippo than a lizard. Well, um, my friend is a very highly-placed official in the Candy Kingdom, and I've noticed— Hi, BMO. [yelps] Stay back, lizard! Sorry, BMO. I-I didn't mean to startle you. I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about the truck... and biodiesel! Oh, and I figured out what's wrong with the engine block. So what are you working on? Aerodynamics. Swe-e-e-et! You know, it's been really nice hanging with you fellas and working on the car. [pats the roof of the truck] It gets a little lonely at my space-age banana dome. You don't have a girlfriend? No. I-I don't want to be alone, but... I've gotten pretty good at it. I putter around the house, keeping busy with my little projects. But it would be nice to find someone. Hold up. Princess? Is that you? [click] Ah, spooky. Yo, BMO. Coffee. Thank you. ["drinks" it] Car looks nice, BMO. Yeah. [snores] [wakes up] Uh! Ah! I fixed it! Are we best friends yet?! Oh. Oh, hey. I-I fixed it. [gives thumbs up] N-i-i-i-i-i-ice. I discovered the cylinder head was warped so I went to the junkyard and got a new one. [brings it out] Bingo. Whoo. Biodiesel. Yeah! Awesome! [laughs] [sees a female Banana Guard] Yow-ee-wow. [stops truck] She's beautiful. Well, then go over and talk to her. Yeah, come on, Banana Man! You're lonely! Oh, no, that's okay. Having someone to love takes up time I could use to work on stuff. That's the craziest thing I ever heard. [stretches his arm to the wheel and his foot to the gas pedal and drives the truck over to the guard] Pardon me, miss. My friend here is super smart, and he rebuilt this truck. He's very smart and very single! [uncertainly] Okay... Anyway, his name is Banana Man. If you like what you see, give him a call. [growls angrily] He-e-e-elp m-e-e-e-e-e-e! We gotta save Bubblegum! No, Finn! She's a lizard! You gotta stop listening to all those conspiracy shows. [twists his head] They twist up your noodle so you can't tell what's real. Look, there she is! [picks up Princess Bubblegum and places her in the bed of the truck] You want some tea? [pants] Sure! Thanks, Jake. So, what's up with the angry mob, PB? Oh, they think I've been replaced with an evil lizard replicant. It's sheer nonsense. [holding a bug] Eat this bug! [scream] [roars] [starts destroying the Princess Bubblegum's castle] [turns the car around] Punch it, 'Nana Man! [comes out of a manhole and sees Jake bouncing by] What the fridge? Finn, Jake! Reptilian synthoid replicants are trying to take over the kingdom! Yeah. We know. Kill it! No, no! I'm the real one! [crosses arms] Hmm... Hey, speedy. [pokes Banana Man with staff] You're comin' with me. What? Really? Mm-hmm... 'cause you ain't got enough peel on that 'nanner! You're under arrest for public indecency! Bye, Banana Man! [cries] It's not fair! It's okay, BMO. It's a very mild offense. It's not like that! Hot Daniel is dead! [excitedly] Stunts! [ Yo, Finn, look what I found! [ Dude, it's a spider web. Ohh. Well, cut me out, yo! No way, I'll stunt you out! Whoah! [He jumps at the web and gets stuck] ...I was thinking something else would happen. You got anything sharp? The only sharp thing I had was my fingernails, but you made me cut them. They were too long, Finn. Augh! You broke the skin, dude! I guess my fingernails are really loaaeaeuAAAAHH--! [ Oh, yeah. Sorry. It's cool, man. Can you... stretch us out of here? I'm gonna take a nap while you grow out your fingernails. We'll make our escape when I wake up. You'll never escape! [view shifts down revealing a That's the circle of life. That's not a circle. That's, like, a straight line. We don't make the rules, man. Well, don't just give up. The spiders are back! Try to stay calm. Greet your fate with dignity. We gotta go, Jake! Jake! So what? You're not talking to me now? No, I'm just tired of setting traps all day, solo-style. Why are you mad? I just said I was tired. But you're acting like you're mad. I'm not mad. Oh, look, food... that I caught... in my web... for us. I spin webs, too, Ed. Yeah, I know. I try just as hard as you. Well, go ahead then. Wrap them up for laters. [Barb looks shocked and looks down] What's wrong, Barb? What's going on there, Jake? [Jake snores, still asleep] I can't! You think I'm gross when I spin my web! What? I can see it on your face! Tell me that you don't! Uhh... I uh... You tell me, you don't find me gross! Oh, get stuffed, Ed! [She starts sobbing and walks away] You guys are sad. [Ed starts wrapping the still sleeping Jake with web, the web coming out makes a farting noise] Ugh! What is that sound? Sick, dude! She makes that sound, too? Yeah, I guess, but she never does it in front of me. [ Dude, that's not cool. You need to think about what you say and how that affects your lady. How about how she affects me? I love her, man. [ Can someone tell me why we fight, why she treats me like all I do is make her feel bad? Tell me, Glob, why don't you ever answer me!? It's hard to step outside of yourself when you're enmeshed with another being. [Noticing Wait! What? Umm... [Bug is panicking inside Ed's mouth] Right now, we gotta real-talk about your girlfriend. I don't real-talk with my food. Uhh... [ Yeah, right. You just wanna get out of my web. All you ever want to do is escape! You're always, like, in cahoots, makin' plans not to be food. I'm not in cahoots! So okay, eat your friend here. [ [ No, man! What?! Where's your heart?! Look inside yourself! This isn't you! [whispers] I'm gonna fake eat you, man. [whispers] Oh. Word. [scene shows Finn's teeth not touching [ [mumbles] Okay, first off, then, how you're going about this isn't working. Am I right? Ugh, yeah. It's not working. My way sucks. [mumbles] Cool, now we've gotta do damage control. Healing the negs energy at the source. Yes, heal the neg-jerseys in me. [mumbles] Alright, uhh... [mumbles] Go find Barb a present. That'll fix the first neg. Can you do that? Yeah, I can find her a present. If you think that'll help. I don't think it will, but what do I know, I'm just a big ol' dummy who does everything wrong... [ Whee! You're free! [Bug falls back in the web and gets caught again] Aw, man. It's okay, Finn. You bought us some time. Yeah, think fast, what can we use? There's nothing! Just a bunch of nature. I have a dumb idea. [ Alright, one... two... three! Yo what? Shoot! Here comes another one. One two three! My eyes! Agh!! [The bird falls through the air into Finn's hand] Ha ha, yes! Finally! [The scene widens showing dozens of spit covered birds surrounding the web] Good job! Last chance for life. Break out! [ Hey, what's going on here! [ Nothing. [The bird escapes Where's Ed? Oh, uh, he's getting you an "I'm sorry" gift. He feels crazy about making you cry. He does? Really? Barb! Barb! Ed? Barb, look! Damage control! Check it out! I wrapped it up and everything! Oh, Ed, I can't believe it! Yeah! Come on, open it! I really just, it's just so unlike you to-- [ It's a sword! I found it in the woods! In the woods? Yeah, it's magical, though. Check out the blade! You got this for you, Ed. No, I got it for us! For snuggles by the fire! We are never gonna snuggles until you learn to appreciate me! [She points the sword at his face] Oh, really? Well, I guess we're never gonna eat again either 'cause I catch the food, and your butt is dysfunctional! Eeh-ya! [He grabs the sword from Barb and cuts everyone out of the web] Go! Run away, food! We don't need you apparently! [The bugs start flying away] Just break up, you guys! Do it for you! Now what are you gonna eat? Huh, Barb? [Close up of Yo, that's wrong! Who cares! We're free! Oh, no. You got that look on your face. You going back to help that fool? His wife's gonna eat him! Spider marriage is complicated. Sometimes, you just gotta mind your own biz. [in the distance] Oh, help, somebody help me! Ugh... Go with Glob. Mercy! You little twerp! Are you stupid or something? Yeah, I'm stupid. But I know something real. You shouldn't eat your husband! [ Not exactly... [ What is happening!? Something we're not supposed to see. Oh, Ed. We're parents! Aw, sick! I think there's hope for us, Barb. We can make a new start, as a family. [They kiss] Nice. Think they're gonna make it? Love like theirs will always find a way. It'll crawl all up over you and drain your body fluids, poisoning you slowly until you pass out. [Finn starts screaming and flailing his arms] Circle of life, Finn... circle of life. Our secret mission to capture the Ice King is underway. Though I probably shouldn’t say stuff like that out loud. [Singing] Who is it? [Starts shooting ice lightning] Zap zap zap zap zap zap zap! [Sees a can on the ground] Ooh, someone left me a gift. Peanut brittle? But I'm on a diet. [Shakes can, snickers and opens the can; Jake pops out and takes his crown] Should have stuck to your diet! [Throws can on the ground] Oahh! Finn, you have destroyed my faith in canned peanut brittle! Zap! [Nothing happens] Oh, no, my crown has all my powers in it! [Tackles Ice King with a giant wrapper strip] Wrap attack! [In baby talk] How about I swaddle you up like a sweet baby. We finally captured the Ice King! [With Ice King tied to his back] Why'd we do this again? Princess explained it all when she sent us on the mission, remember? Go capture the Ice King, and bring him to me. Hmm… That didn't really explain anything. I'm sure she's got a good reason. Where is everybody? Yeah, this place is deserted, except for that guy. Ich bin hier, Finn. ("I'm in here, Finn.") It's me, the princess. Did you bring him? Sure did. So, what did the Ice King do to— [cutting him off] Ah-bababap! No time! Now quickly, with me! Ttubllaw! What's the password? [Laughs] Oh, you got me! [Opens his mouth into a doorway] Secret door! This stairway leads to the dungeon where we'll toss that lousy Ice King! What awful thing did he do to get tossed in there? Chhh, he didn't do anything. Not a thing. Wha? It's a long story, Finn. You see, the Ice King… [Over an intercom] Princess Bubblegum, you're needed at once in the Grand Hall. No! I need more time! [Flips over a table] [Hanging over on a tree with a bullhorn] Gosh, I'm sorry. Alright, alright, I have to go. You two just guard the Ice King until I return [Creepily] and be prepared to make him howl with pain. You got it, princess! Oh, this is a total rook! Settle down, prisoner! We gotta record your belongings. One magical crown, [Whispers to Finn] probably stolen. I didn't steal it! I made that item! …Made it with the magic that I stole! So hand it over, or I'll strike menacing poses at you! [Starts striking poses and Finn sprays him with a hose] Cool it, inmate! [The water begins to whip Ice King] These bars can't hold me forever! Hey there's only like two of 'em. You fools have no business guarding prisoners. Oh, yeah?! Well how 'bout these helmets we found? And we got the Oculus of Rehabilitation! Hmm? Be better! And the shelf of penitence! [Sobbing] I'm sorry…I'm so sorry… How about you just hand me my crown. I'll create some ice bars. [Running with the crown] Okay! No, Jake! It's a trick. I'm toying with you, ha ha, psychologically. [laughs] Finished! So what am I being charged with? Umm… Five counts of jerkateering. Ha! Yeah, what does it matter? Gah! Of course it matters! The way things work is first, I transgress your meaningless rules and then you maliciously persecute me! That makes sense. You do bad stuff, we punish you. [Pokes Finn's face] Fool! You have disrupted that order, for—are you ready for this?—I have committed no recent crime! Really? Umm… [Laughs] I'm rockin' your worldview! Jake, he is starting to convince me we're doing a bad thing. Dude, [Licks him] be calmed by my saliva and think of all the terrible things he's done. Yeah… yeah! You're still a jerk that deserves to be in jail. Oh, yeah? You know who really deserves to be in jail? I will show you the true jerks! [Pulls out a mirrored covered with a blanket behind his jail cell bunk bed] Behold! [Lifts the blank off the mirror but in doing so extinguish the candle in the cell] Uhh, it's too dark. Behold! [Brings the mirror into the light but it shatters at the bottom when he slams it on the floor] Wha, Behold! [Holds it in the air but it falls apart, The jerks are us? Jake, am I going crazy? It seems like the Ice King is right about this. But if he's in the right, that means we're in… The Candy Kingdom! No, it means much, much worse. On your feet. [Gets out of bed] Is it time for my hour in the yard, boss? No, we're letting you go. We decided that it's wrong to imprison you. This is a trick, huh? Get out of here before I change my mind! [Walking out of the cell] There must be someone waiting outside to beat me. Ooh, is that my crown over there? [Goes offscreen] [Sighs] I'm glad that's all taken care of. No, quite yet. Awww… Sorry, but since we're the bad guys this time, we gotta go to jail. This sucks. Hey! Get out of my room! You're still he— [stutters] …Just get out of here, man! So, you're really breaking me out? Like I said, it's wrong to imprison you. [Tearing up] You mean, you believe me? Oh, can it be? Has all the hatred between us transmuted into something more? A friendship? A best friendship. [Sticks out fist for a fist tap] Knucks? [Finn slaps his fist away] Oh, ho ho, slaps in disgust, eh? Let's call them "Slappy D's"! Okay, see you later, my bosoms! I am no man's bosom. Cast "Detect Secret Door"! [He shoots a magic blast and a tunnel opens under the stairway] Success! [Runs away into the tunnel] Wa ha ha ha! Sorry for the delay. Man, there are a lot of secret door around here. [Puts on pink iron gloves] And now, Ice King, prepare to howl with [Sees he's gone] pain? Wow, she's so proud we did the right thing, she almost looks enraged. [Takes off the gloves] Where is the Ice King? Finally! Freedom and friends FOREVER!!! What have we done? I'LL SHOW YOU. [Carries them away] AHHH!!! Heah, even old A plague of Freezer Burn Flu. Ice King did this? Well, yes and no. [Narrating] It happened 3 days ago. Hey, hey, Princess, check out my new trick! [Starts rubbing flakes out of his beard] It's snowing it's snowing for you! [Narrating] We don't think he was trying to spread disease, but soon the entire kingdom was infect by his beard flakes. [Narrating] Through my research, I quickly discovered that the only way to cure my people was to obtain the pained howls of the Ice King himself. [Narrating] But when I pleaded with him directly… Please, I beseech your aid. In the name of common decency! So let me get this straight… You're hitting on me. No! 으으, 웃기시네! 너는 우리 공주님과 판결 상대도 안 될 그런 가치없는 놈이야! ("Are you joking? You are not even worth my Lady's disdain.") I think I heard the word "Virile" in there. Oh, she is definitely hitting on me. No! 말도 안 돼! ("No!") Be gone, you biddies! [Narrating] He had his chance to help and he did nothing! Oh, my gosh, she came to me this time. I had no choice but to try and take his wails by force. By getting us to beat the tar out of him. I can't just beat up the Ice King for nothing. That's against my alignment. I know, I know. You're right. [Starts to cry] But I'll get him to give up those howls. Voluntarily. I swear it. Oh, thank you, Finn. I… [Cries] [Places hand on her face] Shhhh… Dude, how are we gonna get those howls? Oh, I gotta plan to trick him, but you won't like it. That sounds ominous. I don't like it! Ice King, come forth! I'm coming forth! Hee hee, is that the voice of friendship I hear? [Walks in the room with a board game] So, are you fellas ready for game night? Game night? Well, that's weird. What? Why? You do know how friends act, right? You've had friends before. I… yes? Yeah, so you know how friends are always howling in pain for each other. Yeah… right! Everyone knows that! [Laughs awkwardly] [Holds up the sound device] Will you howl for me, pal? Oooh, of course, friend. Awoo-hehehehe! Oh, I've got the sillies! I couldn't possibly without giggling uncontrollably. I'm just so giddy about you being here! [Laughs, falls on his back and grabs the bottom of his cloak and rocks back and forth] I'm a banana! [Laughs] Don't slip on me! We're out of options. Let's just beat it out of him. No, Jake! We… [Gets up] Wait a sec, there's a bug on you, friend. Smack! [Smacks Jake and in doing so hits Finn] Grrr… Biscuits, now's my chance! [Shuffling through the board game, picks up a game piece] You know, I carved these game pieces from my own teeth. Boo hoo, boo hoo, boo hoo, boo hoo… Huh? Crying?! Boo hoo. You hit me, Ice King. I don't think I could live any more knowing my best bosom hit me. I was only saving you from poo poo palms! I'm dying because I know you care not for me. [Plays dead] No! No, my…my bosom! What hath I done?! My friend! [Picks up Finn] My only friend. Hey, what about me? Why?! Why?! WHY?!!!  They're all getting better! Finn and Jake did it! Ich bin so glücklich, ich könnte, ich könnte… ("I'm so happy, I could, I could…") [Almost flips over a cot but faints on it] WHY?!!!… Ah, well. Gunter! Dispose of Finn's carcass. [Sad] Harumph. Good job! Those wails must have reached all the way to… Did you see how fast he dropped my lifeless body? That's just mean. Finn, if I came across your lifeless body, I'd clasp you dramatically for a kajillion years. Thanks, man. [Grows] Hey, why wait?! Play dead, Finn! Why?! Heh heh heh heh. Why?! Heh heh heh heh. Why?! Adventure time! Hey, man. [Chuckles deviously] What's so funny? Oh, you know, just takin' this garbage bag of butter... [Grunts] ...into the house. [Chuckles again] Dude. That's not that funny. [Jake throws the garbage bag at HAHAHAHAHA! Ohhh, butter pranked! I can't believe I didn't see that coming! Heh, yeah, I'm a genius. You have offended my honor, sir, and in so doing, you have awoken the pranking demon that sleeps in my pits! The demon is coming for you, mortal. It is going to prank you... so... HARD! Whatever. I'm gonna take a day long nap. [Yawns and walks towards the door] That's right, suckah! Go nap it up, for when you awake, the pranking demon will be upon you! [Jake shuts the door.] [To himself] Aww, man! Nothing's better than throwing a big bag of butter at someone! [Sighs] Gotta think! What's... a better prank... than butter?! Answer me, book! What's better than butter?! A unicorn. [Turns page] A treasure hunter! [Turns page] A battleship! [Turns page] A pie! [Turns page] A young girl in lo—Wait! Book, rewind! [Turns back a page] That's it! I'll throw never-ending pies at Jake's face forever! [Laughs evilly] It's never-ending pie-throwing time! C'mon, dude! Turn on! [It doesn't respond.] Why isn't it working?! [Throws it] I'll never make a prank better than Jake's garbage bag full of butter. [Lightning strikes the machine] Ouch! Holy stuff! It talked! Wow-cow-chow! Greeting, creator! Oh, whoa! Hey, man! My name is Oh, perfect! You're exactly the kind of robot I was trying to make! Creator, I am eager to commence the creation and propulsion of pies forever, but my pie-hucking appendage is... malfunctioning, and my oven lamp is cold, and my tank treads do not roll! They only do skids! Why, creator?! [Finn gasps.] Does it please you to watch me struggle?! Neptr! Don't say stuff like that! Look, I know we just met, and you're probably goin' through a lot of personal stuff right now, but I really like you, Neptr, and I'm not gonna rest until you're working properly and throwing hot pie on my best friend's face. Together, we're gonna prank the poots out of Jake! Haha! I'll always love you, creator! I know you will, Neptr. Now, all we need is more lightning power so you can be operating at full capacity! And I think I know just the dumb-hole who we can get some from. Ooh, what beautiful piles of sugar! Heh. No, Neptr. We call that snow. Snoooow?? UNH! [Crashes into the Ice King's lair, and balloons float up] Did y'all smack me into that mountain on purpose? Yeah! Take note, Neptr. These guys are grade-A pranksters. You guys hang out in case we need a daring escape! I got his wallet. [All the balloons laugh.] Just gotta sneak around until we find his lightning bolt stash. But, creator, is not breaking and entering wrong? No, we're pranking and entering, which is awesome! Sneaking! We're sneaking... [Whispering] Shush, Neptr! Sneaking... Shh! Sneaking... Neptr, you're gonna get us caught! Sneaking! Is that you, honey? [Finn runs away before he can see him.] How was your day at work? [Mock-female voice] Terrible! How could I possibly stand to be apart from you, the Wenk. Game time! [Activates Battle Babe.] Kill the frog! Kill the frog! C'mon! Oh, he's right in front of you! Lower! L—[Scoffs] Stupid lady. Kill it... Creator, if we get caught, I want you to know that I will always love you. Shh! You already told me that! And we're not getting caught! We're gonna get you working so you can prank Jake! He could wake up from his nap at any second! I might wake up at any moment! Naaaah, I'm still asleep. No, no! That frog is casting magic missiles on my babe! [Frustrated noise] [Whispering to Neptr] Quickly! While he's distracted! No, c'mon, get out of the—UGH! Move! Wenk! Baaaugh! [Penguin waddles forward] This game cheats anyway! [Drops console, accidentally smashing it] LOOK WHAT YOU DID, GUNTER!! We're home free, Neptr. Wenk wenk wenk wenk wenk wenk wenk! What are you on about? You're starting to infuriate me... It's almost like you're trying to alert me—warn me about... I don't know, an intruder or something? Perhaps he's lurking in this very room, just outside my field of vision! Wenk wenk wenk wenk. Well, knock it off!! What'll we do, creator? We're gonna prank 'im, Neptr. Hardcore. [Looking at reflection] Hmm. You're looking kinda fat, Gunter! Look at these arms! Fat fat fat! Daddy's little fattie! Oh, you'll never get a prom date with all that chub on your face, you know! [An ice spike lands on Hee hee hee hee! Creator, you have shown me the joys of pranking! I cannot wait to throw pies infinitely at Jake's face! The ceiling really is melty! [Falls] Whoa! Whoa! [Slides away with Neptr] What was that? WAAAAH! Alarm! Alarm! Alarm! Figs! Huh? An intruder! Maybe a beautiful princess like in my poems. We've gotta find that lightning as fast as— Creator! Lightning! It's a lightning-shaped door! And we're gonna smash right into it! Hold on, Neptr! I got a plan! That was a great plan! Nah, that wasn't my plan. We got lucky! Are those my tickets to the gun show, creator? Mm-hmm. You're gonna be fully functional just like I promised. Whoa, ice-o-pede! Finn?! Oh, why can't you ever be a princess?! Ice-o-pede, attack! [Ice-o-pede bites Let's grab some lightning and get outta here! Hahaha! Finish him off, my semi-loyal pet! [The ice-o-pede fires at Finn and makes him drop Neptr.] An innocent bystander?! ZAP! Neptr! NOOOOO! [The ice magic reaches Neptr] NOOOOOO!—Oh, yeah. That's what we wanted to happen.  Neptr! Yeah! Crush him! Crush him like you crushed me!! Creator? Neptr! The pies! Pies! Oh, right! Come on! What was in those pies?! Just boysenberry. Hahaha. And also... poison. [Thinking] Neptr's acting... different. Quick, Finn! Jump! Heh heh. You guys got me. [To himself as the duo escapes] Something about that robot I tried to kill fills me with... deep longing. Thanks, guys. Your blood-oath is fulfilled. Yay! To the mesosphere! Finally we can die! I am troubled, creator. Troubled by a sudden urge to... collect princesses. Neptr, that's a heavy unsettling thing to say, but pull yourself together. We're about to prank Jake! [Sad] Uh-huh. Sure. One... two... [Opening door] THREE! Run, Neptr!! Oooh! [Charging at Ice King] Hah! Hah! Hah! [Ice King freezes I've come to take my son. Your son?! Come to Papi, son. I won't attack you... unless provoked. He's not your son! If anything, he's my son! It was my power that activated his full potential. Zzz. [Makes a small lightening bolt] Oooh... When you were struck by my lightening, you also became infused with my private particles. He wants to be with me, Finn! No way! Neptr wants to help me prank Jake! I am torn! I am processing a love for both princesses and pranking! Don't worry, son. I'll show you the life you deserve! [Spins very quickly] No! Neptr! Yes! Now that we've entered my imagination zone, allow me to tantalize you with this! [Snaps; princesses appear.] Princesses! As my son, you will carry on the tradition of capturing ladies! Tell me more, Papi! No, Neptr! I want a son who can do better than I. One who can succeed where I... have failed. You can mate with robot princesses! Can I still prank with Finn after? NO!! I'll show you what will happen if you hang out with Finn! Yeah! Pootin' on Neptr to the max! Haha! Yeah, I love Finn's pranks! NOOOOO!! [The three exit the Imagination Zone.] I'm through playing around, son. Who do you choose? Come on, Neptr. Choose me, buddy. Choose pranks. I... uh, I... choose... Ice King! WHAT?! You've gotta be flippin' kidding me! He made his choice! Get over it, crybaby! I'm not finished. I choose Ice King... to prank! Hardcore! [Angry] WHHHAAAAT— [Neptr launches a pie at NEVER! OOF! [Gets knocked out by Finn] Sleep well, Papi. In your Imagination Zone full of beautiful princesses. You wanna prank Jake? It's why I was created. Haha, okay. Let's gooooo! [ [Tired] Ahhh, hey, du—AAAAAH! Sun is going down. Shall we capture princesses now, Papi? No, let's just stay here a little longer, son. I love you forever, Papi. Jake? BMO? Hey, man, what you doing?! [Startled] Dude! Don't worry, bro. We won't tell anyone about the private time you spend with your wad of Princess Bubblegum's hair. [Blushing] You guys knew? Finn, we're roommates. Which is why I'm gonna share my beloved keepsake with you. Babadadaa! My old baby blanket. Hmmm! Hmmhmmhmmhmm! Who are you? Hmm hmm hmm hmm! Hmmhmmhmm. Noooo! Hmmhmm! Come on! I'll get your kid back, toy! Hmmhmmph! That guy must do crazy squats. Get back here, you thieving Door Lord! You butt! Come on, Bubblegum! Finn? Marceline! Are you okay?! Yeah. Don't worry. We'll get him. No! [Sighs] What? [Letters start to light up around the gate's frame] "This door shall yield to no command save for a song from a genuine band." What is this gripagrap?![citation needed] It's the door of the Door Lord, Finn. We used to lock them up, but they kept breaking out. 'Cause they're Door Lords. [Wearing a sunhat and gloves] They broke out because you let them live. [Angered grunt] Hmm? The door said it will open for genuine band. Let's try and music this door open as a quintet. Can I be the jerk it the band? 'Cause that's an important part of a band's success. [Shrinks face] Hmph. I know how to get through this door. We're gonna lay down a chill jam. Hey. Yeah, yeah, yeah! Just keep it cool. Got that princess? Hmph. [Grabs BMO] Let's see if you hacks can keep up with my raw talent! It's working! Look at the door! ...To bury you in the ground... and drink the blood from your... Ugh! [At Princess Bubblegum] Stop staring at me! Ugh, you threw me off! Come on, everybody! Don't stop now. The door was responding to our music! I wonder what it liked or what was missing. Well, I know what's missing. Talent. I'm getting out of here, you hacks! Talentless hacks! [Leaves] Yikes. [Takes off his backpack] Maybe to be a genuine band we need to be nicer to each other and hang out as buds. [Pulls out a noodle cake] Let's take a noodle break. Come on, it will help! No! Wait, don't go, too! I'm just gonna get stuff to cook that. Cook? That was sweet what you said about being buds. Mm-hmm. Thanks. [Returning with a hot plate] I'm back yo! Come here, baby. [BMO comes and Oh. For our next attempt, I wanna be the lead. Yeah! Sounds cool, my bud. Hmph! Jake, you're back! Shut yo' face. I came back for the music. BMO, execute Sound Structure Alpha. [BMO begins to play a song] Marceline, begin playing triplet quavers in mixolydian mode. Alright, fine. [Begins to play her Ax bass] Wait, what's a quaver? Now, Finn, vibrate your uvula by dampening and undampening your larynx. Wha? [Rubbing her neck, vibrating her voice] Go like this, silly. Oh. [Does it] Whaaaa... Okay, okay. Jake, are you gonna join in? Everyone, just stick to my blueprints. [Gasps] [BMO catches fire] Oohh... [Sighs] One more time? I may have, um... miscalculated. Ha! Looks like you aren't as perfect as you thought. Guess you can't judge me anymore. I never said you had to be perfect! Alright, time out, guys. Princess! Princess, wait! [Hisses] Whatever, [Eyes start to water] Ugh! I'm outta here, too! [Leaves] Marceline? [Cries] You've all forgotten 'bout the music! I quit the band! [Runs away backwards] I'm just pretending! Jake! Everybody! We can beat the Door Lord! ...Together. [Spits out sandwich] Hmm? Hmmhmmhmm! It's over, Door Lord. So hand over our stuff. Hmmhmmhmmhmm. Hmmhmmhmm hmmhmmhmmhmm hmmhmm hmmhmmhmmhmm. Hmm! What's he trying to say? I totally get it. He may have stolen our treasures... ...But by doing so, he showed us... ...That the real treasure is friendship. [Happy] Mmmhmmhmm! Mmmhmm hmmhmmhmm. Hmm... Okay, here's that lock of Bubblegum's hair you love so much. Oh, you. [Sighs] Ah, yeesh. And here's [Happily twirls it] Yippie ki-yi-yay! Marceline, here's your rock shirt. Hey, that's not... [Rushes towards it] It's mine! That's mine. You... kept the shirt I gave you? Yeah. It, uh, means a lot to me. But you never wore it. [Puts it on] Dude, I wear it all the time... as pajamas. Wait, if that's Bubblegum's shirt, what are you missing, Marceline? Wait a second, wait a second! You don't have a thing! You just wanted to hang out with us! No, I didn't! No way, you're caught! I figured you out! [Laughs] [Playfully] I'll kill you! [Looks up and stops playing] Are you okay, dude? Yeah, why? You look bored. Naw, that's just how I look when I'm listening to music. Well good, because I'm about to kick it up a notch. Bring it! [walks to the door, and hops on Jake] Who do you think it is? Could be anybody. [stretches so that Finn can look out the window] Hmm... I can't quite make it out. [Ice King turns his head] Eee! Ahh! It's the Ice King! The Ice King?! Think this is the right address, [takes note out of his beard] mmm is this, is this.... [bursting out door with a sword and kicks the Ice King down] Eiiiiaah! Yeah! Kick his butt, dude! Eat my sword, Ice King! [throws his sword in the air and then throws it at the Ice King who uses his ice as a shield] Aww. You can not defeat me, child! I will, though! With a sweet kick! [throws himself in the air with his foot forward, but punches Ice king in the face at the last second] Psych! [The Ice King snuffs him with his beard and freezes his head then flings him on the ground.] Whoo, hoo hoo! What's the good news? I'm getting married... to someone who wants to marry me! My betrothed is right over there! [waves to show them the Old Lady Princess, who is in a cart with some penguins] Hi, honey! Hey, cool guy. I'm a lucky guy—I didn't even have to kidnap this one! She fell in love with me the moment I slipped on her engagement ring! [wiggles his fingers in front of Finn and Jake] Eww. [the penguins wheel her away] Bye-bye! The lady penguins are throwing her one of those "bachelorette" parties. [To Finn] This is weird, dude. Hmm... if you get married, what about capturing princesses? Oh well, no more capturing pretty princesses for this Ohhh... [walking away] well, fare thee well, Ice King! Hmm? Yeah, good luck with ye and thy creepy wedding. We totally support your decision to stop capturing princesses! [closes door to Tree Fort, turns to Jake] I'm happy for him. [He hears knock at the door, he opens it to see Ice King is still there.] [laughs nervously] Sure wish someone would throw me a bachelorette party—oop, I mean, "man-lorette" party. But we hate you. If you won't throw me man-lorette party, then I'll never have my last hurrah before buckling down with that battle axe! It'll drive me back to a life of stealing hot princesses! Is that what you want?! No. No, no, no, no, no. [to Jake] Dude, we gotta show him a good time and treat him right. Otherwise, he'll go back to imprisoning ladies! I-I can't have that! I— [puts his finger over Finn's mouth] Shhh, I know. I know that you can't have that. Don't worry. [turns to Ice King] Alright, let's go party, Ice King. [giggles] [now in the Grass Lands] Best man-lorette party ever! [laughs and conjures a snowball] [laughs] [laughs] [laughs] Fah! [throws snowball at the ground, killing it] Hahahaha! Now I'm gonna go get married! Hehehehe! ♫I'm gonna get married!♪ [walking toward Tree Fort] Bye, Ice King! Good luck! Have fun being married! No more stealing princesses! Yeah--wait. No more s-stealing princesses? Wow. [running back to him] What?! I didn't realize I'd have to give up stealing the ladies. But you said you were fine with it! I know what I said, but, y'know, sometimes you say things and then you don't really mean them. What? Are you serious?! I'm just not sure I wanna get married in such a hurry. What if she's just after my [pulls back his beard] Demonic Wishing Eye and Ghost pouch? [laughs maniacally] We just took you out partying so that you could feel better about getting hitched! Maybe I'll just go back to capturing lots of girls. It's what I feel comfortable doing, y'know? Being free, wind at my back, lots of girls, kidnapping 'em. [starting towards Ice King] Alright, here comes my double kick! [holding him back] Finn, Finn, cool yourself, buddy. We need to get this guy married, remember? Yeah, I remember. Watch. [walking to Ice King] Let big brother handle this. [poking Ice King] Hey, Ice King? Don't be nervous. Marriage is the most beautiful thing that could ever happen to a jerk like you. Really? Why? [starts sweating] "Why?" [walks back to Finn] Poots, that guy is good. Why? Why? Jake— Not now! [to himself] Why, why, why, why, why? My mind is made up—80% sure. No marriage. Well, uh... don't you wanna grow old with somebody? Right? [pointing] Just like these old swans. Bleh, those stinky old swans. Huh? What?! Ohhhh, now I get what you guys are trying to tell me! Marriage is a thing that allows me to capture a princess forever and let her live inside of me! [crying] Marriage is the most beautiful thing in the world! Uhh... Yeah—I-I never—uhh... I guess it is. [to Jake] Jake, this is bad news, man! We gotta go tell him that he can't eat his wife! Eh, let's cross that bridge when we get to it. Look how happy he is. The wedding? Back on—100%! [laughs and skips away] [wipes sweat from brow] Phew! All that's left is the lousy wedding. [fist bumps Finn] I'm weddy for the wedding! Y'know, even though the Ice King is a wad, I'm pretty happy for him. Uh-huh. This wedding looks lame, man. [Ice King is seen on a snow pyramid with some penguins and Snowman Priest] Be prepared to be bored outta your mind. [laughs] Finn, Jake, you made it! [ Weird—and your bride is into that? This is a traditional wedding ritual for good luck in the Well... [shrugs] cool, man. I'm glad y'all are happy... being crazy together. Thank you! Excuse me as we finish preparing for the nuptials. 2, 4, 8, 16, 20, uh— 32. Yes—32, 64, one hundred and—eh. Huh? Her eyes are huge! I'm gonna go check 'em out. [sees Jake scratching his ear] And stop scratching your ear, man—it's gross. It wasn't me—it was my foot, dude. [walks up to princess] Whoa, you've got ridiculously large eyes, princess! Are you allergic to somethin'? [tearing up] No, Finn. I was just born like this. Why are you crying? I'm not crying, Finn—my tear sac is broken! Help me! What?! I didn't say anything. The Ice King cursed me! You've gotta set me free. I would rather die than marry the Ice King! [gasp] He tricked me! And I was happy for that son of a toot! [points] Look at her ring. She fell in love with me the moment I slipped on her engagement ring. That's what cursed her! Don't worry, princess. I'll remove this ring and save your life. [tries to pull off ring] No! She's my love boat! [zaps at them with ice magic but misses] No, man. You cursed her. She hates you! Okay, that's your opinion! [gets ready to zap again] Wait a minute! [sighs] So you knew she was cursed all along, which means you knew she wasn't trying to steal your Demonic Eye Junk or whatever, and you knew you had total control of her! Yeah, yes, that's right. So then why did you make us go through all that junk about why marriage is worth stuff?! Oh, I don't know... I'm complicated—and spontaneous! [laughs] That's probably why she wants to marry me! She wants to marry you because you brainwashed her! Silence! [shoots ice at them] Whoa, wait! [the ice freezes their feet] Aw, man! It's time for the lowering ceremony! Hoist her up! Hehehehe! Commence the lowering! Yes, nothing can stop me now. Hyah! [punches Ice King, and they both fall off the pyramid] What is wrong with you, man?! [grabs Ice King's nose] Strangling the groom's nose at a wedding? [kicks Finn back up the pyramid] What's wrong with you?! You're the one that there's something wrong with! Gotcha! Thanks, man Hehe, no problem. [getting up] Ehh. [walking up to him] I think you dropped something. [tosses a penguin at him] Catch! [freezes the penguin in midair] Huh? [catches the penguin and sinks into the snow a couple feet] Whoa! [bolt freezes him] Jake! [eyes now normal-sized] Huh, what? JAKE! [tries to lift the penguin] Grrrr. [Jake slides down next to him] Oh, hey. Hey. You got the ring off her finger? Huh? Oh. Oh yeah. Now she's not hypnotized, but we're still frozen. I got a plan. Oh, good. Now, let's try that again. [to penguins] Lower her! [struggling with rope as she gets lowered] You lousy, butt-faced pig! I hate you! Here she comes. Yes, touch my beard, deary. Yes, that's right. Almost there... Now! [strains] Oh! I'm married, right, snowman? Yes, it's official. It's official! You done married a dog, dude! What? What's that supposed to— [sees that the finger that touched his beard is actually Jake's] Oh no. [laugh] Wait, what the—? What am I laughin' about? [sighs] And now everything's back to normal. Well, I wouldn't say everything. [pounding on the door] Come on, guys. Help me celebrate my un-marriage. [laugh]  Squish. Photosynthesize! Photosynthesize! Photo- You grabbing a snack, Fern? Yeah. Water and light combine so I can make my own food. In case I don't catch anything. Come on, man, don't be so dow- [Gasps] Hey, I got something! Hey, I got something too! Nice. Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Pretty weird fish, huh? That's me - the dude who dinks it up, just like I dinked it up when you left Ooo. I was supposed to protect it. Instead, it went all crazy. I didn't even help. I just covered myself in root beer and danced around like a dummy. I can't do anything right! Hey, stop it. You need a squoze? Yes. I feel better. Sometimes being a good dude ain't about not dinking it. Learn from your dinks. Like, you know my first battle with a giant? I never told anybody this, but- You boom-boomed in your shorts. I know. I have your memories. Yeah, I boom-boomed. The point is I learned from it, and now I'm [Together] What's that sound? Oh, I bet it's a monster. Let's fight this dude Fern's way. [Drawing his sword] Yeah. [Together] Sweet P? [They both grab his leg as he passes.] Whoa! Okay, Fern, what do you think we should do next? Mm, sever his tendons? [Draws his sword again.] [Winces] Before you say no, it would stop him from running. We're gonna handle this librarian style. [ [Quietly] Library style. Squo-o-oze. Mm. Great thinking, Fern. I just copied you. Is that thinking? [Talking to Sweet P] What up, buttercup? Why you run, pork bun? The monster! Was it LSP? [Shakes his head] The monster that whispers me bad thoughts. [Narrating] Mommy and Daddy came to save me, but they said I was imagining things, which was true. [Narrating] But last night, I really did see it. And I've been running and running since then. Aww, Sweet P. It sounds like you might just be having bad dreams. No, I only have one dream anymore. Uhh... Uhh... But the whisper monster is even scarier, saying stuff like, " Oh, you're not bad. You're super good. Now, let's get you home. But it's getting late, and bogs are super dangerous to travel in at night. Your body will be preserved for thousands of years. No one will ever find you. [Wailing] Fern! Okay, okay, we'll see you in the morning, Tree Trunks. [He hangs up.] All right, bedtime, Sweet P. You want me to knock him out? Er, not this time. How about a bedtime story? Yes, please. Once there was a kingdom of spaghetti. Mmm. [Whispering in his sleep.] Punch, punch. Kiss, kiss. Listen to your bones. [Whispering] Fern. [Whispering] Fern! Hey. What's up? [Whispering] I heard something. Can you see what it is with your tree senses? I don't have those. Uh, can I help you? Oh, sorry. We heard you scuttling around and thought- What? You didn't hear me "scuttling around." Foxes are silent hunters. I mean, geez, do you know how rude that is? Ugh. Gonna be brooding about this all week. Sorry, man. Look. Aah! Get off him! Huh? I got him! Oh, no. I know where I've seen that thing before. Huh? [Laughs evilly and jumps through a window] Finn, Jake! What's shaking? You will not believe what just happened. It must've been the day that BMO found that little sailor hat. Hold him down, Fern! That hand is the flippin' Lich! I know. [Chuckles evilly] Yes, child. I have returned once more to- Bah! Bah! Bah! Bah! Evil! You're gonna get it for messing with our boy Sweet P. That vessel may appear harmless, but he came from me. Once I remind him of his legacy, The Lich shall reign once more. Isn't that right, son? Aah! Finn! Ugh! I dinked it again! Why did Mr. Hand call me "son"? Was that my monster daddy? Okay, delegate, delegate - Fern, stay here and guard Sweet P. I'm gonna try and catch up. Don't trust me to guard anything. I'm a total scrub-up. [Quietly] Dude, there's already one Lich loose in Ooo. If Sweet P turns E-V-I-L tonight, there might be a second. I need you here. [He draws his sword and departs in pursuit of the Lich.] You got this! [To himself] You got this. Quickly, while the boy is gone, we must seek out my Well of Power. [Normal voice] No! Am I turning into a monster? That's the working theory. [From the phone] I can't come to the phone right now. I'm either hanging with Finn, my kids, my GF, or I'm dead. Bye! [Tone] Hey man, hit me when you get this. [He hangs up and tuts.] Dude's missing a Lich fight. [He arrives at the subway entrance.] Okay, Lich. Get ready to die. Again. For, like, the fifth time! Oh, hey, it's this awful place. Oh, you're tricky, huh? I can hear you down there! Speak up, man. What? [Chuckles evilly] You've bested me in many worlds, child, but I always return. You're so evil it's boring. You're basic, man. Yes. While a mortal world doubts and questions, I know exactly what I am. I am the ceaseless wheel. The last scholar of GOLB. I am your doom. Skull man! Huh? I, too, am doom. Hey, what's going on up there? [Laughs evilly] Child, you have failed. The vessel has turned. We reign now as twin kings of ruin. Sweet P... I'm not a king of ruin. What? I am sweet. You're just a naughty hand. Beast, obey me! Obey- No! Eesh. Hooray! You're a natural! But where's Fern? He wouldn't let me follow you, so I knocked him out cold. Yeah, I met my bio-dad once too. He wasn't evil incarnate, but he was kind of a crummy dude. TT and Mr. P love you. That's all that matters. Fern! Sweet P saved me and slew The Lich! [Exasperated] That's great. [On voicemail] You're just a naughty hand. [On voicemail] Beast, obey me! Obey- No! End of message. To repeat this message, press 7. To save... Wha...? [Thinking to himself] I don't get it. Why isn't it working out being myself? Finn's off having fun defeating losers. I can't even guard a baby. [Thinking to himself] It doesn't matter how hard I try. I'll always just be in the shadow of the real Finn. Unless I could become... [Out loud] the only Finn. Uh, yeah, but that's a weird thing to call me. What'cha think? I can make that driz, no problem. It's crazy far, man. Naw, that's just a perspectal illusion. It looks far 'cause the cliff's lower. Eh, go for it. Whoo! Shoot! Almost. Not really. What? Watch me, fool! [jumps again] Hup. WAAAAAAH! I did it! Psych. [smacks lips] Hey, you know what? This is cool, just having bro time for once. What, like, no ladies? Or dudes, or whatevs. It's just a chore sometimes. Yeah, two people is mad efficient. Whoa. It's a beach brawl! Looks like they're trying to drown a barn. That's not a barn. That's a dude! Holy fizzle! [to a Marauder] What's goin' on here, tough boy? [sits on the Marauder's arm] What is that huge dude? He's the Farm, the legendary fighter of the Shiney Isles. I came here to participate in his open challenge, but this mother can't be beat! Give up, worms! My fight power is supreme! [punches water] I'm too freaking legendary for you! [drops Farm animals and punches a Marauder.] [chanting] Train, Train, Train, Train! Whoa! I love you, the Train! You're almost as legendary as the Farm, the Train!  Oh, my Glob. [now under the Farm] Choooo! Ow. My legs are backwards! Oh! [the Train kicks him ashore] Oh, you're mean! [farts] Did you just die? No... the Train will chug on. My friend makes bionic legs. I'll be better than before. [gasps] I want bionic legs! Who's your friend? Yeah, right. It's secret! [begins dragging himself away] Ah! Don't follow me. [continues] Oh! You don't want bionic legs. It ain't natchy. I don't care about natchy. Let's discuss this later. You guys wanna fight me? [to Jake] You think we can beat him? Yeah way, we can't! He's the ultimate! But if we beat him, we'll be crazy legends. Man, I already am a legend in other aspects of life. Third highest score in Kompy's Kastle, bro. [holds up three fingers] Third... in the Candy Kingdom. Jake, that's your legend. This could be our legend. Brogend! Okay. How are we gonna beat him, then? Train! He can't even walk. No, man, train up, like, get ripped! Yeah, I was just kiddin'. Let's destroy that guy! [points to the Farm] We're comin' back for you, the Farm! After we train! [coughs] Yeah, that's cool. We're gonna annihilate you, the Farm! Mm'kay. I'm gonna do a finishing move on you! Alright! Yeah! [laughs] [runs off] C'mon, Jake! [follows Finn] Whoof. [coughs] Hyah! Hyah! Let's see your Chokey Brokey Style! [strangled] Nice one. Yes! Now watch my... Something Style. [closes his eyes and punches Finn] Huh? Jake, you're playing Kompy's Kastle? Huh? Whoo! Uh... yes. Winning this battle could take our reputation to a whole new level! Look, I'm a full-grown dog of my own, and I need to play Kompy's Kastle every day so I can maintain my rank. So, you don't care about fighting the Farm? I never really take anything seriously... 'cept Kompy's Kastle. Hi-yah! [karate chops Jake's game out of his hands] KOMPYYYYY! I'm gonna break every bone in your body, then heal you later with that magical goo we got from the Cyclops' eye! [grows huge fists] AAAH! [smashes Finn] Ouch. [now giant-sized] [picks up Finn] Apologize! [trying to escape Jake's grip] Never! [punches and grabs Jake's finger flesh] I'm gonna turn up the juice! [shaped Jake's flesh to look like Jake's face] And I'm gonna drink it! [punches the face] [gasps] My little face! Ouch! [punches his head where Finn is, but Finn climbs onto his nose] Ow. [punches his nose, but Finn jumps off] Oh! [starts spanking himself] Where are ya? Huh? [laughs] Huh? [sees Finn] Apologize for not taking training seriously! Come out, you chicken nug! [stretches into tree] [turns around and punches Jake] Huh! Ow. [groans] Apologize to Kompy's Kastle! [weakly] No. You apologize for not taking training seriously. Ehh, gross! [laughs] [groans] Ow! [pushes Finn down and slaps his head] AAH! My eyes! [wiping mud away] Cheap move, you butt rag! You! You're the cheap move! Huh? Pants! [kicks Jake away] Huh! Oh! I'm really gonna wipe you now. [growing his buttocks] Bring it on, bro! [squishes Finn underneath his buttocks] [chomps] OUCH! Ow! O-o-o-ow! No bities! [stretches to normal size] Grrrrr! [barks] [pulling up his pants while walking away] I'm gonna down the Farm without you. I'm gonna knock down the Farm just so you'll never know the taste of downing the Farm! Yo, guess what? Guess what, homey? I put in the time. I'ma make you mine. Yeah, that's right. Come and get this. [yawns] [smacks lips] So, what? Both at the same time? I'm cool. You gonna fight this, the Farm? [laughs] Okay. Just me. I don't need this [points to Jake] clown-town. The only way you're gonna win is if you use your cheap moves. [yawns, falls asleep, and starts snoring] Hey. [touching Finn's hair] Come on! You gotta fight the dude! Ah! I can't see! Walk me to the light! Yeah, that's what you get. [sleepily] Cloud looks like a car. [closes eyes] Awaken to your dream, Finn and Jake. Whoa. Who are you? I am the Are you gonna show us a move to beat the Farm? First, listen. Then, wake up. Alright. I have cheap cars. My cars are che-e-eap. [trance-like, with closed eyes] My cars are cheap. But they drive bad when I turn out the lights! [punches a headlight] Turn out the lights. [now wearing green pants] These sweatpants have another name. Another name. Yeah. Don't you always call sweatpants "give-up-on-life pants," Jake? I do, because peeps need to respect themselves when they leave the house... even if it's just for ice cream, or TP, or whatev. [holding two gold apples] Two shiny golden apples, ripe enough to bite. Bite. [bites the apples] That's all I gotta say for now. Get lost. What is going on here, Dream Warrior? Yeah, what's this all about? [sprays a hose at them] Nap's over, sorry. Ow! Whoa. That... was a good nap. Hey, did you dream about Dream Warrior? Yeah. What was he trying to tell us, exactly? I don't know; I didn't get it. But listen, man. I'm sorry I got mad at you. Who cares about my high score at Kompy? It ain't important. No, man. It is important. Being the third best at something is math and deserves respect. Not like I did to Kompy. Anyway, I think we both got cranky after all that training. Well, good thing we're rested, 'cause now we can beat this beast. Yeah. Oh, hey! Look! Dudes came back to watch us fight! A'ight. This is it. Let's use what we learned in training. Uh, all we did was fight dirty with cheap—wait. My cars are che-e—che-e-eap Dream Warrior was telling us what cheap moves to use on the Farm! Headlights mean eyes! Mud in the eyes! Give-up-on-life pants! [pants down] Pull down his pants like you did to moi! Two golden apples! Hm. I think I know what that means. Well, sure. I can make a wild guess. You ready, man? Yeah, dude! [whispering] Put your pants on. [deep voice] Okay. [cheering] Hey, Jake. Yeah? You ever wonder what a demon's heart looks like? Of course, dude. You ever wonder what a demon's heart tastes like? Hey, kid... You want some magic powers...? Magic powers for absolutely free... Heck yeah! [To Finn] Wait! Let's not be too rash! Just look at this guy! [The reaper chuckles menacingly.] Check out the sunken, lifeless eyes... The foul stench of decay... You know what that means? Means he's evil, I guess. Well, evil, sure... but mostly, he's unattractive, and unattractive people are desperate. You should haggle with him! [To Reaper] Hey! I want more than just free powers! What else ya got?! Alright... Free magical powers and... [Pulling left arm off] Eh! And this keychain. [Jumping excitedly] OH! OH! OH! [Whispering] Play it cool, Finn. Right. [To Reaper, faking] I begrudgingly accept your offer. [Menacingly] Yes... Then the deal is struck! [Lightning flashes] WAHAHAHAHAHA! [Storm clouds abruptly go away.] You can pick up your powers right through that door. [A mystical, dangerous-looking portal suddenly appears next to him.] [Holding up a sign that says "FREE MAGICK"] This way... This place looks magical. You think this is where we get the powers? Yes, I do. [Emerging from door] Free powers for all. Want some? Yeah! Are you the guy handing 'em out? You seek Bufo, the wizard! So, where's that guy? [Indicating his person] He is here, of course. Uh... He's here... but he's not you. That's right. [Making his fist bigger] We should beat 'im up until he starts makin' sense! [All speaking simultaneously] We are Ohhhh... [One tadpole is lagging behind this time] So... you wish to be inducted into the ancient order of—[Only one tadpole speaking] Dang it, Leonard!! If we don't talk at the same time, nobody can understand us! Sorry... geez... [All speaking simultaneously] Ahem... So... You want free wizard powers... Powers like... [Creating mystical energy blasts from the host's hands] these! [Excitedly] Hahaha! Yeah! We want 'em! Give us the stuff! Oh, boy! Yes, we do! Can't wait! [Slowly retreating to the building] [Mysteriously] Then follow.... Whoo-hoo! Whoo! Behold the Grand Hall of Wizardry! [Camera pans to show wizard students training.] This is where young potentials train to become Ultimate Wizards! Most are not ready for the responsibility that comes with it. [Cheerfully] I'm responsible, dude! Yeah! So am I! [Still cheerfully] That's a lie! It is a lie... and I take full responsibility for it! Yes, yes... very responsible. Now I bestow upon you these wizard cloaks! Whoa! Hey! This is a dress! Yeah! And I am into it! It's, like, gossamer! [He stuffs the bottom of the cloak into his shorts and unhoods.] This way I won't be embarrassed! Fine, fine. Now for every power that you accrue, [Creating star badges on cloak] you shall receive a star badge like these. [Pointing to big star on cloak] This final star betokens the rank of Ultimate Wizard! Mark me, Jake. I shall have that final star! [To Bufo] Where do we start?! Level 1—Dustomancy. Yeah! Dustomancy! Whatever that is! Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme! To receive this power, you must first... [Making two brooms appear] eat these brooms. Alright. [He and Jake begin.] Ah, wait! [Spits out splinters and sticks tongue out, showing splinters on tongue] This is gross!! Man, I can't eat this! Yeah, you can! Do what I do! RAAAAWR!! [Increases size then eats broom with ease. He shrinks back to his normal size, but the broom remains the same size.] Oops. [Slightly increases size] Ah, there we go. Whoooaaa! You got a star! Haha! Observe my magics! Wait, Jake! Don't use 'em until I finish my broom! [Gnaws furiously on broom. Scene transition; [Rising up] Dude, you got your star, too! [Rising up] WE'RE DUSTOMANCERS! [Strains trying to use powers] Nothing happened! This is a total ripoff!! Bufo! You tricked us! Stupid power doesn't even work!! Calm yourself, boy. [Strikes Finn] You are acting hysterical. Do you not see that you are using Dustomancy? Behold... I'm doing this? So... I have— Yes. Mastery over all dust motes. You can also read their emotions. For instance, this mote is very unhappy in his marriage. Well, that's... sorta cool. "Sorta" cool?!? THIS IS RADICAL! Whoo, yeah! Force that enthusiasm! Are you ready for more magic? We get more?! So much more... like Level 2... the power of... Shadowcery! [Makes blindfolds appear over Finn and Jake's eyes] You can't see through those, right? Nope... Not at all. To gain provenance over the shadows, place your hands into [Making bowl of peeled grapes appear] this bowl! [Slightly removing blindfold] What bowl? No! Cover your eyes! [Annoyed] Mmmm, fine... Thrust your hands into this bowl... of eyeballs. Eyeballs?! Dude, it's okay. They're just peeled grapes. No! They're eyeballs... [Giggles mischievously. Finn and Jake feel the grapes and make disgusted noises.] Well done. You have groped the eyeballs fearlessly. Another star! Yeah! Shadowcery... [He morphs his shadow into a three-dimensional form of a horse. The horse neighs.] Onward, my shadow steed! [Tries to jump on horse but phases through it] Huh? No touchies. [Disappears] Wizard powers are so cool... I want ALL THE STAR BADGES!!! Excellent. Well done. All we're missing now is the big star! You ready to complete the set, man? Nah, I'm good. [In disbelief] WHAT?! How can you stop now?? Eh... I've got everything I need. A limitless supply of mayonnaise, this captivating new hairstyle... and I just learned the best spell of all! What's that? Sleep. Aw... What a lame-o. [Walking up to Bufo] Bufo! I'm ready to get that big star! To tell true, the last power is not free. Wha?? You can't do this to me, man! I've got no money! No, no cash. For the final star, you must take the pledge of ultimate responsibility. [Nonchalantly] Okay. I'll take that pledge. Are you sure? Perhaps you are not sufficiently familiar with— I'm ready! Well, there may be ramifications that you cannot— [Impatiently] Just let me take that pledge, man! My word, I've never met someone so irresponsibly responsible. Very well, then. You must... grasp my hand. That's it? [Does it] Easy! [He shines with a glorious light and screams. A big star glows on his cloak. Direct your attention to the scale-model orb. Huh? [Looks at viewing globe] Is that an asteroid heading for this very temple? Yes. It's been heading for this temple for 847 years. Only the magic of the ultimate wizards keeps it from getting any closer. Quickly, add your power to that of the orb. Oh, okay. [Does it; the force of the blast pushes Now I release the elder Jeremy from his pledge. Razzamafoo! It's about time... [Gets teleported out of his station into the host's hand] And you take his place... for the rest of your natural life. This is what you signed up for when you took the pledge of ultimate responsibility. This is what all the wizard training was about?! [Stops supplying power to the orb] You tricked me! Young wizard! The asteroid approaches! Oh, yeah. Sorry. [Supplies orb with power; the asteroid recedes.] I tricked you, of course... but would anyone really volunteer to do this? [Leaving] I'm out. [Shuts door] Aw, man, this sucks. [Frustrated noise] Old people! There's gotta be a better way! Nope... This is how the ancient ones wanted it. Yeah? I've got a younger idea! [Removes himself from station] You fool! Your newfangled thinking will get us all killed! Youth culture forever! [Runs outside; spots the asteroid.] Whoa. Hey! Have you gone crazy?! Get back in the bouncy harness! Sleep! [Fires spell] You are—! Uhh... [Falls asleep] Ultimate Wizardry, activate! [Nothing happens] ...Uh... Hm. Maybe my footing's off? [Adjusts footing; his fist begins glowing] There you go! [ [Still sleeping] Reflect. [Reflects spell.] Hey, I'm alive! What's that up there? [Noticing asteroid] AH! OH, NO! Hah... My stupid young idea will be responsible for hundreds of deaths! [Unsympathetically] It sure will! Huh? Old wizards! You ditched your responsibilities to help me! What? No! We left so we wouldn't be killed by that asteroid! [Slightly annoyed] Oh, okay, um, since you're here already, could you lend me a hand?? Huh?? Whoo-hoo! Nice job! Thanks to us, the village is saved. And we reclaimed a few of your twilight years! Don't forget to thank me. For this was my plan for all of these 847 years. No way! Your plan was to dupe a succession of rubes into keeping the asteroid at bay! [Guilty] Perhaps you're right. No more giving out free powers. I hereby renounce all magic. [ Chill, man. You don't have to quit your job. I don't? Nah. Just don't take credit for ideas that aren't yours. Oh... okay... [Finn and Jake start leaving.] Good idea... [To himself] Glad I thought of it... Hey, naked kid. you want some free... Demon heart?! Aw, ha ha ha haw, yeah! Full circle!! Jake. [Whispering] Wizard Battle is starting soon! [Pushes Finn away, groans] I know! We got here six hours early, you dork! Just wake me up when they start selling hot dogs. [sees that he is laying on a hot dog] Whoa! What do you know! [Eee gasp] The wizards are arriving! Whoo-hoo! Yeah!!! [Offscreen] Ladies and gentlemen... [Gasps repeatedly] I am the [Looking through binoculars] Whoo, wizard only allowed! Whoo. Whoo. Wh-...[Sees Ice King] Oh, what? Ice King! Boo! You're a contestant?! Mm-hmm. You guys come here to watch me win? Phshoo, you're gonna lose, man. You're a loser. Ha! I'm not gonna lose! I've got a foolproof plan for winning. [Whispers] I'm gonna cheat. [Laughs] And now L's and G's, witness the unveiling of this tournaments grand prize, [A curtain rises over the blimps cockpit revealing Princess Bubblegum] A kiss from Princess Bubblegum! [Princess Bubblegum starts posing with her lips as the crowds cheer] On the mouth! Boooo. Boo. Hmm. Is it an open mouth kiss? No! Then I choose to exit the battle. No one is allowed to exit Wizard Battle! [Turns the four wizards into cats; the door closes] The doors are shut. [A barrier covers the stadium. A bird flies by but gets hit by the barrier] The sky barrier is in place. All of you will kiss the princess or die in battle. Ooh, I just can't wait to taste that sweet Bubblegum. [Flies off happy] [blushing] Jake, we gotta enter the contest and stop Ice King. But we're not wizards, man. What about the sanctity and honor of Wizard Battle? I'd rather sanctify PB's lips. Ooooh! You don't care about the Ice King. You just wanna kiss Princess Bubblegum. No! I wanna save the princess! Mm-hmm. Yeah, you do. I do! Yeah, you do. Oh, shush! [Carries Jake off] Now, where's the Ice King. Over there! [Checking his breath] Oh, yeah. We need a plan, man. Okay. When the wizards start to battle, let's go hide behind that rock. By the rays of the setting sun, the battle of wizards has begun! Looks like everyone had the same plan. What are they waiting for? The opposites. Huh? The wizards with opposite powers will take each other on first. And are you a wizard? Yes. My name is Hi, Abracadaniel. My name is, uh, Magic... [Jake forms his hand into a fist] Fist. [Pops his head out of the head hole] Whoa. This kid looks like a wimp. Who's that? He's my, uh, magic second head. Well, he's right. [Sighs] I only entered this contest 'cause I thought the prize would be money. But it's just a kiss! You mean, you don't care about kissing PB? Blegh, no way. If I was the winner, I would turn my face so our lips [gasps] wouldn't touch and I would push Princess away. Turn and push, turn and push, turn and push... [To Jake] ...turn and push, turn and push. Well, I'm going back to my cave to wait for someone to kill me. Goodbye. Wait! Abracadanny, don't you worry about a thing. I'm gonna protect you. You will? Yeah, man. Also, I have an idea for how you can help me save PB's lips. Oh, okay. Yeaah! [Gasps] Cheating! He's using a weapon! Why isn't the Grand Master Wizard seeing this? Nun-chucks vanish! [The nun-chucks retract into his sleeve] Boo yah! Now's my chance to stop him. Huwahh?! Rock Wizard! Arrgghh! Come to me, meteor shower! Cantrip! Huh? [Gasp] No! [ Okay, now to stop the [Sees Abracadaniel] Ice Kiiing...? My body is squishy. That's how I survived. Whoa! That's turbo amazing! Stay close to me, Abracadaniel. What?! You turned me pink, bro! Three wizards remain. Time to get real. I wanna see some crazy wiz biz! Wiz biz! Wiz biz! Oh, I can almost taste those sweet lips. [Makes a make-out face; Abracadaniel cringes] [Whispering] Quick, listen! Now's the time for you to help me. [Whispers in Abracadaniel's ear] Hey, guys. Guys? What are you whispering? Come on! I gotta a surprise for yous fools. Yeah. That's right. Just a little closer. [Reaches into his sleeve] Ooh, what's in here? In my little sleevey hole? [Pulls out his nun-chucks] [To Abracadaniel] Watch out, man. Whoo! You got this, Danny boy! My nun-chucks! Nooo!! Yes! [Breathes hard] I did it! I really did it. I'm a true wizard. I have powers too, you butts! Yahh! Ice sword! [Creates an ice sword] Ice Shield! [Creates an ice shield]  Wha? What you say? [Nunchucks fall on his head] B'oh! [Falls unconcious] Good job, Danny. You're not a wimp anymore. You should feel pretty good. I do. I feel real good. I'm gonna forfeit now. I only wanted to stop the Ice King. [Pops out of the shirt] Uh-uh. I forfeit! I forfeit, everyone! Meow. Whoa. Abracadaniel wins! You are the greatest wizard in Ooo! Oh, w-w-well thank you, Grand Master Wizard. I guess through this trial I have become a great wizard. I, I came here with no self-esteem and no chances, a will-o-wisp of a boy, but I walk out this arena a man. A confident man! Who deserves a kiss from a princess! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! It appears you have knocked out Abracadaniel using the most shameful of all magic, a power shriek. [The crowd grumbles in discontent] But since you are the last wizard, you are the winner of Wizard Battle. [The crowd cheers] Go get ready for your kiss, champ. [Sighs] [Comes out from under the cloak] Wow, man. What? I've never heard you scream like that before. You were all like, "Nooo! No one kisses her but me!" Yeah, okay! I want to kiss her, alright? You got me! The big secret is out! Okay, Jake. I like Princess Bubblegum! ARE YOU HAPPY, JAKE?! Whoa, Jake. Don't cry, man. I'm not really mad at you. I'm just sick of having to hide my feelings all the driz. It's exhausting. Then stop hiding you feelings, man! Go out there, and smooch it up! [His tail wags] Heh heh. Yeah, alright, man. You ready in there? Yeah, I'm coming! Ooh, whoa! Oh, dag. What's going on here? Uh, Ice King was cheating his way through Wizard Battle using nun-chucks, so Jake and I faked being wizards to save you from having to kiss him and we uh, [Sighs] I dishonored Wizard Battle. Oh, Finn, ...you did all that for me? [Kisses Finn] That's for being sweet. [Slaps him] And that's for cheating. Finn, you know better than to ruin the sanctity of Wizard Battle. Wizards only, silly. Okay, everyone! Go home! Start getting ready for next year! Heh heh, oh, well. Good job. You got the kiss, man. Thanks, man. My face hurts a little. Don't worry about that, 'cause you look totally cool right now. Thanks, dude. [Puts the mask on Jake] Here, you try 'em. Okay, am I cool now? So fly. [Out of nowhere, wearing purple sunglasses] How 'bout me? Put me on the grid, scale of one to ten. One is "totally gross," ten is like, "Dang, Noooooo! Get away from me, you butchers! Starchie, you have a cold. The cure is right here. Just let me-  Oh, come on. [Sneezes] Find me a wizard! Nurse Pound Cake, hold Starchie while I administer the serum. [inhales sharply] What? Look, I'm a nurse and all, but my uncle is a magic worker and he cured my sadness about my marriage. [sighs] Listen, all magic is scientific principles presented like mystical hoo-doo, which is fun but it's sort of irresponsible. I got your magic right here, okay? And razzle dazzle! Flooby-doo! Zamabamafoo! Is that a real spell? No, I'm making fun of spells. [tears in eyes] Princess, you're being really disrespectful of my beliefs! [tears in eyes] That was very close-minded! Starchie, I just want to help. All right! You want me to go to Wizard City and get you a cold spell? You still think I'm a jerk? [Starchie nods again] All right, sit tight. How is he? He's still sick. Yo, that stinks! Tonight's part 3 of his graveyard secrets workshop. Yeah, prubs, give him the mediçon. He won't take it. He wants me to get him a cold spell from Wizard City. Oh, okay. That makes sense. [Scoffs] dude, you guys! Really? Yeah, I mean, magic's probably more natchy for your body in the long run. [sighs] Have you two been to Wizard City? Nope. "Wizards only." Wizards don't play. Trespassers get killed mad quick, like zap-zap. Well, then what? Let's stay home. Just kidding. All right, meet me outside of Wizard City in your freshest wizard johns. [sneezes] H-hurry, princess. This is it? Yeah, man, this is it. Well, what's with the wall? Wo-o-o-o-o-o-o-op! [ What's over there? Nothing. Just more mountains. I think the wall knows we're not wizards. But we can trick it, right? How do you trick a wall? Don't know, man. I give up. For reals? Yeah, I'm no good at this! [ That was a nice try, man. Guys, hold up! I got the password from the Ice King. Apparently, the barrier only responds to the voice of real wizards. [ [on tape recorder] No way! I'm no rat! I am bound by the sacred trust of esoteric knowledge! Say the password, Ice King! You think I'll just hand you the keys to the city? I'd rather die. Say the password. Ow! My pinky! [Princess bubblegum smiles nervously and shrugs] Ow. [sniffles] Thank you. [Finn blushes in embarrassment and Jake facepalms and shakes his head in disapproval] You know, no one has touched me in months. Could you touch me again? Password! Now!!' Ow! Ohh! Ohh! "Wizards Rule!" THE PASSWORD IS WIZARDS RULE!" AAH-- Whoa. [The wall of rock fades away and reveals Wizard City behind it.] Powerful magicks. Pshh! It's a vocal registry rigged to a vibration modulator. The wall's still there. It's just the density's all wobbled. Boo. Um...That's what it is, Jake. All right, what am I, then? [ It looks like a mutation. Boring. Yeah, right. Just 'cause I know my shnoz. [looking around at the wizards in Wizard City] Look at these dopes. Half of these spells are all working on entanglement principles. "Entanglement" is a spell where you get trapped in tree roots, and sometimes they spike out and hook your flesh, and you got to be like, "My body is clay, my spirit feels no pain." Then you chop your way out and kill the wizard! That's not what I meant, but whatevs. Where's this magic shop? These signs are weird. Let's ask somebody. Hey, dudes. [ Stand back, citizen. Yeesh. Okay. Who are these guys? They're like the city po-po or something. [talking to a blue man] Stranson Doughblow, you are guilty of impersonating a wizard, as well as purchasing magic items from Ron James' Spell Palace. Bingo. Wait! I know some coin tricks! The sentence is... [ Woaah! Oh, my shrah! Come on. You saw that, right? Welcome, brothers! Sorry about that biz outside. Ha ha ha! Oh, what a silly non-magic user, right? All right, bros. Ronny James got mad spells for wizards of all exps. No need for memorization, incantation, or hard-to-find bularoo. Just rip one of these babies open, and you'll be like, "ta-da!" We got a bottle-returns program and all that shwazaa. So, wha-za? We need a spell for the cold. Heck, yeah, brah. I got something. [ How's it work? [with aggression] It works by magic. It's a spell. Dude... What? I'm curious. So, what's in it? It's my secret brew, dawg. So you want to sell me a product with no information? [scowling at Princess Bubblegum] It's a cold spell. Made from what? MAGIC. What's the magic made out of, ding-dong? Y'all is fakes! No, wait! [ You're busted! Yoink! [ [while running] Hey, Jake? What? Is PB straight-up naked right now? Dude, don't make me feel any more awkward than I already do! Dang! It's a dead end! [Whistling] Abracadaniel! Huh? Do I know you? Dude, it's me, Oh, guys, I don't know, that's not my place. I just work here and I- Please! Come on, man! Shush! [while pushing Abracadaniel, Princess Bubblegum and Jake inside the secret door] Come on, come on, come on, come on. Yeah, when the lamb comes back, Laser Wizard puts him on the altar. And then I extract his forehead, right, Bufo? [as a hologram on a bookshelf] Ooh! Right, yeah, that's the plan. What the blutt, Abracadaniel?! [grabbing his wand from his sleeve] What part of "secret society" don't you understand? Whoa, whoa, whoa! We don't want trouble! Just let us rest for a bit. Oh, we gonna put you to rest. For good! You are guilty of harboring non-magic users! Barrier! [ We need an exit! [while hiding behind a bookshelf with Princess Bubblegum and Finn] That's what you get for asking a magician about his tricks, PB! Ghosts of the warp-plane, grant us passage into your realm. [The three wizards vanish, leaving their clothes only. The policemen stop shooting their lasers.] [hiding under a table] Hey, guys, wait for me! Shush! Whoa! Receive your just punishment! No! As ruler of the Candy Kingdom, I demand parley with the Grand Master Wizard! Princess Bubblegum! For shame. And I'm very disappointed in you, [points at Abracadaniel with his water kettle and water pours from it.] Abracadaniel! However, Princess, since you have always been a dear friend to the wizard community, just say "Wizards Rule" and you're all free to go. Wha-? Really? [flicking his hair back and showing his ear, to show that he's listening.] Mmm? Psst! Wizards rule! No! [coughs out a cat] Oh! [The [Finn puts her into a lock to keep her from harming the Grand Master Wizard] All magic is science! You just don't know what you're doing, so you call it magic! And, well.., it's.. ridiculous. Wizard prison! All of you! Wizard prison! Nooooooo! Ridiculous, huh? This isn't happening! Ho! [hits Abracadaniel with his cane] Ouch! Would you look at that? Somebody better start crying into my hand! Ugh! That's sick! [sarcastic] You're right. I'm so ashamed. [throws another pair of underwear at Finn.] Ugh! [ Come on! Move it! [He opens a cell door and points in it with his cane. He ushers Finn and Jake into it.] You two, in here! I got cells upstairs for Princess and Milkface. [screaming into pillow] I got traumatized by those underpanties. [sighs] This sucks. Hey, let's count the days. [ [ Yeah, I'm okay. Sleep tight, Princess! Good night. [mutters to self] Stupid wizards... PB! Over here! [ Whoa! [The prisoners scream in shock. Bubblegum, I hereby challenge you to an honorable prison stabbing to the death! BRING IT ON. [ What?! Are you two crazy?! I've had it with you silly wizards! Jake, we have to do something! We need to get out of this. Yeah, we still got to heal the snuffins out of Starchie with this little baby here. [ [looking at the bottle] All this for a cold spell. [He opens the bottle, which releases a blue, icy vapor.] What the-? Ice? [He closes the bottle.] Hmm. Hey, Milkface isn't dead! [Abracadaniel gets up and holds his hair out of his face.] Strike me down and restore my honor. No!! Sorry, but you have to kill him. Otherwise, we'll kill all of yous two both. Peebs! Incoming! [ What? It's a cold spell, not a cold spell. Prisoner, drop that contraband magic! [ Get down! [Scene changes to after the entire cafeteria is completely covered in ice. Jake has protected Your magicks are powerful, PB. Okay. Let's get out of here. Poor Starchie. All that trouble and we couldn't get any magic for him. Hmm. I've got an idea. [moaning] Oooooo! Eh? Finally! Healing magic. Oh, I can feel it! No! [lifting the serum] Rubeldubel dingeldongel-[  Okay. I'm going to lower the screen. Tell me what you see. Crunchy, you look like a rainbow! It's beautiful! Can you guys see that? Nope. Only you can see it because you're hooked up to the aura visualizer. But actually I'm lying. We can see everything you see on this screen. Now I'm gonna send that image into Crunchy. Whoa! The aura's gone! Except... [lifts monitor away, aura is still visible around Crunchy] Crunchy's true essence manifested in the material plane! I wanna see Peppermint Butler's aura! [chuckles] You don't wanna see that! Yeah, we do! Right, Princess? Sure, Finn! Just let me re-calibrate the device! No! Bunk that, I'm tired! C'mon, Finn! Oh, yeah. Yeah, me and Jake, we gotta peace out. G'night! Hey- what's goin' on in here? Yo, guys! Hey, Finn! Whoa, what's that? Security cams? Yeah, man! You gotta see some crazy stuff— Yo, shut up! Oh, shoot... What? Nothin'! What is it? Nothing! Show us now! Show you what? What you said! We didn't say nothin'! Too late for take-backs! We practically know everything already! Now show us! Okay, but you can't tell anyone. Yeah, this is our weird secret. Of course, dude! All right. Now look at monitor three. Can you see it? Oh, yeah! That's, uh... Who is that? That's Chocoberry. Why are you guys spyin' on Chocoberry? No, man! Look there, in the corner! Who's that? Zoom in, dude! Plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus... WAAAAAAAAAAAAUH! Lemongrab! What the—? This is our weird secret, okay? Remember that! How long has this been going on? He's shown up every night for the past two weeks! He goes to different rooms and just stands there! And you didn't tell me?! If we told you, then we knew you'd mess up our weird TV show! Banana guarding is boring! I'm gonna talk to him. Oh, no! Ya see?! Sorry, guys! Lemongrab! [flicks on lightswitch] NNYUGH! [winces at light] Why are you stalking my peeps?! I AM WITHIN MY RIGHTS! Yeah, but what are you doing?! It's creepin' me out! ...Uh... I AM THE EARL... ...Yeah? Wait! What do you mean "nothing"? In your dreams, you freak! [to Lemongrab, who is now slithering out of the window like a snake] But you don't get along with others! I don't understand you, Lemongrab! [Sighs and sadly presses her hands and face to the glass] What are we gonna do? Something totally bum-slops. No, no, we won't go! No, no, we won't go! No, no... Please, please! All I need is three healthy volunteers to move in with Lemongrab! He's all by himself with no one to govern! No, no, we won't go! No, no we won't go! Come on, Mr. Cupcake! Just for a little while? UUGH! [breaks own arm] I can't, Princess! My arm is broken! Dude! You didn't have to do that... Alright! What's it gonna take, people?! Two things, Princess! Yeah, that's right! Back up, fools! You got nerve showing your faces here, notorious Pup Gang! Buncha bad apples! Back up, Finn! I'll take you out! We came out of hidin', 'cuz all y'alls is scareds of Lemon Man! But we ain't afraid! So we gots demands! ...And what is that? One—total amnesty for past crimes committed by the Pup Gang! Mmmm... Granted. Yo wait! They threw a basketball at my head one time! Are you gonna let that slide?! We only did that 'cuz you're old! You sacks! I'll rip your cups! Jake, please! What is your second demand? We want the big cash money wad! Enough to provide for our delinquent mothers, so that hopefully they'll show us the love we always dreamed about in our sad, young lives! Hmm. I grant you the big cash money wad! Now off with you, to Castle Lemongrab! Yo, Lemongrease! We're gonna live here at Lemongrab now! Yes. I'm Blombo, what is that? What? On Blombo's ears... That's his headphones! BLOMBO! Take them off! Blombo, you must heed my INSTRUCTIONS! TAKE OFF YOUR THIIINGS!!! Whoa! Settle down, Lemongrease! [lifts headphone up on one ear] What? What's goin' on? All unfit citizens of Lemongrab must be RECONDITIONED! Man! Are you crazy?! You guys... What? Where are we? YEEEEEOU are in my reconditioning chamber! [He stands before a small table, on which is a lever] You will receive four to three units of juice now! [He pushes the lever forward, licking his lips, and the floor of the chamber electrocutes the Pup Gang. They scream, and the Earl looks on with wide-eyed, manic wonder.] Oooouuah! Crunchy, wake up, Crunchy. Aaagh... Glob? Is that you? No sign of Lemongrab for three days! I think it worked! Maybe... Let's keep looking. [Flips through various views, and finally sees Lemongrab standing before a sleeping Starchie, his hands clasped behind his back.] Awww, geez! [ [sleepily] Nhuh? What happened to your new citizens? [sleepily and monotonously] They didn't understand my lemon stylez. I like this way better. Hmmm... I wonder if you don't understand their candy stylez! C'mon, lemme show you something! You see, Earl, candy people are mad special. [begins cuddling Crunchy] They need constant stroking, and snuggling... [groans nervously] Ah! [baby-talks to Crunchy, who giggles with delight. MMMMN?! [delivers a sharp poke to the forehead of Crunchy, who smiles up at him and giggles] Uh... Goo goo? Uh... Goo? [Lemongrab begins grunting and shouting nervously, and begins batting Crunchy on the head. In a matter of seconds, Lemongrab is screaming in terror, smacking Crunchy and punching him on the head. Lemongrab lets out a high-pitched shriek of terror, bolts up, and throws Crunchy onto the ground] PUT YOU IN MY OVEN! IT'S GROOOSS!!! [Princess Bubblegum tends to the terrified and crying Crunchy] And who says YOUR way's right, anyway? I look in the lemon heart you gave me and see MYYY lemon way to act! And that MUST be right! [Finn and Jake glare at Lemongrab. Princess Bubblegum look at him nervously. Suddenly, Lemongrab lets out a loud, piercing shriek and begins to flail his arms like limp spaghetti noodles. He jumps onto the back of Lemon Camel, who until then had been sleeping peacefully.] MOOO!!! [ Man, that guy's a real D-list! Oh, dear! His Candy Citizens! Let's crush this mess all accordingly! Crazy lightbulb hardcore style! Yeah! No. He's my responsibility. I have to try to help him! Okay, that's cool, too. Hop on! Lemongrab? Lemongrab! No Lemongrab. C'mon! Let's find the Pup Gang quick! Wait. I have a plan. You guys go on ahead. Okay, cool! What do you got, Jake? Just an empty room with a catcher's mitt! ...Weird. [Gasp] Oh, no! [They open one door, to find the Pup Gang unconscious at the bottom of the Reconditioning Chamber. They desperately try to revive them. While trying to do so, Lemongrab steps into the room, and sees Finn and Jake. He abruptly closes the door on them, and walks over to his control panel to shock them, smiling gleefully and talking softly in a tranquil fury.] This is serious! Pup Gang got four units... Maaaybe... Maybe ten units for trespassers? [He shocks Finn, Jake, and the Pup Gang, who scream in agony. Jake lifts up his arm to reach them to the top of the chamber through the air vent.] YOU GOT TRICKS, HUH?! YOU GOTTA FALL DOWN SOMETIME! AND WHEN YOU DO, TWELVE UNITS! Lemongrab, stop! Please! Earl, I can help you! NO! NO! NO MORE HELPING! [unsheathes Sound Sword] YOOOU'RE THE ONE WHO MADE ME THIS WAY! HOW CAN YOOOU HELP?! YOU WANNA UNLOAD YOUR PUNKEST BOYS ON ME?! AND TRYYY TO CHANGE MY WAYS?! YEH POISON! YEH POISON!!! [backs up the terrified princess into a corner] YOU NEED RECONDITIONING! [His eyes immediately grow to an enormous, manic size, as he swings his sword at the princess] RECONDITIIIIIION!!! YEEEEOOOOOOOUUUU!!! Whoa! [ Whoa, whoa, what the hey?! Wait, Lemongrab, look! [ Hello? Am I in the right room? NEEEEH! WHAT?! WHO'S THIS RIGAMAROLE?! I'm Lemongrab! O-oh! I made him for you, in your pantry. For you to be with! [approaches Lemongrab clone cautiously] T-two Lemongrabs? Hmmm! [Lemongrab begins poking his clone all over his face and body. Soon after, the Lemongrab clone does the same to Lemongrab. When they're finished, they smile.] Hmmm... Yeah, okay! Yeah! [The Lemongrabs close their eyes and nuzzle their faces together, smiling and humming happily] All in favor of pardoning the prisoners? Aye! PARDONS FOR ALL! Good bye, Lemongrabs! [Waving] Take care, boys! Yes! Yes, indeed! A-ha-ha! A lemon gives by taking... ...and cares by YELLING! Hmm! Hmm! Well, okay! STOP BY ANY TIIIME!!! BUT CALL FIRST!!! YES, GOOD-BYYYE!!! MARKOVEND

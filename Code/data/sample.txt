MARKOVSTART Ha-ha-ha. Okay, now make him look angrier! Alright, give me a second. Nope, not funny anymore. Sorry, dude—you ruined it. Man, I don't have patience for this animation junk. Whoever does this must have no life whatsoev— Oof... Why did I do that? Yo Finn, did you order a brick? Hm, I don't think so. [Reads the floppy disk that is taped to the brick. It says, "Email to Finn + Who's it from? Looks like Ice King's handwriting. Eeeww! Escape, Jake! Escape! Alright, alright, hold on. [ Whaa? Aaaah! Hey, Princess! What now, Ice King? Remember that time last summer when you said you'd only go out on a date with me if I was the last guy on Ooo? I doubt I said that. P-bubs! P-bubs, P-bubs! The computer went... Open video and... The email... Potato trampoline... Brick window with the plastic... Then crashment! Banana hummingbird... 47 grapes! [cleans throat] Anyone having any... [robotic voice] computer problems? [A laugh track plays and stops once How do we stop the computer worm, you pile of goo?! E-ha-ha-ha-ha! My worm exists beyond your comprehension within the universal source code... STOP TALKING LIKE A NERD AND GIVE IT TO US STRAIGHT!!! Once the glitch does its work, the whole world will be deleted! Except for me and my "Bubblygums." [Attempts to kiss Princess Bubblegum, who moves him away with a stick and then throws it at his face.] Ow!! Well, see y'all! I'm gonna prepare for my... date. Ahaha! [Teleports away.] [Crashes out of the door of a house with a glitchy face, running in circles.] AAAAAHH! MY BEAUTIFUL FACE!! MY HOPES AND DREAMS—RUINED!!! [Emits beeps and runs away] Don't worry, Princess, we'll take care of this thing. Oh, me too. [Loads her candy horse tranquilizer] I'm gonna take care of it, too. [Slowly walks away] Okay! [Runs away with Jake] [Grabs Mr. Cupcake] Don't worry, guy! I got you! [Mr. Cupcake disappears.] YEOW! JAKE, HELP ME!!! [talking to Chocoberry] Okay, shh, you're safe! [Chocoberry's arms and legs fell apart then disappeared.] Come here, guy! No... Stay away from me! I'm trying to help you, yo! I saw what happened when you picked up Todd. [Fades away] But... No!! Jake, this isn't working! We need a plan. Aw, man. Okay, here is my dream plan. You were wearin' tights made of green feathers. These tiny green feathers. And I was this wisecracking coelacanth that only ate popcorn. Anyway, we were in this— THAT PLAN'S NOT GOOD! Hold on, I'm almost done. So we were trapped inside this huge egg, and after a while you started dancing in this kind of sign language. And then Ice King's glitchy stuff started eatin' my dream up. I peed in my pants, but you went up and talked to it. You just... talked to it. Then talk to it I will. [Grabs a bit of glitch static from the ground.] Hey man, tell me the haps. Yeah, tell us your feelings! Get deep. "Sllabfoog uoy pleh tnac I..." [running and screaming] OH, SWEET LORD, MY FACE! MY PERFECT...!! Slaw frog yokel snacky. Snacky slaw frog yokel. Sea salt yack let a snacky. Yeah, that sounds good! AAAAAAAAAAH...!!! [Digging in the static.] Jake, I think I found a way in! No, wait, dude. I think I cracked the code! There's no time! [Grabs Jake and enters a portal.] AAAAAAH!!! AAAAH... AAH!!! This must be the universal source code! Huh? Ice King and Bubblegum? Jake! Don't touch anything! Huh? I think the shiny things are the building blocks of the universe, man! They store every single thing that is a thing back on thing! Okay, enough exploring already. Where is this glitch guy? I'm gonna smash his jimmies. [Looks to the front and cringes in fear] Jake, what is it? Oh, Princess Bubblegum? Guess who? Can you guess? Can you? I'll give you 3 chances. No. OK, four chances. [Imitates rimshot] [Stands up] Ice King, give me the anti-virus, or I'll shoot you with my candy horse tranquilizer! But sugar, look what I brought you! A box of chocos! [Eats a chocolate] Hm... Still good. [Box disappears] Argh. Look, I can't prove it, but... [Bubblegum shoots him.] ...you made a promise we'd have at least one date if... [PB shots him twice, and he starts speaking slowly.] ...if I was the last person on Ooo... [ Okay, well, even if I did promised, you're not the last person on Ooo, because I'm still here. [PB starts kissing her left palm.] Well, uh... Ooh, I-I have a hand too, y'know? I can lend you one... [ Oh, that's disgusting. Grrrr!!! Come on, Jake, pull it together, man. Jake? Oh, no, my arm! [grabs arm.] We had so many great times together... Dooby, dooby, dooby, dooby, skeebily, skeebily, dapdy doo... Huh? Who's that? [Sees it was Righty] Awww. [confidently] Let's do this... for Righty! That's the spirit! [Grabs sword.] ADVENTURE TI--!!! [ [Kisses her hand several times, and then licks it, after that, she pushes it away.] ...No. [Continues kissing the hand.] Oh, come on, woman, I'm trying to be nice! Can't you at least make the best out of this? [PB walks to [Stomping Ice King's head.] GIVE ME THE ANTI-VIRUS! I can't, monkey peeps, I didn't make one! The glitch will delete everything until we're all that's last! You mean, forever?! Well, yeah! I mean, you say that like it's a bad thing. Come on, Finn and Jake.... So, hey, Finn, how do you plan on taking this guy out? [voice is muffled by the sword] Okay, I guess it's worth trying. Aah! What we do now? We gotta get those things... outta his stomach. Hey, Finn! Remember that gross video Ice King sent? [disgusted] Ugh, yeah. [confidently] Yeah!! Let's double team these locks! [Bites Finn's hair and starts swallowing it along with Finn. The glitch gets more glitchy. As the glitch roars and starts coughing, it pukes out all of the things it ate from the universal source code. Weird, random stuff starts to happen, it loads and the land of Ooo starts reloading with the candy people. By a pond, Finn and We did it! [They high-five and start coughing.] You should wash your hair! You should wash your mouth! [They start walking as Ice King is seeing the land of Ooo reloading.] Huh? No way! Impossible! [Makes noises and when he moves, the house he was in reloads. His head was already outside of the house, so his head gets stuck in the wall.] Uh... Everything back to normal, huh? Seems like it. [running] Aah! My face!! My beautiful face is back to normal!!! Aaah!!!! [Runs around Finn and Jake, Finn stops him.] Hey, have you seen the princess anywhere? Yes, she's in the Ice King's castle. AUGGH! [Starts running again.] [Destroying Ice King's holographic computer with a baseball bat] Useless-- [Hits it with the baseball bat.] Ugh! --computer!  You sassa-frassin-- Nu!! --hammer-slammin-- Ruh! --wamma-jammin... [Stomps on the computer.] Ugh! [elbow drops on it as the table collapses.] Ugh! [Hits the computer twice.] Ah-ya-ya-ya-ya! [Hits it hard. She sees Finn and Jake.] Finn and Jake! [Throws the baseball bat away.] My heroes! [Picks them up and hugs them.] Yeah, no big deal. Geez... [PB and I missed you! I missed you, too! [They kiss.] Whoa, you taste different, baby! You been playin' basketball in someone else's hockey rink? Ahem... Hey, Bubs, where's the Ice King? I wanna kick his boingloings! Yeah. Where is he? I wanna kick his boingloings, too! Uh... guys? Hello? Princess. Uh... Let's forget all about this... [the snake-spider hybrid wanders onscreen and bites Hey, brother. Pass me that jam, won't you? Sure. Thanks. So, how is your toast? Pretty good. Funny, though, I can kind of taste the toast's emotions or something. Getting ground into flour and then made into bread really did a number on this wheat's sense of self. That's a pretty hyper‐developed sense of taste you've got there. Hey, you seem kind of different. Nope. Same old You're blue, you've got those five eyes, you're way bigger, and you keep discovering strange new abilities. I think this might be a situation. Where's this coming from [Gasps] Whoops! Tuck‐tuck. See? Same old Ahhh! Whoa. [ Ahhh! Jake is a crab! Ahhh! [ Same old Jake. If you say so. Hmm. I think I'm handling these minor changes pretty well. Besides, a lot of people are different these days. Dirt Beer Guy, you're practically a zombie. How are you dealing with it? Well, I'm basically the same as before. The difference is only physical. So you agree Finn is really overreacting? Totally. You're the same person as before. Heck yeah! I'm still the same old Wait, you're Jake?! Uh, pardon me. Oh, dear, oh, dear. That's really something. You know, I think I figured out why I make people uneasy. They're used to yellow [Speaks Korean] 자기야, 내가 좀 고쳐볼게. (Babe, I'll try to fix it.) [then tries (and fails) at changing Jake's color] [Laughs] Lady, that tickles. [Speaks Korean] 젠장! (Damn!) It's okay, lady. Thanks for trying, but I'm fine, really. [Speaks Korean] 어떤 일이 일어나도 나는 널 사랑해. (I love you no matter what happens.) I love me, too. Jermaine? Ahh, mountain colors. I'm painting this mountain. I think it's really coming together. That's the mountain? Yep. I'm a mirror. Hey, who's your friend? [Warren Ampersand appears] Yipe! Dad? Look at this. [Playing with a yoyo] I can almost walk the dog. Your body looks like one of my paintings. Pretty weird dream, huh? This isn't just a dream body, this is what my body looks like when I'm awake. Oh. Got it. Ha! I've got it! What? [Now with 5 eyes, and 8 arms, each holding a yoyo] I can almost walk the dog. Finn, you up? Yeah, man. I had a really bad dream last night. So ominous. These images are going to haunt me for, like, forever. Sometimes it helps me if I draw a bad dream in picture form. My crayons! It was a weird scene, all right. Chanting ladies, labyrinths, classical sculpture. And Jermaine was there, too. The weird thing was that he was painting abstract art. So? F.Y.I., Jermaine hates abstract art. He would never paint something non‐representational. Maybe he's just trying something new? It's not in his nature. Why would he all of a sudden get into painting meaningless shapes? He's probably fine. Just feels so out of character, you know, for Jermaine. How's the drawing? Just squiggles. MARKOVEND
